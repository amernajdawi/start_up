Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
Life-cycle GHG emissions from the generation of electricity from geothermal energy are lower than
100 g CO  2 e/kWh. Life-cycle GHG emission savings are calculated using Commission Recommendation 
2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using ISO 14067:2018 or ISO 14064-1:2018. Quantified life-cycle GHG
emissions are verified by an independent third party.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  For the operation of high-enthalpy geothermal energy systems, adequate 
abatement systems are in place to reduce emission levels in order not to
hamper the achievement of air quality limit values set out in Directive
2004/107/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (  166  ) and 
Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (  167  ). 
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
4.7.  Electricity generation from renewable non-fossil gaseous and liquid fuels  
Description of the activity  
Construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity using gaseous and liquid fuels
of renewable origin. This activity does not include electricity generation from the exclusive use of biogas and bio-
liquid fuels (see Section 4.8 of this Annex).  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular D35.11 and
F42.22 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. Life-cycle GHG emissions from the generation of electricity using renewable gaseous and liquid fuels are
lower than 100 g CO  2 e/kWh. 
Life-cycle GHG emissions are calculated based on project-specific data, where available, using Recommendation
2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using ISO 14067:2018 (  168  ) or ISO 14064-1:2018 (  169  ). 
Quantified life-cycle GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party.
