ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 145/164For exposures where the use of proceeds is known, credit institutions shall consider, for the numerator of the
GAR for financial undertakings, the gross carrying amount of loans and advances and debt securities of relevant accounting portfolios to financial undertakings to the extent and proportion in which those exposures
finance Taxonomy-aligned economic activities. The assessment of whether that requirement has been met shall
be based on information provided by the counterparty. Double counting shall not be allowed. Where the same exposure is relevant for two environmental objectives, credit institutions shall allocate it to the most relevant objective.
For exposures where the use of proceeds is not known, the numerator of the GAR for financial undertakings
shall be calculated based on the counterparties’ KPIs calculated under this Regulation. The amount of loans
and advances, debt securities and equity holdings of relevant accounting portfolios to financial undertakings to be considered in the numerator of the ratio shall be the sum of their gross carrying amount, weighted by the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities with breakdown for all the environmental objectives and
enabling activities for each counterparty. For the climate change mitigation objective, the breakdown shall also
contain transitional activities for each counterparty.
Where the counterparty is another credit institution as defined in Article 4(1), point (1), of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013, and, only for this purpose, a multilateral development bank referred to in Article 117(1), second subparagraph, or Article 117(2) of that Regulation, the turnover-based and CapEx based KPIs used shall be the gross carrying amount of debt securities, loans and advances and equity instruments of relevant
accounting portfolios weighted by the “Total GAR of the counterparty”, that is gross carrying amount
multiplied by “Total GAR” of the counterparty.’;
(j) in Section 1.2.1.3, the first paragraph is replaced by the following:
‘GAR for retail exposures to residential real estate or house renovation loans shall be calculated as a proportion
of loans to households collateralised by residential immovable property or granted for house renovation purposes that is Taxonomy-aligned in accordance with the relevant technical screening criteria for buildings, in
particular renovation and acquisition and ownership in accordance with Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6,
