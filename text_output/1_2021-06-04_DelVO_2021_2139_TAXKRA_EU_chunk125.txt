4.18.  Cogeneration of heat/cool and power from geothermal energy  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of facilities co-generating heat/cool and power from geothermal energy.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular D35.11 and
D35.30 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The life-cycle GHG emissions from the combined generation of heat/cool and power (  191  ) from geothermal 
energy are lower than 100 g CO  2 e per 1 kWh of energy output from the combined generation. 
Life-cycle GHG emissions are calculated based on project-specific data, where available, using Commission
Recommendation 2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using ISO 14067:2018 or ISO 14064-1:2018.
Quantified life-cycle GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party.

(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A
