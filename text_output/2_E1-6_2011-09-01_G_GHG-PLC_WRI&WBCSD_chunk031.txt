CHAPTER 07 Boundary Setting
guidance3. Identify component inputs and upstream processing
steps necessary to create and transport the finished
product, aligning the processes with the appropriate
life cycle stage
4. Identify the energy and material flows associated with
each upstream process, including inputs that directly
impact the productâ€™s ability to perform its function
(e.g., fertilizers, lubricants) and outputs such as waste
and co-products
5. For cradle-to-grave inventories, identify the
downstream processing steps and energy and material
flows needed to distribute, store, and use the studied
product
6. For cradle-to-grave inventories, identify the energy
and material inputs needed for the end-of-life of the
studied product
Figure 7.5 illustrates the steps to develop a process map
with a generic, simplified cradle-to-grave inventory. For a cradle-to-gate inventory, the use of the product
is unknown and therefore the process map ends when
the studied product is a finished intermediate product,
typically when it leaves the production stage.  
7.3.3  Identifying attributable processes  
in the use and end-of-life stages
Companies need to make assumptions about the specific
attributable processes used to create, distribute, and sell
the studied product as they develop their process map.
Because the way a product is used (often referred to
as the use profile) can vary significantly between users,
companies often find it difficult to determine attributable
processes for the use stage.
The first step is to look at the functional unit definition
for the product. The defined function, as well as the
duration and quality of service provided by the product,
should help identify the use profile processes. Because
the service life does not always correspond directly to
the use profile, companies should assume a profile that
most accurately represents the use of their product while
