Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  N/A  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  For manufacturing of new batteries, components and materials, the activity 
assesses the availability of and, where feasible, adopts techniques that
support:
(a) reuse and use of secondary raw materials and reused components in
products manufactured;
(b) design for high durability, recyclability, easy disassembly and adapta ­
bility of products manufactured;
(c) information on and traceability of substances of concern throughout
the life cycle of the manufactured products.
Recycling processes meet the conditions set out in Article 12 and in
Annex III, Part B, of Directive 2006/66/EC, including the use of the
latest relevant Best Available Techniques, the achievement of the effi ­
ciencies specified for lead-acid batteries, nickel-cadmium batteries and
for other chemistries. These processes ensure the recycling of the metal
content to the highest degree that is technically feasible while avoiding
excessive costs.
Where applicable, facilities carrying out recycling processes meet the
requirements laid down in Directive 2010/75/EU.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix C to this 
Annex.
Batteries comply with the applicable sustainability rules on the placing on
the market of batteries in the Union, including restrictions on the use of
hazardous substances in batteries, including Regulation (EC)
No 1907/2006 and Directive 2006/66/EC.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
3.5.  Manufacture of energy efficiency equipment for buildings  
Description of the activity  
Manufacture of one or more of the following energy efficiency equipment products and their key components (  109  ) 
for buildings:  
(a) windows with U-value lower or equal to 1,0 W/m2K;  
(b) doors with U-value lower or equal to 1,2 W/m2K;  
(c) external wall systems with U-value lower or equal to 0,5 W/m2K;  
(d) roofing systems with U-value lower or equal to 0,3 W/m2K;  
(e) insulating products with a lambda value lower or equal to 0,06 W/mK;  
(f) household appliances falling into the highest two populated classes of energy efficiency classes in accordance
