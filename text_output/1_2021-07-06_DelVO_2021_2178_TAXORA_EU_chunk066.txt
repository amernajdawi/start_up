1.2.1.4. GAR for loans and advances financing public housing and other specialised lending to public authorities
Where credit institutions have a business model based to a great extent on financing public housing, they shall disclose a
KPI concerning the proportion of compliance with the technical screening criteria in accordance with Section 7.7 of
Annex I to Climate Delegated Act of buildings whose purchase the credit institution is financing. This GAR shall be
estimated and disclosed by the credit institution as a proportion of loans to municipalities financing public housing
compliant with the technical screening criteria in accordance with Section 7.7 of Annex I to Climate Delegated Act
compared to total loans to municipalities financing public housing. The credit institution shall include disclosures of stock and flow.
The methodology for the computation of the numerator and denominator shall be the same as the methodology for
residential real estate lending.
For the financing of other activities and assets than public housing, credit institutions shall consider the gross carrying
amount of the project finance exposures to the public authority to the extent and proportion that the project funded
finances a Taxonomy-aligned economic activity. The assessment of whether that requirement has been complied with shall
be based on information provided by the public authority on the project or activities to which the proceeds will be applied.
Credit institutions shall provide information on the type of economic activity that is funded. Double counting shall not be
allowed. Where the same specialised lending exposure is relevant for two environmental objectives, credit institutions shall
allocate it to the most relevant objective.
1.2.1.5. Other on-balance sheet exposures â€“ Repossessed real estate collaterals
Credit institutions shall disclose the KPI for the proportion of compliance with the technical screening criteria in Section
7.7 of Annex I to Climate Delegated Act of their commercial and residential repossessed real estate collateral held-for-sale
portfolio for the environmental objective of climate change mitigation as a proportion of commercial and residential
repossessed real estate collateral complying with the technical screening criteria in Section 7.7 of Annex I to Climate Delegated Act, compared to total commercial and residential repossessed real estate collateral.
Credit institutions shall disclose information for the stock of loans as of the disclosure reference date, and information on
the flows of new assets during the disclosure period.
The numerator of the ratio shall include the gross carrying amount of commercial and residential repossessed real estate
collaterals compliant with the technical screening criteria for buildings in Section 7.7 of Annex I to Climate Delegated Act.
The denominator shall include the total gross carrying amount of held-for-sale commercial and residential real estate
collaterals repossessed by the credit institution.
