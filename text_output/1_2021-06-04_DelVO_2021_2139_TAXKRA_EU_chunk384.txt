3. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and
take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line
with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports (  527  ), scientific peer-reviewed 
publications and open source (  528  ) or paying models. 
4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people,
of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  529  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  530  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The vessels are not dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Measures are in place to manage waste, both in the use phase and in the 
end-of-life of the vessel, in accordance with the waste hierarchy.
For battery-operated vessels, those measures include reuse and recycling of
batteries and electronics, including critical raw materials therein.
For existing ships above 500 gross tonnage and the new-built ones
replacing them, the activity complies with the requirements of Regulation
(EU) No 1257/2013 relating to the inventory of hazardous materials. The
scrap ships are recycled in facilities included on the European List of ship
recycling facilities as laid down in Commission Decision 2016/2323.
The activity complies with Directive (EU) 2019/883 as regards the
protection of the marine environment against the negative effects from
discharges of waste from ships.
The ship is operated in accordance with Annex V to the IMO MARPOL
Convention, in particular with a view to producing reduced quantities of
waste and to reducing legal discharges, by managing its waste in a
sustainable and environmentally sound manner.

( 529  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta n­
eously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more
diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-eff icient
and systemic interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of
ecosystem services (version of 4.6.2021: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/nature-
based-solutions_en/).
