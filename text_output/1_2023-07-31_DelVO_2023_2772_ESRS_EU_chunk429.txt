ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 182/284AR 12. When disclosing the alignment of its policies with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the
undertaking shall consider that the Guiding Principles refer to the International Bill of Human Rights, which
consist of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two Covenants that implement it, as well as the
International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental Rights and Principles at Work and the core

AR 13. When explaining how external-facing policies are embedded, the undertaking may, for example, consider internal

and channels (for example, flyers, newsletters, dedicated websites, social media, face to face interactions, workers’
