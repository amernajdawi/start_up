The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular C24.10,
C24.20, C24.31, C24.32, C24.33, C24.34, C24.51 and C24.52 in accordance with the statistical classification
of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is a transitional activity as referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU)
2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The activity manufactures one of the following:
(a) iron and steel where GHG emissions (  111  ), reduced by the amount of emissions assigned to the production of 
waste gases in accordance with point 10.1.5(a) of Annex VII to Regulation (EU) 2019/331 do not exceed the
following values applied to the different manufacturing process steps:
(i) hot metal = 1,331 (  112  ) tCO  2 e/t product; 
(ii) sintered ore = 0,163 (  113  ) tCO  2 e/t product; 
(iii) coke (excluding lignite coke) = 0,144 (  114  ) tCO  2 e/t product; 
(iv) iron casting = 0,299 (  115  ) tCO  2 e/t product; 
(v) electric Arc Furnace (EAF) high alloy steel = 0,266 (  116  ) tCO  2 e/t product; 
(vi) electric Arc Furnace (EAF) carbon steel = 0,209 (  117  ) tCO  2 e/t product. 
(b) steel in electric arc furnaces (EAFs) producing EAF carbon steel or EAF high alloy steel, as defined in
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331 and where the steel scrap input relative to product
output is not lower than:
(i) 70 % for the production of high alloy steel;
(ii) 90 % for the production of carbon steel.
Where the CO  2 that would otherwise be emitted from the manufacturing process is captured for the purpose of 
underground storage, the CO  2 is transported and stored underground, in accordance with the technical screening 
criteria set out in Sections 5.11 and 5.12 of this Annex.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A
