(b) cement from grey clinker or alternative hydraulic binder, where the specific GHG emissions (  101  ) from the 
clinker and cement or alternative binder production are lower than 0,469 (  102  ) tCO  2 e per tonne of cement or 
alternative binder manufactured.
Where CO  2 that would otherwise be emitted from the manufacturing process is captured for the purpose of 
underground storage, the CO  2 is transported and stored underground, in accordance with the technical screening 
criteria set out in Sections 5.11 and 5.12 of this Annex.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix C to this 
Annex.
Emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the latest relevant
best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including the best available
techniques (BAT) conclusions for the production of cement, lime and
magnesium oxide (  103  ). 
No significant cross-media effects occur (  104  ). 
For manufacture of cement employing hazardous wastes as alternative
fuels, measures are in place to ensure the safe handling of waste.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
3.8.  Manufacture of aluminium  
Description of the activity

___________  
( 101  ) Calculated in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/331.  
( 102  ) Reflecting the average value of the 10 % most efficient installations in 2016 and 2017 (t CO  2 equivalents/t) for grey cement clinker 
as set out in the Annex to the Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/447, multiplied by the clinker to cement ratio of 0,65.  
( 103  ) Commission Implementing Decision 2013/163/EU of 26 March 2013 establishing the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions 
under Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on industrial emissions for the production of cement,
lime and magnesium oxide (OJ L 100, 9.4.2013, p. 1).
