front on the scope, level and objective of the verification.This agreement (often referred to as the scope of work) willaddress issues such as which information is to be includedin the verification (e.g., head office consolidation only orinformation from all sites), the level of scrutiny to whichselected data will be subjected (e.g., desk top review or on-site review), and the intended use of the results of theverification). The materiality threshold is another item tobe considered in the scope of work. It will be of key consid-eration for both the verifier and the company, and is linkedto the objectives of the verification.
The scope of work is influenced by what the verifier actu-
ally finds once the verification commences and, as a result,the scope of work must remain sufficiently flexible toenable the verifier to adequately complete the verification.
A clearly defined scope of work is not only important
to the company and verifier, but also for externalstakeholders to be able to make informed and appro-priate decisions. Verifiers will ensure that specificexclusions have not been made solely to improve thecompanyâ€™s performance. To enhance transparency andcredibility companies should make the scope of workpublicly available.
