SCOPE 1 EMISSION SOURCES
•Stationary combustion (boilers and turbines used
in the production of electricity, heat or  steam, fuelpumps, fuel cells, flaring)
•Mobile combustion (trucks, barges and trains for
transportation of fuels)
•Fugitive emissions (CH
4leakage from transmission
and storage facilities, HFC emissions from LPG storagefacilities, SF
6emissions from transmission and distri-
bution equipment)
•Stationary combustion (process heaters, engines,
turbines, flares, incinerators, oxidizers, production ofelectricity, heat and steam)
•Process emissions (process vents, equipment vents,
maintenance/turnaround activities, non-routine activities)
•Mobile combustion (transportation of raw
materials/products/waste; company owned vehicles)
•Fugitive emissions (leaks from pressurized equipment,
wastewater treatment, surface impoundments)
•Stationary combustion (methane flaring and use, use
of explosives, mine  fires)
•Mobile combustion (mining equipment, transportation
of coal)
•Fugitive emissions (CH
4emissions from coal mines
and coal piles)
•Stationary combustion (bauxite to aluminum processing,
coke baking, lime, soda ash and fuel use, on-site CHP)
•Process emissions (carbon anode oxidation, electrol-
ysis, PFC)
•Mobile combustion (pre- and post-smelting trans-
portation, ore haulers)
•Fugitive emissions (fuel line CH4, HFC and PFC, SF6
cover gas)
•Stationary combustion (coke, coal and carbonate
fluxes, boilers, flares)
•Process emissions (crude iron oxidation, consumption of
reducing agent, carbon content of crude iron/ferroalloys)
•Mobile combustion (on-site transportation)
•Fugitive emission (CH4, N2O)
•Stationary combustion (boilers, flaring, reductive
furnaces, flame reactors, steam reformers)
•Process emissions (oxidation/reduction of substrates,
impurity removal, N2O byproducts, catalytic cracking,
myriad other emissions individual to each process)
•Mobile combustion (transportation of raw
materials/products/waste)
•Fugitive emissions (HFC use, storage tank leakage)SCOPE 2
