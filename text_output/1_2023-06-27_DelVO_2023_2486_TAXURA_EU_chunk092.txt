Substantial contribution to the transition to a circular economy
1.All generated construction and demolition waste is treated in accordance with Union waste legislation and the full
checklist of the EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol, in particular by setting sorting systems (133).
The preparing for re-use (134)or recycling (135)of the non-hazardous construction and demolition waste generated on the
construction site is at least 90 % (by mass in kilogrammes), excluding backfilling (136). This excludes naturally occurring
material referred to in category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by Decision 2000/532/EC. The
operator of the activity demonstrates compliance with the 90 % threshold by reporting on the Level(s) indicator 2.2 using
the Level 2 reporting format for different waste streams.
2.Construction designs and techniques support circularity via the incorporation of concepts for design for adaptability
and deconstruction as outlined in Level(s) indicators 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. Compliance with this requirement is
demonstrated by reporting on the Level(s) indicators 2.3 (137)and 2.4 (138)at Level 2.
3.The use of primary raw material is minimised through the use of secondary raw materials (139). For concrete, a
maximum of 70 % of the material comes from primary raw material. This criterion applies to in situ poured concrete, pre-
cast products, and all constituent materials, including any reinforcement. The threshold is calculated by subtracting the
secondary raw material from the total amount of material used measured by mass in kilogrammes. Where the information
on the recycled content of the construction product is not available, it is to be counted as comprising 100 % primary raw
material. In order to respect the Waste Hierarchy and thereby favour re-use over recycling, re-used construction products,
including those containing non-waste materials reprocessed on site, are to be counted as comprising zero primary raw
material.
4.The secondary raw materials are not moved over distances greater than 2,5 times the distance between the construction
site and the nearest production facility for equivalent primary raw materials, to avoid that the use of re-used or recycled
materials leads to higher CO 2 emissions than the use of primary raw materials.

documents/20509/).
(134)‘Preparing for re-use’ means checking, cleaning or repairing recovery operations, by which products or components of products that
have become waste are prepared so that they can be re-used without any other pre-processing. This includes, for instance, the
preparation for re-use of certain parts of buildings like roof elements, windows, doors, bricks, stones or concrete elements. A pre- requisite for the preparation for re-use of building elements is usually the selective deconstruction of buildings or other structures.
(135)‘Recycling’ means any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances whether
for the original or other purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material but does not include energy recovery and the
reprocessing into materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations.
(136)‘Backfilling’ means any recovery operation where suitable non-hazardous waste is used for purposes of reclamation in excavated areas
or for engineering purposes in landscaping. Waste used for backfilling must substitute non-waste materials, be suitable for the
aforementioned purposes, and be limited to the amount strictly necessary to achieve those purposes.
