1.1.2.2. Numerator
The numerator equals to the part of the capital expenditure included in the denominator that is any of the following:
(a) related to assets or processes that are associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities;
(b) part of a plan to expand Taxonomy-aligned economic activities or to allow Taxonomy-eligible economic activities to
become Taxonomy-aligned (‘CapEx plan’) under the conditions specified in the second subparagraph of this point
1.1.2.2;
(c) related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and individual measures enabling the
target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions, notably activities listed in points 7.3 to
7.6 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act, as well as other economic activities listed in the delegated acts adopted
pursuant to Article 10(3), Article 11(3), Article 12(2), Article 13(2), Article 14(2) and Article 15(2) of Regulation (EU)
2020/852 and provided that such measures are implemented and operational within 18 months.
The CapEx plan referred to in the first paragraph of this point 1.1.2.2 shall meet the following conditions:
(a) the plan aims either to expand the undertaking’s Taxonomy-aligned economic activities or to upgrade Taxonomy-
eligible economic activities to render them Taxonomy-aligned within a period of five years;
(b) the plan shall be disclosed at economic activity aggregated level and be approved by the management body of non-
financial undertakings either directly or by delegation.
Where the relevant technical screening criteria are amended before the completion of the CapEx plan, non-financial
undertakings shall either update the plan within two years to ensure the economic activities referred to in point (a) are
aligned with the amended technical screening criteria upon the completion of the plan or restate the numerator of the
CapEx KPI. The updating of plan shall restart the period referred to in point (a). The period referred to point (a) of the
second paragraph of this point 1.1.2.2 can exceed five years only where a longer period is objectively justified by specific
features of the economic activity and the upgrade concerned, with a maximum of 10 years. That justification shall feature
in the CapEx plan itself and in the contextual information detailed under point 1.2.3 of this Annex.
Where the CapEx plan fails to meet the conditions referred to in the second paragraph of this point 1.1.2.2, previously
published KPI related to capital expenditure shall be restated.
The numerator shall also contain the part of the CapEx for adaptation of economic activities to climate change in
accordance with Annex II to this Climate Delegated Act. The numerator shall provide for a breakdown for the part of
CapEx allocated to substantial contribution to climate change adaptation.
1.1.3. KPI related to operating expenditure (OpEx) (OpEx KPI)
The proportion of OpExreferred to in Article 8(2), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 shall be calculated as the
numerator divided by the denominator as specified in points 1.1.3.1 and 1.1.3.2 of this Annex.
1.1.3.1. Denominator
The denominator shall cover direct non-capitalised costs that relate to research and development, building renovation
measures, short-term lease, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing
of assets of property, plant and equipment by the undertaking or third party to whom activities are outsourced that are necessary to ensure the continued and effective functioning of such assets.
Non-financial undertakings that apply national GAAP and are not capitalising right-of-use assets shall include lease costs in
the OpEx in addition to the costs listed in the first subparagraph of point 1.1.3.1 of this Annex.
