3. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and
take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line
with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports (  584  ), scientific peer-reviewed 
publications and open source (  585  ) or paying models. 
4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people,
of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  586  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  587  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  The building is not dedicated to extraction, storage, transport or manu ­
facture of fossil fuels.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  Where installed as part of the renovation works, except for renovation 
works in residential building units, the specified water use for the
following water appliances is attested by product datasheets, a building
certification or an existing product label in the Union, in accordance with
the technical specifications laid down in Appendix E to Annex I to this
Regulation:
(a) wash hand basin taps and kitchen taps have a maximum water flow of
6 litres/min;
(b) showers have a maximum water flow of 8 litres/min;
(c) WCs, including suites, bowls and flushing cisterns, have a full flush
volume of a maximum of 6 litres and a maximum average flush
volume of 3,5 litres;
(d) urinals use a maximum of 2 litres/bowl/hour. Flushing urinals have a
maximum full flush volume of 1 litre.

( 586  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta n­
eously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more
diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-eff icient
and systemic interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of
ecosystem services (version of 4.6.2021: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/nature-
based-solutions_en/).
