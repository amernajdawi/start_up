7.5.  Installation, maintenance and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulation and controlling 
energy performance of buildings  
Description of the activity  
Installation, maintenance and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulation and controlling energy
performance of buildings, consisting in one of the following measures:  
(a) installation, maintenance and repair of zoned thermostats, smart thermostat systems and sensing equipment,
including motion and day light control;  
(b) installation, maintenance and repair of building automation and control systems, building energy management
systems (BEMS), lighting control systems and energy management systems (EMS);  
(c) installation, maintenance and repair of smart meters for gas, heat, cool and electricity;  
(d) installation, maintenance and repair of façade and roofing elements with a solar shading or solar control
function, including those that support the growing of vegetation.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular F42, F43, M71,
and C16, C17, C22, C23, C25, C27, C28, in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities
established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
