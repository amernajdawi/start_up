NOTES
1GHG program is a generic term used to refer to any voluntary or mandatory
international, national, sub-national government or non-governmentalauthority that registers, certifies, or regulates GHG emissions or removals.
2Throughout the rest of this document, the term “company” or “busi-ness” is used as shorthand for companies, businesses and other typesof organizations.
3For example, WRI uses the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard to publicly
report its own emissions on an annual basis and to participate in theChicago Climate Exchange.
4Trading programs that operate at the level of facilities primarily use theGHG Protocol Initiative calculation tools.
