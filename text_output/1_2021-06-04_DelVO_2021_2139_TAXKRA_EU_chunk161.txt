(5) Pollution prevention and control  As regards the reduction of sulphur oxides emissions and particulate 
matters, vessels comply with Directive (EU) 2016/802, and with Regu ­
lation 14 of Annex VI to the IMO MARPOL Convention. Sulphur in fuel
content does not exceed 0,5 % in mass (the global sulphur limit) and
0,1 % in mass in emission control area (ECA) designated in the North
and Baltic Seas by the IMO (  267  ). 
As regards nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, vessels comply with Regu ­
lation 13 of Annex VI to IMO MARPOL Convention. Tier II NO  x 
requirement applies to ships constructed after 2011. Only while
operating in NO  x emission control areas established under IMO rules, 
ships constructed after 1 January 2016 comply with stricter engine
requirements (Tier III) reducing NO  x emissions (  268  ). 
Discharges of black and grey water comply with Annex IV to the IMO
MARPOL Convention.
Measures are in place to minimise toxicity of anti-fouling paint and
biocides as laid down in Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, which implements
in Union law the International Convention on the Control of Harmful
Anti-fouling Systems on Ships adopted on 5 October 2001.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  Releases of ballast water containing non-indigenous species are prevented 
in line with the International Convention for the Control and Management
of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments (BWM).
Measures are in place to prevent the introduction of non-indigenous
species by biofouling of hull and niche areas of ships taking into
account the IMO Biofouling Guidelines (  269  ). 
Noise and vibrations are limited by using noise reducing propellers, hull
design or on-board machinery in line with the guidance given in the IMO
Guidelines for the Reduction of Underwater Noise (  270  ). 
In the Union, the activity does not hamper the achievement of good
environmental status, as set out in Directive 2008/56/EC, requiring that
the appropriate measures are taken to prevent or mitigate impacts in
relation to that Directive’s Descriptors 1 (biodiversity), 2 (non-indigenous
species), 6 (seabed integrity), 8 (contaminants), 10 (marine litter),
11 (Noise/Energy) and as set out in Decision (EU) 2017/848 in relation
to the relevant criteria and methodological standards for those descriptors,
as applicable.  
6.13.  Infrastructure for personal mobility, cycle logistics  
Description of the activity  
Construction, modernisation, maintenance and operation of infrastructure for personal mobility, including the
construction of roads, motorways bridges and tunnels and other infrastructure that are dedicated to pedestrians
and bicycles, with or without electric assist.  
___________  
( 267  ) As regards the extension of the requirements applying in Emission Control Area to other Union seas, countries bordering the 
Mediterranean Sea are discussing the creation of relevant ECA under the legal framework of the Barcelona Convention.  
( 268  ) In Union seas, the requirement is applicable as of 2021 in the Baltic and North Seas.
