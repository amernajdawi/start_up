Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  N/A  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  In case of construction of offshore wind, the activity does not hamper the 
achievement of good environmental status, as set out in Directive
2008/56/EC, requiring that the appropriate measures are taken to
prevent or mitigate impacts in relation to that Directive’s Descriptor 11
(Noise/Energy), laid down in Annex I to that Directive and as set out in
Decision (EU)2017/848 in relation to the relevant criteria and methodo ­
logical standards for that descriptor.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  The activity assesses availability of and, where feasible, uses equipment and 
components of high durability and recyclability and that are easy to
dismantle and refurbish.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  N/A  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex (  247  ). 
In case of offshore wind, the activity does not hamper the achievement of
good environmental status, as set out in Directive 2008/56/EC, requiring
that the appropriate measures are taken to prevent or mitigate impacts in
relation to that Directive’s Descriptors 1 (biodiversity) and 6 (seabed integ ­
rity), laid down in Annex I to that Directive, and as set out in Decision
(EU) 2017/848 in relation to the relevant criteria and methodological
standards for those descriptors.  
4.4.  Electricity generation from ocean energy technologies  
Description of the activity  
Construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity from ocean energy.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular D35.11 and
F42.22 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.
