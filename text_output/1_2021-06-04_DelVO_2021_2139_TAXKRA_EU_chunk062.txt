Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. Forest management plan or equivalent instrument  
1.1. The activity takes place on area that is subject to a forest management plan or an equivalent instrument, as
set out in national law or, where national law does not define a forest management plan or equivalent
instrument, as referred to in the FAO definition of ‘forest area with long-term forest management plan’ (  40 ). 
The forest management plan or equivalent instrument covers a period of 10 years or more and is
continuously updated.
1.2. Information is provided on the following points that are not already documented in the forest
management plan or equivalent system:
(a) management goals, including major constraints (  41 ); 
(b) general strategies and activities planned to reach the management goals, including expected operations over
the whole forest cycle;
(c) definition of the forest habitat context, including main existing and intended forest tree species, and their
extent and distribution;
(d) definition of the area according to its gazetting in the land registry;
(e) compartments, roads, rights of way and other public access, physical features including waterways, areas
under legal and other restrictions;
(f) measures deployed to maintain the good condition of forest ecosystems;
(g) consideration of societal issues (including preservation of landscape, consultation of stakeholders in
accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in national law);
(h) assessment of forest related risks, including forest fires, and pests and diseases outbreaks, with the aim of
preventing, reducing and controlling the risks and measures deployed to ensure protection and adaptation
against residual risks;
(i) all DNSH criteria relevant for forest management.
1.3. The sustainability of the forest management systems, as documented in the plan referred to in point 1.1,
is ensured by choosing the most ambitious of the following approaches:
(a) the forest management matches the applicable national definition of sustainable forest management;
(b) the forest management matches the Forest Europe definition (  42 ) of sustainable forest management, and 
complies with the Pan-European Operational Level Guidelines for Sustainable Forest Management (  43 );
