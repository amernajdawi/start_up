what is owned/controlled by the companyin the target completion year.
Emissions are recalculated for all years
back to the fixed target base year
If a company with a target acquires a
company that did not have reliable GHGdata in the target base year; back-casting of emissions becomes necessary,reducing the reliability of the base year ROLLING TARGET BASE YEAR
A target might take the form of “over the next Xyears we will reduce emissions every year by Y%compared to the previous year”
5
The previous year
If there have been significant structural changes the
time series of absolute emissions will not comparelike with like over more than two years at a time
The comparison over time is based on what was
owned/controlled by the company in the years theinformation was reported
6
Emissions are recalculated only for the year prior to the structural change, or ex-post for the year of the structural change which then becomes thebase year.
Data from an acquired company’s GHG emissions
are only necessary for the year before the acquisi-tion (or even only from the acquisition onwards),reducing or eliminating the need for back-casting
The circumstances which trigger recalculations for structural changes etc. (see chapter 5) are
the same under both approaches
