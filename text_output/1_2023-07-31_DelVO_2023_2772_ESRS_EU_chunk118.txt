ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 119/284AR 15. Where relevant to achieve its pollution
-related policy objectives and targets, the undertaking may provide
information on site-level action plans.
Metrics and targets
Disclosure Requirement E2-3 – Targets related to pollution
AR 16. If the undertaking refers to ecological thresholds when setting targets, it may refer to the guidance provided by the
Science-Based Targets Initiative for Nature (SBTN) in its interim guidance (Initial Guidance for Business, September
2020), or any other guidance with a scientifically acknowledged methodology that allows setting of science-based
targets by identifying ecological thresholds and, if applicable, entity-specific allocations. Ecological thresholds can
be local, national and/or global.
AR 17. The undertaking may specify whether the target addresses shortcomings related to the Substantial Contribution
criteria for Pollution Prevention and Control as defined in delegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 14(2) of
Regulation (EU) 2020/852. Where the Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria for Pollution Prevention and
Control as defined in delegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 10(3), Article 11(3), Article 12(2), Article 13(2), and Article 15(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 are not met, the undertaking may specify whether the target
addresses shortcomings related those DNSH critera.
AR 18. Where relevant to support the policies it has adopted, the undertaking may provide information on the targets set
at site level.
AR 19. The targets may cover the undertaking’s own operations and/or the value chain.
Disclosure Requirement E2-4 – Pollution of air, water and soil
AR 20. The information to be provided on microplastics under paragraph 28(b) shall include microplastics that have been
generated or used during production processes or that are procured, and that leave the undertaking’s facilities as
emissions, as products, or as part of products or services. Microplastics may be unintentionally produced when
larger pieces of plastics like car tires or synthetic textiles wear and tear or may be deliberately manufactured and
added to products for specific purposes (e.g., exfoliating beads in facial or body scrubs).
AR 21. The volume of pollutants shall be presented in appropriate mass units, for example tonnes or kilogrammes.
AR 22. The information required under this Disclosure Requirement shall be provided at the level of the reporting
undertaking. However, the undertaking may disclose additional breakdown including information at site level or a
breakdown of its emissions by type of source, by sector or by geographical area.
AR 23. When providing contextual information on the emissions, the undertaking may consider:
(a) the local air quality indices (AQI) for the area where the undertaking’s air pollution occurs;
(b) the degree of urbanisation (DEGURBA) (
59)for the area where air pollution occurs; and
(c) the undertaking’s percentage of the total emissions of pollutants to water and soil occurring in areas at water
risk, including areas of high-water stress.
(59)According to Eurostat, the Degree of urbanisation (DEGURBA) is a classification that indicates the character of an area. Based on the
share of local population living in urban clusters and in urban centres, it classifies Local Administrative Units (LAU or communes)
into three types of area: i) Cities (densely populated areas), ii) Towns and suburbs (intermediate density areas), and iii) Rural areas
(thinly populated areas).OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
