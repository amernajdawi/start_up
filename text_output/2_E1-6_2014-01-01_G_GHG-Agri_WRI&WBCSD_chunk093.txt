Case C: Purchase of land unde rgoing changes in C stocks
Same as Case A, but the land is acquired by the reporting company (a t year 28) after its
conversion into pasture (Figure II-2). The reporting company amortizes the CO 2 fluxes from this
conversion over a 20 year period (ending year 25), but does not include all of these fluxes in its
inventories. Instead, it only revises its inventories to report the CO 2 fluxes that occurred during
years 20–25. This is because year 20 was established as its base pe riod. Table II-4 describes how
the changes in C stocks are amor tized by the reporting company.

because of a shift in land use made by a prior owner (Case C)

Appendix III: Tools for calculating agricultural GHG fluxes

Overview
This Appendix lists some of the most widely used  tools (spreadsheets, so ftware and protocols) 
for calculating GHG fluxes in agriculture. Thr ee broad classes of tools are covered:
 Tools suitable for farm managers. These are ge nerally web- or Excel-based calculators that
can be used with commonly available types of activity data. They tend to implement a
variety of the calculation appr oaches described in Table 7- 1; namely, emission factors,
empirical or process models, or some combination of these approaches.
 General catalogues of calculation methodologi es. These describe formulae and default
emission factors that can be used to calculate flux data for an extens ive range of emissions
sources. They do not provide an interface for performing calculations.
 Tools suitable for academic use. These are primarily process-based models intended for
academic research. They have extensive requirements in terms of data inputs, labor and expertise, and would not be recommended fo r use by farm managers. They are described
here because they underpin many of  the more accessible resources.
