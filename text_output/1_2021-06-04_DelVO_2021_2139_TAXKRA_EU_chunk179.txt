The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code J63.11 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is a transitional activity as referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU)
2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. The activity has implemented all relevant practices listed as ‘expected practices’ in the most recent version
of the European Code of Conduct on Data Centre Energy Efficiency (  307  ), or in CEN-CENELEC document CLC 
TR50600-99-1 ‘Data centre facilities and infrastructures - Part 99-1: Recommended practices for energy manage ­
ment’ (  308  ). 
The implementation of those practices is verified by an independent third-party and audited at least every three
years.
2. Where an expected practice is not considered relevant due to physical, logistical, planning or other
constraints, an explanation of why the expected practice is not applicable or practical is provided. Alternative
best practices from the European Code of Conduct on Data Centre Energy Efficiency or other equivalent sources
may be identified as direct replacements if they result in similar energy savings.
3. The global warming potential (GWP) of refrigerants used in the data centre cooling system does not exceed
675.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  The equipment used meets the requirements laid down in Directive 
2009/125/EC for servers and data storage products.
The equipment used does not contain the restricted substances listed in
Annex II to Directive 2011/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the
Council (  309  ), except where the concentration values by weight in homo ­
geneous materials do not exceed the maximum values listed in that Annex.
A waste management plan is in place and ensures maximal recycling at
end of life of electrical and electronic equipment, including through
contractual agreements with recycling partners, reflection in financial
projections or official project documentation.
