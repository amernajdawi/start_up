(5) Pollution prevention and control  Measures are taken to reduce noise, vibration, dust and pollutant emissions 
during construction maintenance works.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
7.  CONSTRUCTION AND REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES  
7.1.  Construction of new buildings  
Description of the activity  
Development of building projects for residential and non-residential buildings by bringing together financial,
technical and physical means to realise the building projects for later sale as well as the construction of
complete residential or non-residential buildings, on own account for sale or on a fee or contract basis.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular F41.1 and
F41.2, including also activities under F43, in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities
established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
Constructions of new buildings for which:
1. The Primary Energy Demand (PED) (  281  ), defining the energy performance of the building resulting from the 
construction, is at least 10 % lower than the threshold set for the nearly zero-energy building (NZEB)
requirements in national measures implementing Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of
the Council (  282  ). The energy performance is certified using an as built Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). 
2. For buildings larger than 5 000 m  2 ( 283  ), upon completion, the building resulting from the construction 
undergoes testing for air-tightness and thermal integrity (  284  ), and any deviation in the levels of performance 
set at the design stage or defects in the building envelope are disclosed to investors and clients. As an
alternative; where robust and traceable quality control processes are in place during the construction
process this is acceptable as an alternative to thermal integrity testing.
3. For buildings larger than 5 000 m  2 ( 285  ), the life-cycle Global Warming Potential (GWP) (  286  ) of the building 
resulting from the construction has been calculated for each stage in the life cycle and is disclosed to investors
and clients on demand.  
_____________
( 281  ) The calculated amount of energy needed to meet the energy demand associated with the typical uses of a building expressed by a 
numeric indicator of total primary energy use in kWh/m  2 per year and based on the relevant national calculation methodology 
and as displayed on the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC).
( 282  ) Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings 
(OJ L 153, 18.6.2010, p. 13).
( 283  ) For residential buildings, the testing is made for a representative set of dwelling/apartment types. 
( 284  ) The testing is carried out in accordance with EN13187 (Thermal Performance of Buildings - Qualitative Detection of Thermal 
Irregularities in Building Envelopes - Infrared Method) and EN 13829 (Thermal performance of buildings. Determination of air
permeability of buildings. Fan pressurisation method) or equivalent standards accepted by the respective building control body
where the building is located.
( 285  ) For residential buildings, the calculation and disclosure are made for a representative set of dwelling/apartment types. 
( 286  ) The GWP is communicated as a numeric indicator for each life cycle stage expressed as kgCO  2 e/m  2 (of useful internal floor area) 
averaged for one year of a reference study period of 50 years. The data selection, scenario definition and calculations are car ried
out in accordance with EN 15978 (BS EN 15978:2011. Sustainability of construction works. Assessment of environmental
performance of buildings. Calculation method). The scope of building elements and technical equipment is as defined in the
Level(s) common EU framework for indicator 1.2. Where a national calculation tool exists, or is required for making disclosures  
or for obtaining building permits, the respective tool may be used to provide the required disclosure. Other calculation tools may
