ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 35/1642.4.3. The activity provides tracking information on substances identified as substance of very high concern (SVHC) and
for substances meeting the criteria for substance of very high concern (SVHC), by complying with at least one of the two
disclosure frameworks listed below:
(a) product information on substances is available publicly, in SCIP database (31)for products that contain > 0,1 % (w/w) of
an identified substance of very high concern or in a specific public tool provided by company;
(b) product information on substances is available publicly, following IEC62474 (32)(for electrical and electronic
equipment) and future IEC82474-1 (33)(dual logo project).
2.5. Design for recyclability
The economic activity manufactures products with demonstrated superior recyclability. Assessment of recyclability relies
on EN 45555:2019 (34)or on any product-specific EN standard relying on EN 45555:2019. The economic activity
complies with the following requirements:
(a) single polymer or recyclable polymer blends are used;
(b) plastic enclosures do not contain moulded-in or glue-on metal;
(c) materials which cannot be recycled together are easy to access and have the ability to be separated;
(d) improving recyclability does not harm the durability of the system itself;
(e) parts of the product containing substances, mixtures and components that are to be removed during depollution are
easy to identify, such as through marking for sorting provided by the manufacturer, and visible on the product;
(f) printed circuit boards, hard disc drives (HDDs), electric motors, permanent magnets, batteries, fluorescent powders, or
any other components identified in Union legislation to be of high critical raw materials recovery potential are easy to
access and to remove from the product;
(g) parts that reduce the recyclability according to the reference scenario for the end-of-life treatment of products, such as
plastic using certain fillers or certain flame retardants, are easy to access and remove;
(h) joining, fastening or sealing techniques do not prevent the safe and readily achievable removal of the components
specified in Directive 2012/19/EU or in Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 of the European Parliament and of the Council
on batteries and waste batteries (35), where present.
2.6. Proactive substitution of hazardous substances
2.6.1. The economic activity manufactures products which demonstrate proactive substitution of hazardous substances.
2.6.2. The product does not contain substances of very high concern included in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC)
No 1907/2006.
2.6.3. Exemptions to Restrictions of Hazardous Substances are limited to the following cases:
(a) lead in high melting temperature type solders covered by the exemption entry 7(a) in Annex III to Directive
2011/65/EU;
(b) electrical and electronic components containing lead in a glass or ceramic covered by the exemption entries under 7(c)
in Annex III to Directive 2011/65/EU.
