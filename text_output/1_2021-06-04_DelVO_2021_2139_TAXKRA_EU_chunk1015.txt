(b) favour nature-based solutions (  610  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  611  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)

Description of the activity  
Buying real estate and exercising ownership of that real estate.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code L68 in accordance with the statistical
classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
