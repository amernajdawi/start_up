A stabilization target is one that aims to keep emissions constant over time. In this example, company A acquires company B, wh ich has
experienced organic GHG growth since the target base year (or “starting” year). Under the rolling approach, emissions growth in  the
acquired company (B) from year 1 to year 2 does not appear as an emissions increase in relation to the target of the acquiring company
(A). Thus company A would meet its stabilization target when using the rolling approach but not when using the fixed approach. In parallel
to the example in chapter 5, past GHG growth or decline in divested facilities (GHG changes before the divestment) would affect  the target
performance under the rolling approach, while it would not be counted under the fixed approach.
commitment period). In other words, its average
emissions over those five years must not exceed 90 percent of year 2000 emissions.
Target commitment periods longer than one year can
be used to mitigate the risk of unpredictable events inone particular year influencing performance againstthe target. Figure 15 shows that the length of thetarget commitment period determines how many emis-sions are actually relevant for target performance.
For a target using a rolling base year, the commitment
period applies throughout: emission performance iscontinuously being measured against the target everyyear from when the target is set until the targetcompletion date.
7. Decide on the use of GHG offsets or credits8
A GHG target can be met entirely from internal reduc-tions at sources included in the target boundary orthrough additionally using offsets that are generatedfrom GHG reduction projects that reduce emissions atsources (or enhance sinks) external to the targetboundary.
9The use of offsets may be appropriate when FIGURE 15. Short vs. long commitment periods
