(23) Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (17)applies to under takings whose secur ities
are admitted to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union. In order to ensure that under takings whose secur ities
are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union, including third-countr y issuers, fall under the same
sustainability repor ting requirements, Directive 2004/109/EC should contain the necessar y cross-ref erences to any
requirement on sustainability repor ting in the annual financial repor t.
(24) Point (i) of the first subparagraph of Article 23(4) and the fourth subparagraph of Article 23(4) of Directive
2004/109/EC empo wer the Commission to adop t measures to set up a mechanism for the determination of
equivalence of information required under that Directive, and for the establishment of general equivalence criteria
regarding accounting standards, respectively . The third subparagraph of Article 23(4) of Directive 2004/109/EC
also empo wers the Commission to take the necessar y decisions on the equivalence of accounting standards whic h
are used by third-countr y issuers. In order to reflect the inclusion of the sustainability requirements in Directive
2004/109/EC, the Commission should be empowered to establish a mec hanism for the deter mination of
equivalence of sustainability repor ting standards applied by third-countr y issuers, similar to what is provided for in
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1569/2007 (18)whic h sets out the criteria for the determination of equivalence of
accounting standards applied by third-countr y issuers. For the same reason, the Commission should also be
empo wered to take the necessar y decisions on the equivalence of sustainability repor ting standards that are used by
third-countr y issuers. The amendments introduced by this amending Directive will ensure consistent equivalence
regimes for sustainability repor ting requirements and for financial repor ting requirements regar ding the annual
financial repor t.
(25) Article 19a(3) and Article 29a(3) of Directive 2013/34/EU exem pt all subsidiar y under takings from the obligation to
repor t non-fi nancial information where such under takings and their subsidiar y under takings are included in the
consolidated manag ement repor t of their parent under taking, provid ed that repor t includes non-fi nancial
information repor ted pursuant to that Directive. It is necessar y, however , to ensure that sustainability information is
easily accessible for users, and to ensure that there is transparency as regar ds which parent under taking of the
exem pted subsidiar y under taking is repor ting at group level. It is theref ore necessar y to require those subsidiar y
under takings to include in their managemen t repor t the name and register ed office of the parent under taking that is
repor ting sustainability information at group level, the weblink s to the consolidated manage ment repor t of their
parent under taking and a reference in their manag ement repor t to the fact that they are exem pted from
sustainability repor ting. Member States should be able to require that the parent under taking publish the
consolidated manag ement repor t in the languag es they accept and that the parent under taking provid e any
necessar y translation in such language s. Such exem ption should also apply where the parent under taking repor ting
at group level is a third-countr y under taking repor ting sustainability information in accordance with equivalent
sustainability repor ting standards.
Directive 2004/109/EC, as amended by this amending Directive, should provide for appropr iate mec hanisms to
determine the equivalence of sustainability repor ting standards, and under takings whose secur ities are admitted to
trading on a regulated mark et in the Union and under takings whose secur ities are not admitted to trading on a
regulated mark et in the Union should be required to repor t in accordance with the same sustainability repor ting
standards. In this context, the implementing acts adopt ed by the Commission pursuant to point (i) of the first
subparagraph of Article 23(4) and the fourth subparagraph of Article 23(4) of Directive 2004/109/EC establishing
