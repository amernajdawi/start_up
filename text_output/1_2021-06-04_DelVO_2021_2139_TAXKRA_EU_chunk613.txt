3. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and
take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line
with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports (  271  ), scientific peer-reviewed 
publications and open source (  272  ) or paying models. 
4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people,
of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  273  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  274  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change mitigation  The activity meets the requirements relating to sustainability, greenhouse 
gas emission savings and efficiency laid down in Article 29 of Directive
2018/2001.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  For installations falling within the scope of Directive 2010/75/EU of the 
European Parliament and of the Council (  275  ), emissions are within or 
lower than the emission levels associated with the best available techniques
(BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the latest relevant best available techniques
(BAT) conclusions, including the best available techniques (BAT)
conclusions for large combustion plants (  276  ). No significant cross-media 
effects occur.
