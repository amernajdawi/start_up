Agricultural production frequently  results in the generation of  by-products or co-products, 
especially if farms have on-site product processing  facilities. In additi on, certain agricultural 
activities will contribute to multiple streams of products (and their co/by-products), especially on
mixed farms (Figure I-1). For instance, fertiliz er application will support not only crop growth,
but also livestock production, if so me of the primary output (the cr op) is used as livestock feed.  
Allocation  is the process of partit ioning GHG flux data from a fa rm to the different product 
streams from that farm. Allocation may be needed  when computing intensity ratios for individual 
products. Allocation may also be needed when:
‐ Reporting GHG data to customers that are acc ounting for their scope 3 emissions and that
therefore only require information on the specific GHG fluxe s attributable to the products
they purchased.

‐ Allocating GHG fluxes between scope 1 and scope 3.
Allocations will not be necessary wh en a farm produces only one output. They should not be
done to calculate the GHG fluxes that a re to be reported in a corporate inventory , except to
allocate between scope 1 and scope  3. Also, this Guidance is not concerned with allocations for 
product-level GHG accounting – for guidance on th is topic, see the GHG Protocol Product
Standard, sectoral life cycl e accounting guidance, or produc t category rules.       
Should allocations be performed, note that co-p roducts without economic value are considered
wastes and should have no GHG fl uxes allocated to them. Also, if GHG fluxes are allocated,
they should sum to the total flux initially calculated.
