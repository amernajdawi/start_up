1.  FORESTRY  
1.1.  Afforestation  
Description of the activity  
Establishment of forest through planting, deliberate seeding or natural regeneration on land that, until then, was
under a different land use or not used. Afforestation implies a transformation of land use from non-forest to forest,
in accordance with the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (‘FAO’) definition of affores ­
tation (  1 ), where forest means a land matching the forest definition as set out in national law, or where not 
available, is in accordance with the FAO definition of forest (  2 ). Afforestation may cover past afforestation as long 
as it takes place in the period between the planting of the trees and the time when the land use is recognised as a
forest.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code A2 in accordance with the statistical
classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006. Activities are limited to NACE II
02.10, i.e. silviculture and other forestry activities, 02.20, i.e. logging, 02.30, i.e. gathering of wild growing non-
wood products and 02.40, i.e. support services to forestry.  
Where an economic activity in this category complies with the substantial contribution criterion specified in
point 5, the activity is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU)
2020/852, provided that it meets the technical screening criteria set out in this section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.
The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan,
such that:
(a) for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using
climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale;
(b) for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state of-the-art
climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios (  3 ) consistent with the expected lifetime of the 
activity, including, at least, 10 to 30 years climate projections scenarios for major investments.
