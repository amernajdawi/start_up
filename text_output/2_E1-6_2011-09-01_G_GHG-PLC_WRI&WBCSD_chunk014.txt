Chapter Requirements
13.  Reporting  
(continued)Inventory Results
• The source and date of the GWP factors used
• Total inventory results in units of CO2e per unit of analysis, which includes  
all emissions and removals included in the boundary from biogenic sources,  
non-biogenic sources, and land-use change impacts
• Percentage of total inventory results by life cycle stage
• Biogenic and non-biogenic emissions and removals separately, when applicable
• Land use impacts separately, when applicable
• Cradle-to-gate and gate-to-gate inventory results separately (or a clear statement
that confidentiality is a limitation to providing this information)
• The amount of carbon contained in the product or its components that is not
released to the atmosphere during waste treatment, when applicable
• For cradle-to-gate inventories, the amount of carbon contained in the
intermediate product
Assurance
• The assurance statement including:
•Whether the assurance was performed by a first or third party
•Level of assurance achieved (limited or reasonable) and assurance opinion or
the critical review findings
•A summary of the assurance process
•The relevant competencies of the assurance providers
•How any potential conflicts of interests were avoided for first party assurance
Setting Reduction Targets and Tracking Inventory Changes
• Companies that report a reduction target and/or track performance over time
shall include the following:
•The base inventory and current inventory results in the updated inventory report
•The reduction target, if established
•Changes made to the inventory, if the base inventory was recalculated
•The threshold used to determine when recalculation is needed
 •Appropriate context identifying and describing any significant changes  
that trigger base inventory recalculation
•The change in inventory results as a percentage change over time between
two inventories on the unit of analysis basis
•An explanation of the steps taken to reduce emissions based on the
inventory results
14.  Setting Reduction 
Targets and  
Tracking Inventory
Changes Over TimeNote: Setting a reduction target and tracking inventory changes over time is not
required to claim conformance with the Product Standard. However, if companies
choose to set a reduction target, the following requirements apply.
To set reduction targets and track inventory changes over time, companies shall:
• Develop and report a base inventory that conforms with the requirements of this
standard
• Recalculate the base inventory when significant changes in the inventory
methodology occur and report those changes
• Complete and disclose an updated inventory report including the updated results,
the base inventory results, and the context for significant changes
• Use a consistent unit of analysis to enable comparison and track performance
over timeCHAPTER 03 Summary of Steps and Requirements
