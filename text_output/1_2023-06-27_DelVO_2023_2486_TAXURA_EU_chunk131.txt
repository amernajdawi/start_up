ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 93/164The activity implements best practices specified in the Joint Research Centre Best
Environmental Management Practice for the Public Administration Sector (18).
Where waste water treatment is conducted by an urban waste water treatment plant on
behalf of the manufacturing plant, it is ensured that:
(a) the load of pollutants released by the manufacturing plant has no negative effect in
the treatment process of the urban waste water treatment plant;
(b) the load and characteristics of pollutants do not pose any risk or harm to the health
of the staff working in waste water treatment plants;
(c) the urban waste water treatment plant is designed and equipped appropriately to
abate the released polluting substances;
(d) the overall load of the concerned pollutants discharged to the water body is not increased compared to the situation where the emissions from the installation
concerned remained compliant with emission limit values set for direct releases;
(e) the usability of the sewage sludge for nutrient (re)cycling is not affected.
For installations where additional pollutant limits or stricter conditions have been
included in their environmental permit compared to the requirements of the legislation
mentioned above, these stricter conditions apply.
2. Soil and groundwater protection
Appropriate measures are in place to prevent emissions to soil and regular surveillance is
conducted to avoid leaks, spills, incidents or accidents occurring during the use of
equipment and during storage.
3. Water consumption
Operators assess the water footprint of the chemical production processes in line with
ISO 14046:2014 (
19)and ensure that they do not contribute to water scarcity. Based on
this assessment, operators provide a declaration that they do not contribute to water scarcity which is verified by an independent third party.
4. The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.
(4) Transition to a circular
economyThe activity assesses the availability of and, where feasible, adopts techniques that support:
(a) reuse and use of secondary raw materials and reused components in products
manufactured;
(b) design for high durability, recyclability, easy disassembly and adaptability of
products manufactured;
