(4) Transition to a circular economy  Vehicles of category N1, N2 and N3 are both of the following: 
(a) reusable or recyclable to a minimum of 85 % by weight;
(b) reusable or recoverable to a minimum of 95 % by weight (  243  ). 
Measures are in place to manage waste both in the use phase (main ­
tenance) and the end-of-life of the fleet, including through reuse and
recycling of batteries and electronics (in particular critical raw materials
therein), in accordance with the waste hierarchy.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  For road vehicles of categories M and N, tyres comply with external rolling 
noise requirements in the highest populated class and with Rolling
Resistance Coefficient (influencing the vehicle energy efficiency) in the
two highest populated classes as set out in Regulation (EU) 2020/740
and as can be verified from the European Product Registry for Energy
Labelling (EPREL). Vehicles comply with the requirements of the most
recent applicable stage of the Euro VI heavy duty emission type-appro ­
val (  244  ) set out in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 595/2009. 
Vehicles comply with Regulation (EU) No 540/2014.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  N/A  
6.7.  Inland passenger water transport  
Description of the activity  
Purchase, financing, leasing, rental and operation of passenger vessels on inland waters, involving vessels that are
not suitable for sea transport.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code H50.30 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Where an economic activity in this category does not fulfil the substantial contribution criterion specified in
point (a) of this Section, the activity is a transitional activity as referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU)
2020/852, provided it complies with the remaining technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The activity complies with one of the following criteria:
(a) the vessels have zero direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emissions; 
(b) until 31 December 2025, hybrid and dual fuel vessels derive at least 50 % of their energy from zero direct
(tailpipe) CO  2 emission fuels or plug-in power for their normal operation.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.
