(5) Pollution prevention and control  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix C to this 
Annex.
Emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the relevant best
available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including:
(a) the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for the production of
chlor-alkali (  121  ) and the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions 
for common waste water and waste gas treatment/management
systems in the chemical sector (  122  ); 
(b) the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for the refining of
mineral oil and gas (  123  ). 
No significant cross-media effects occur.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
3.11.  Manufacture of carbon black  
Description of the activity  
Manufacture of carbon black.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code C20.13 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is a transitional activity as referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU)
2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
GHG emissions (  124  ) from the carbon black production processes are lower than 1,141 (  125  ) tCO  2 e per tonne of 
product.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.
