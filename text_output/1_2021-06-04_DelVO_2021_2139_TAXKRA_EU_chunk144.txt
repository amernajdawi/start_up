Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. Characterisation and assessment of the potential storage complex and surrounding area, or exploration
within the meaning of Article 3, point (8), of Directive 2009/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council (  224  ) is carried out in order to establish whether the geological formation is suitable for use as a CO  2 
storage site.
2. For operation of underground geological CO  2 storage sites, including closure and post-closure obligations: 
(a) appropriate leakage detection systems are implemented to prevent release during operation;
(b) a monitoring plan of the injection facilities, the storage complex, and, where appropriate, the surrounding
environment is in place, with the regular reports checked by the competent national authority.
3. For the exploration and operation of storage sites within the Union, the activity complies with Directive
2009/31/EC. For the exploration and operation of storage sites in third countries, the activity complies with
ISO 27914:2017 (  225  ) for geological storage of CO  2 . 
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The activity complies with Directive 2009/31/EC.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
6.  TRANSPORT  
6.1.  Passenger interurban rail transport  
Description of the activity  
Purchase, financing, rental, leasing and operation of passenger transport using railway rolling stock on mainline
networks, spread over an extensive geographic area, passenger transport by interurban railways and operation of
sleeping cars or dining cars as an integrated operation of railway companies.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular H49.10,
N77.39 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Where an economic activity in this category does not fulfil the substantial contribution criterion specified in
point (a) of this Section, that activity is a transitional activity as referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU)
2020/852, provided it complies with the remaining technical screening criteria set out in this Section.
