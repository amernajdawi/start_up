Prepar ing early for such impa cts is cost-effective and can also bring considerable co-benef its for ecosystems , health
and the econom y. Nature-based solutions, in particular , can benefit climat e change mitigation, adap tation and
biodiversity protection.
(33) The relevant programmes established under the Multiannual Financial Framework provide for the screening of
projects to ensure that such projects are resilient to the poten tial adverse impact s of climate change through a
climat e vulnerability and risk assessment, including through relevant adap tation measures, and that they integrat e
the costs of greenhouse gas emissions and the positive effects of climat e mitig ation measures in the cost-benefi t
analysis. This contr ibut es to the integration of climat e change-relat ed risks as well as climate chang e vulnerability
and adap tation assessments into investment and planning decisions under the Union budget.
(34) In taking the relevant measures at Union and national level to achi eve the climat e-neutrality objective, Member States
and the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should, inter alia, take into account: the contr ibution
of the transition to climate neutrality to public health, the quality of the environment, the well-being of citizens, the
prosper ity of society , emplo yment and the competitiveness of the econom y; the energy transition, strengthened
energy secur ity and the tackling of energy poverty; food secur ity and affordability ; the development of sustainable
and smar t mobility and transpor t systems; fairn ess and solidar ity across and within Member States, in light of their
economic capability , national circumstances, such as the specifi cities of islands, and the need for converg ence over
time; the need to make the transition just and socially fair through appropr iate education and training programmes;
best available and most recent scientifi c evidence, in particular the findings repor ted by the IPCC; the need to
integrat e climate change relat ed risks into investment and planning decisions; cost-effe ctiveness and technological
neutrality in achi eving greenhouse gas emission reductions and remo vals and increasing resilience; and progression
over time in environmental integrity and level of ambition.
(35) As indicated in the European Green Deal, the Commission adopt ed on 9 December 2020 a communication entitled
‘Sustainable and Smar t Mobility Strategy – putting European transpor t on track for the future’. The strateg y sets out a
roadmap for a sustainable and smar t future for European transpor t, with an action plan towards an objective to
deliver a 90 % reduction in emissions from the transpor t sector by 2050.
(36) To ensure that the Union and the Member State s remain on track to achieve the climate-neutrality objective and
progress on adap tation, the Commission should regularly assess progress, building upon information as set out in
this Regulation, including information submitte d and repor ted under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. In order to allow
for a timely preparation for the global stoc ktake refer red to in Article 14 of the Paris Agreement, the conclusions of
this assessment should be published by 30 September ever y five years, starting in 2023. This implies that the repor ts
under Article 29(5) and Article 35 of that Regulation and, in the applicable years, the relat ed repor ts under Article
29(1) and Article 32 of that Regulation should be submitted to the European Parliament and to the Council at the
same time as the conclusions of that assessment. In the event that the collective progress made by Member States
towards the achi evement of the climat e-neutrality objective or on adapta tion is insuffic ient or that Union measures
are inconsiste nt with the climat e-neutrality objective or inadequate to enhance adap tive capacity , strengthen
resilience or reduce vulnerability , the Commission should take the necessar y measures in accordance with the
Treaties. The Commission should also regularly assess relevant national measures, and issue recommendations
where it finds that a Member State’s measures are inconsistent with the climat e-neutrality objective or inadequat e to
enhance adap tive capacity , strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climat e chang e.
