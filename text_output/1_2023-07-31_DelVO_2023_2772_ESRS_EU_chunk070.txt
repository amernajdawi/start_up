ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 74/2845. Climate change adaptation relates to the undertaking’s process of adjustment to actual and expected climate change.
6. This Standard covers Disclosure Requirements regarding climate-related hazards that can lead to physical climate
risks for the undertaking and its adaptation solutions to reduce these risks. It also covers transition risks arising
from the needed adaptation to climate- related hazards.
7. The Disclosure Requirements related to “Energy” cover all types of energy production and consumption.
Interactions with other ESRS
8. Ozone-depleting substances (ODS), nitrogen oxides (NOX) and sulphur oxides (SOX), among other air emissions, are
connected to climate change but are covered under the reporting requirements in ESRS E2.
9. Impacts on people that may arise from the transition to a climate-neutral economy are covered under the ESRS S1
Own workforce, ESRS S2 Workers in the value chain, ESRS S3 Affected communities and ESRS S4 Consumers and
end-users.
10. Climate change mitigation and adaptation are closely related to topics addressed in particular in ESRS E3 Water and
marine resources and ESRS E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems. With regard to water and as illustrated in the table of climate-
related hazards in AR 11, this standard addresses acute and chronic physical risks which arise from the water and
ocean-related hazards. Biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation that may be caused by climate change are
addressed in ESRS E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems.
11. This Standard should be read and applied in conjunction with ESRS 1 General requirements and ESRS 2 General
disclosures.
Disclosure Requirements
ESRS 2 General disclosures
12. The requirements of this section should be read and applied in conjunction with the disclosures required by ESRS 2
on Chapter 2 Governance, Chapter 3 Strategy and Chapter 4 Impact, risk and opportunity management. The resulting
disclosures shall be presented in the sustainability statement alongside the disclosures required by ESRS 2, except
for ESRS 2 SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model, for which
the undertaking may, in accordance with ESRS2 paragraph 46, present the disclosures alongside the other disclosures
required in this topical standard.
Governance
Disclosure requirement related to ESRS 2 GOV-3 Integration of sustainability-related performance in incentive schemes
13. The undertaking shall disclose whether and how climate-related considerations are factored into the remuneration of
members of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies, including if their performance has been
assessed against the GHG emission reduction targets reported under Disclosure Requirement E1-4 and the
percentage of the remuneration recognised in the current period that is linked to climate related considerations, with an explanation of what the climate considerations are.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
