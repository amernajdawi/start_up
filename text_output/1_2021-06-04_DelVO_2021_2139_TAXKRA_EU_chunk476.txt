(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  N/A  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  The activity assesses the availability of and, where feasible, adopts tech ­
niques that support:
(a) reuse and use of secondary raw materials and reused components in
products manufactured;
(b) design for high durability, recyclability, easy disassembly and adapta ­
bility of products manufactured;
(c) waste management that prioritises recycling over disposal, in the
manufacturing process;
(d) information on and traceability of substances of concern throughout
the life cycle of the manufactured products  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix C to this 
Annex.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
3.2.  Manufacture of equipment for the production and use of hydrogen  
Description of the activity  
Manufacture of equipment for the production and use of hydrogen, where the hydrogen for the production of
which equipment is manufactured complies with the life cycle GHG emissions savings requirement of 73,4 %
[resulting in life-cycle GHG emissions lower than 3 tCO  2 e/tH2] and of 70 % for hydrogen-based synthetic fuels 
relative to a fossil fuel comparator of 94 g CO  2 e/MJ in analogy to the approach set out in Article 25(2) of and 
Annex V to Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular C25, C27, C28,
in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
