Reported information shall be “relevant, complete,
consistent, transparent and accurate.” The GHG Protocol
Corporate Standard requires reporting a minimum of
scope 1 and scope 2 emissions.
Required information
A public GHG emissions report that is in accordancewith the
GHG Protocol Corporate Standard shall include
the following information:
DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AND INVENTORY BOUNDARY
An outline of the organizational boundaries chosen,
including the chosen consolidation approach.
An outline of the operational boundaries chosen, and if
scope 3 is included, a list specifying which types ofactivities are covered.
The reporting period covered.
INFORMATION ON EMISSIONS
Total scope 1 and 2 emissions independent of any
GHG trades such as sales, purchases, transfers, orbanking of allowances.
Emissions data separately for each scope.
Emissions data for all six GHGs separately (CO
2, CH4,
N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6) in metric tonnes and in tonnes
of CO2equivalent.
Year chosen as base year, and an emissions profile over
time that is consistent with and clarifies the chosenpolicy for making base year emissions recalculations.
Appropriate context for any significant emissions
changes that trigger base year emissions recalculation(acquisitions/divestitures, outsourcing/insourcing,changes in reporting boundaries or calculationmethodologies, etc.).
Emissions data for direct CO
2emissions from biologi-
cally sequestered carbon (e.g., CO2from burning
biomass/biofuels), reported separately from the scopes.
Methodologies used to calculate or measure emissions,
providing a reference or link to any calculation tools used.
Any specific exclusions of sources, facilities,
and / or operations.Optional information
A public GHG emissions report should include, whenapplicable, the following additional information:
INFORMATION ON EMISSIONS AND PERFORMANCE
Emissions data from relevant scope 3 emissions activi-
ties for which reliable data can be obtained.
Emissions data further subdivided, where this aids
transparency, by business units/facilities, country,source types (stationary combustion, process, fugitive,etc.), and activity types (production of electricity,transportation, generation of purchased electricitythat is sold to end users, etc.).
Emissions attributable to own generation of elec-
tricity, heat, or steam that is sold or transferred toanother organization (see chapter 4).
Emissions attributable to the generation of electricity,
heat or steam that is purchased for re-sale to non-endusers (see chapter 4).
A description of performance measured against
internal and external benchmarks.
Emissions from GHGs not covered by the Kyoto
Protocol (e.g., CFCs, NO
x,), reported separately
from scopes.
Relevant ratio performance indicators (e.g. emissions
per kilowatt-hour generated, tonne of materialproduction, or sales).
An outline of any GHG management/reduction
programs or strategies.
Information on any contractual provisions addressing
GHG-related risks and obligations.
An outline of any external assurance provided and a
copy of any verification statement, if applicable, of thereported emissions data.CHAPTER 9 Reporting GHG Emissions 63STANDARD
