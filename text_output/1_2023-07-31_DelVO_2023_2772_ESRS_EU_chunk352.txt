Objective
1. The objective of this Standard is to specify Disclosure Requirements which will enable users of the sustainability
statement to understand:
(a) how the undertaking affects resource use, including resource efficiency, avoiding the depletion of resources and
the sustainable sourcing and use of renewable resources (referred to in this Standard as “resource use and
circular economy”) in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;
(b) any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent or mitigate actual or potential negative impacts
arising from resource use, including its measures to help decoupling its economic growth from the use of
materials, and to address risks and opportunities;OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
