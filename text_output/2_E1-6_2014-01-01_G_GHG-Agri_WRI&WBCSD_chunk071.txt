or take advant age of financial incentives . Payments for Environmental Services ( PESs ) are incentives offered to fa rmers or landowners in exchange for managing their land to provide some sort of ecological service . Box 8 - 1 shows some examples of conservation areas and PESs .

Natural disturbances, conservation areas, and PESs are treated identically to other
sources and activities
The CO
2 fluxes associated with natural distur bances, conservation ar eas and PESs should
be treated the same way as other CO 2 fluxes, following the recommendations outlined
above. The reason is that companies often have some measure of control over these
fluxes - they are often be able to influence th e frequency or intensit y of disturbances and
the corresponding amount of emissions, while  operational decisions frequently lead 
directly to the formation of  conservation areas. For instance, many forest management 
practices can reduce the risk of  disturbances - forest thi nning can increase resilience to Box 8-1. Examples of 
conservation areas and
PESs in agriculture

 droughts and insect/diseases outbreaks, while  fuel hazard reduction and the use of 
prescribed fires can reduce the risk of unc ontrolled fires. Another reason for not
excluding natural disturbances is that it is of ten challenging to identify whether an event
actually constitutes a disturbance. For instance,  there are no universally accepted criteria 
for defining droughts.
