ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 149/284AR 25. The targets related to the potentially material sustainability matters listed in paragraph AR 4 of this Standard, may
be presented in a table as illustrated below:

AR 26. Measurable targets related to biodiversity and ecosystems may be expressed as:
(a) size and location of all habitat areas protected or restored, whether directly or indirectly controlled by the
undertaking, and whether the success of the restoration measure was or is approved by independent external
professionals;
(b) recreated surfaces (environments in which management initiatives are implemented so as to create a habitat on
a site where it did not exist initially); or
(c) number or percentage of projects / sites whose ecological integrity was improved (e.g., installation of fish
passes, wildlife corridors).
Disclosure Requirement E4-5 â€“ Impact metrics related to biodiversity and ecosystems change
AR 27. When preparing the information required under this Disclosure Requirement, the undertaking shall consider and
may describe:
(a) the methodologies and metrics used and an explanation for why these methodologies and metrics are selected,
as well as their assumptions, limitations and uncertainties, and any changes in methodologies made over time
and why they occurred;
(b) the scope of the metrics and methodologies, for example:
i.undertaking, site, brand, commodity, corporate business unit, activity;
ii.aspects (as set out in paragraph AR 4) covered.
(c) the biodiversity components of the metrics: species specific, ecosystem specific;
(d) the geographies covered by the methodology and an explanation of why any relevant geographies were omitted;
(e) how the metrics integrate ecological thresholds (e.g., the biosphere integrity and land-system change,
planetary boundaries) and allocations;
(f) the frequency of monitoring, key metrics being monitored, and the baseline condition/value and
baseline year/period, as well as the reference period;
(g) whether these metrics rely on primary data, secondary data, modelled data or on expert judgement, or a mixture of these;
(h) an indication of which action is measured and monitored via the metrics and how they relate to the
achievement of targets;
(i) whether metrics are mandatory (required by legislation) or voluntary. If they are mandatory, the undertaking
