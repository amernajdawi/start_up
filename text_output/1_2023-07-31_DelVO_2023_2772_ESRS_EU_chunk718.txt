ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 268/284combined with bioenergy production (Bioenergy with Carbon Capture &
Storage - BECCS). Removals can be subject to reversals, which are any
movement of stored GHG out of the intended storage that re-enters the
atmosphere. For example, if a forest that was grown to remove a specific amount of CO2 is subject to a wildfire, the emissions captured in the trees
are reversed.
Global warming potential (GWP) A factor describing the radiative forcing impact (degree of harm to the
atmosphere) of one unit of a given GHG relative to one unit of CO2.
Greenhouse Gases (GHG) The gases listed in Part 2 of Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the
European Parliament and of the Council (
13). These include Carbon dioxide
(CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6),
Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), Perfluorocarbons
(PFCs).
Grievance mechanism Any routinized, state-based or non-state-based, judicial or non-judicial processes through which stakeholders can raise grievances and seek
remedy . Examples of state-based judicial and non-judicial grievance
mechanisms include courts, labour tribunals, national human rights
institutions, National Contact Points under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, ombudsperson offices, consumer protection
agencies, regulatory oversight bodies, and government-run complaints
offices. Non-state-based grievance mechanisms include those administered
by the undertaking, either alone or together with stakeholders, such as
operational-level grievance mechanisms and collective bargaining,
including the mechanisms established by collective bargaining. They also
include mechanisms administered by industry associations, international
organisations, civil society organisations, or multi-stakeholder groups.
Operational-level grievance mechanisms are administered by the
organisation either alone or in collaboration with other parties and are directly accessible by the organisationâ€™s stakeholders. They allow for
