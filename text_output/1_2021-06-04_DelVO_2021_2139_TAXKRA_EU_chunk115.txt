(5) Pollution prevention and control  For installations falling within the scope of Directive 2010/75/EU of the 
European Parliament and of the Council (  174  ), emissions are within or 
lower than the emission levels associated with the best available techniques
(BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the latest relevant best available techniques
(BAT) conclusions, including the best available techniques (BAT)
conclusions for large combustion plants (  175  ). No significant cross-media 
effects occur.
For combustion plants with thermal input greater than 1 MW but below
the thresholds for the BAT conclusions for large combustion plants to
apply, emissions are below the emission limit values set out in Annex II,
part 2, to Directive (EU) 2015/2193.
For plants in zones or parts of zones not complying with the air quality
limit values laid down in Directive 2008/50/EC, measures are implemented
to reduce emission levels taking into account the results of the
information exchange (  176  ) which are published by the Commission in 
accordance with Article 6, paragraphs 9 and 10, of Directive (EU)
2015/2193.
For anaerobic digestion of organic material, where the produced digestate
is used as fertiliser or soil improver, either directly or after composting or
any other treatment, it meets the requirements for fertilising materials set
out in Component Material Categories (CMC) 4 and 5 in Annex II to
Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 or national rules on fertilisers or soil
improvers for agricultural use.
For anaerobic digestion plants treating over 100 tonnes per day, emissions
to air and water are within or lower than the emission levels associated
with the best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set for anaerobic
treatment of waste in the latest relevant best available techniques (BAT)
conclusions, including the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for
waste treatment (  177  ). No significant cross-media effects occur.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
4.9.  Transmission and distribution of electricity  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of transmission systems that transport the electricity on the extra high-voltage and
high-voltage interconnected system.  
Construction and operation of distribution systems that transport electricity on high-voltage, medium-voltage and
low-voltage distribution systems.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular D35.12 and
D35.13 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.

pollution prevention and control) (OJ L 334, 17.12.2010, p. 17).  
( 175  ) Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/1442.  
( 176  ) The final technology report resulting from the exchange of information with Member States, the industries concerned and non- 
governmental organisations contains technical information on best available technologies used in medium combustion plants to
reduce their environmental impacts, and on the emission levels achievable with best available and emerging technologies and the  
related costs (version of 4.6.2021: https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/06f33a94-9829-4eee-b187-21bb783a0fbf/library/9a99a632-
