 The reporting period covered.  
 Data for all seven GHGs
(CO 2, CH 4, N2O, SF 6, PFCs,
HFCs and NF 3),
disaggregated by GHG and
reported in units of both
metric tonnes and tonnes
CO 2-equivalent (CO 2e).  
 Total scope 1 and 2
emissions.  
 Data disaggregated by scope.  Scope 1 data disaggregated by
mechanical versus non-
mechanical sources.
 Data reported in the scopes
without subtractions for trades in offsets.   
 Methodologies used to
calculate or measure
emissions, providing a
reference or link to any
calculation tools used.  
 Whether the calculation
methodologies used for ‘non-
mechanical’ sources are IPCC
Tier 1, 2, or 3.
 Methodology used (where
relevant) to amortize the CO 2
fluxes to/from C stocks.
 Assumptions regarding any use
of proxy data in calculating the
impacts of historical changes in
management on C stocks.

 Year chosen as base year, and
an emissions profile over time that is consistent with and clarifies the chosen policy for making base year emissions recalculations.

 Appropriate context for any
significant emissions changes
that trigger base year
emissions recalculation.  
 Any specific exclusions of
sources, facilities, and / or operations.
 Any exclusions of the impacts
of historical management
practices on C stocks.
 CO 2 emissions from
biologically sequestered
carbon, separately from the
scopes.
 Biologically sequestered
carbon reported outside of the
scopes (but is optional to
report).  Net CO 2 flux data for the C
stocks in above-ground and
below-ground biomass, DOM
and soils (in tonnes CO 2).
 Where LUC results in a
reduction in the size of C
stocks, report the CO 2
emissions in Scope 1.
 Otherwise, report all CO 2
fluxes outside of the scopes in
a separate category (‘Biogenic
Carbon’) divided into three
components: (1) CO 2 fluxes
(emissions or removals) during
land use management; (2)
Sequestration during LUC;
and (3) CO 2 emissions from
biofuel combustion.  
 Account for historical changes
in land use or management
occurring on or after the base
period.
 Use a ‘fixed-rate’ approach to
amortize change in C stocks
over time.
