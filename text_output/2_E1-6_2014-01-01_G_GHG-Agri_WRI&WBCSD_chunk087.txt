Contextual information should be provided
Importantly, the inherent divers ity of agricultural practices, as well as the influence of
environmental factors on GHG fluxes, will aff ect the comparability of metrics, both
within and across businesses. For example:
 Intensity ratios will often be higher for self-replacing livestock herds than non-
replacement herds. This is because self -replacing herds contain younger stock that
emit enteric CH 4 and produce N 2O from urine depositions for a longer period of time
before contributing to farm products.  
 Adverse weather conditions can lower re alized crop yields, causing inter-annual
variation in intensity ratios , independent of any changes in farming practices. (Note:
in such cases, companies may find it usef ul to normalize and report emissions by
expected yield, in addition to actual yield).  
Without adequate context on the farming system, environmental effects, and the
emissions sources that have been studie d, performance metrics are not useful for
assessing performance. Such context should be provided in reports to aid the reliable
interpretation of performance metrics.

 Table I-1.  Advantages and disadvantages of common performance metrics  
Metric Advantages Disadvantages
GHG flux per
unit land area (e.g., flux / ha)  Useful to companies that define
policies or that manage large amounts of land (e.g., government agencies)
 Reflective of the overall level of
GHG fluxes on farms  Fails to consider efficiency of farm
production   
GHG flux per
unit product
(e.g., flux / tonne beef)  Better allows for comparisons within
the same industry  
 Better able to represent the effects of
mitigation measures that have a relatively small GHG impact, but that nonetheless improve productivity  
 Performance data are frequently
sought by buyers on a per-product basis   Calculation may be complicated by the 
variety of products that come from
farms and the different allocation
methods used to assign GHG fluxes (see below)
 Does not consider product value  
 Does not reflect the overall climate
impact of farms (which would vary depending on the volume of products
produced)
GHG flux per unit of farm
input (e.g., flux / MJ metabolisable energy intake)  Provides an understanding of the
effects of feed type and amount on
animal systems, or of the efficiency
of nutrient use in cropping systems   Calculation may be complicated by the 
need to allocate GHG fluxes
