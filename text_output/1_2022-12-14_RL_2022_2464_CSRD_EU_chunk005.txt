(3) In its Communication of 17 June 2019 entitled ‘Guidelines on non-f inancial repor ting: Supplement on repor ting
climat e-related information’ (‘Guidelines on repor ting climat e-relat ed information’), the Commission highlighted the
benefits for companies of repor ting on climate-relat ed information particularly by increasing awareness and
understanding of climate -related risks and oppor tunities within the compan y, diversifying the inve stor base,
creating a lower cost of capital and impro ving constr uctive dialogue with all stakeho lders. Further more, diversity on
compan y boards might have an influence on decision-making, corporate governance and resilience.
(4) In its conclusions of 5 December 2019 on the deepening of the Capital Mark ets Union, the Council stressed the
imp ortance of reliable, comparable and relevant information on sustainability risks, oppor tunities and impacts, and
called on the Commission to consider the development of a European non-fi nancial repor ting standard.
(5) In its resolution of 29 May 2018 on sustainable finance (14), the European Parliament called for the further
development of non-financial repor ting requirements in the framework of Directive 2013/34/EU. In its resolution
of 17 December 2020 on sustainable corporate governance (15), the European Parliament welcomed the
Commission’s commitment to review Directive 2013/34/EU and expressed the need to set up a compreh ensive
Union framework on non-fi nancial repor ting that contains mandatory Union non-fi nancial repor ting standards.
The European Parliament called for the expansion of the scope of the repor ting requirements to additional
catego ries of under takings and for the introduction of an audit requirement.
(6) In its resolution of 25 Sept ember 2015 entitled ‘Transf orming our world: the 2030 Agen da for Sustainable
Development’ (the ‘2030 Agen da’) the Unit ed Nations (UN) General Assembly adopt ed a new global sustainable
development framew ork. The 2030 Agen da has at its core the UN Sustainable Development Goals (‘SDGs’ ) and
covers the three dimensions of sustainability : economic, social and environmental. The Commission
Communication of 22 November 2016 entitled ‘Next steps for a sustainable European future: European action for
sustainability’ linked the SDGs to the Union policy framew ork to ensure that all Union actions and policy initiatives,
both within and outside the Union, take those goals on board at the outset. In its conclusions of 20 June 2017 on ‘A
sustainable European future: The EU response to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, the Council
conf irmed the commitment of the Union and its Member States to the implementation of the 2030 Agen da in a
full, coherent, comprehensive, integrat ed and effective manner , in close cooperation with partners and other
stake holders.
(7) Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (16)amended Directive 2013/34/EU as regards
disclosure of non-fi nancial information by certain large under takings and groups. Directive 2014/95/EU introduced
a requirement on under takings to repor t information on, as a minimum, environmental, social and emplo yee
matte rs, respect for human rights, anti-cor ruption and briber y matters. With regard to those topics, Directive
2014/95/EU required under takings to disclose information under the followi ng repor ting areas: business model;
policies, including due diligence processes; the outcome of those policies; risks and risk management; and key
performa nce indicator s relevant to the business.
(8) Many stak eholders consider the term ‘non-financial’ to be inaccurate , in particular because it implies that the
information in question has no financia l relevance. Increasing ly, however , such information does have financial
relevance. Many organisations, initiatives and practitioners in the field of sustainability repor ting refer to
‘sustainability information’. It is theref ore preferable to use the term ‘sustainability information’ in place of ‘non-
financial information’. Directive 2013/34/EU should theref ore be amended to take account of that chang e in
term inology .
