ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 144/284AR 6. The undertaking shall assess the materiality of biodiversity and ecosystems in its own operations and its upstream
and downstream value chain, and may conduct its materiality assessment in line with the first three phases of the
LEAP approach: Locate (paragraph AR 7), Evaluate (paragraph AR 8) and Assess (paragraph AR 9).
AR 7. Phase 1 relates to the localisation of relevant sites regarding its interface with biodiversity and ecosystems. To
identify these relevant sites the undertaking may:
(a) develop a list of locations of direct assets and operations and related upstream and downstream value chain
that are relevant to the undertakings business activities. Furthermore, the undertaking may provide
information about sites for which future operations have been formally announced;
(b) list the biomes and ecosystems it is interfacing with based on the list of locations identified under paragraph
AR 7(a);
(c) identify the current integrity and importance of biodiversity and ecosystem at each location taking into
consideration the information provided in paragraphs 16 and 17;
(d) develop a list of locations where the undertaking is interfacing with locations in or near biodiversity-sensitive
areas taking into consideration the information provided in paragraphs 16 and 17; and
(e) identify which sectors, business units, value chains or asset classes are interfacing with biodiversity and ecosystems in these material sites. Instead of identifying these interfaces per site, the undertaking may choose
to identify them per raw material procured or sold by weight in tons, if such practice offers greater
transparency.
AR 8. In Phase 2, to evaluate its actual or potential impacts and dependencies on biodiversity and ecosystems for relevant
sites, the undertaking may:
(a) identify business processes and activities that interface with biodiversity and ecosystems;
(b) identify actual and potential impacts and dependencies;
(c) indicate the size, scale, frequency of occurrence and timeframe of the impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems taking into consideration the disclosures under paragraphs 16 and 17. Furthermore, the undertaking may
disclose:
i.the percentage of its suppliers â€™ facilities which are located in risk prone areas (with threatened species on
the IUCN Red List of Species, the Birds and Habitats Directive or nationally list of threatened species, or in officially recognised Protected Areas, the Natura 2000 network of protected areas and Key Biodiversity
Areas);
ii.the percentage of its procurement spend from suppliers with facilities which are located in risk prone areas
