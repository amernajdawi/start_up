12.1 Introduction
Assurance is the level of confidence that the inventory results and report are
complete, accurate, consistent, transparent, relevant, and without material
misstatements.1 Obtaining assurance over the product inventory is valuable for
reporting companies and other stakeholders when making decisions using the inventory results.
Carefully and comprehensively documenting the inventory process in a data management plan
is a vital step in preparing for assurance.
12.2 Requirements
The product GHG inventory shall be assured
by a first or third party.
Three key parties are involved in the assurance process:
1. The reporting company seeking assurance
2. Stakeholder users of the inventory report
3. The assurer(s)
When the reporting company also performs the
assurance, this is known as first party assurance. When a party other than the reporting company performs  
the assurance, this is known as third party assurance.  
Table 12.1 explains the differences between first and
third party assurance.
Both first and third party assurers should follow similar
procedures and processes. For external stakeholders,
third party assurance is likely to increase the credibility
of the GHG inventory. However, first party assurance can
also provide confidence in the reliability of the inventory
report, and can be a worthwhile learning experience for  
a company prior to commissioning third party assurance.
