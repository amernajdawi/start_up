Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  The activity manufactures one of the following: 
(a) iron and steel where GHG emissions (  146  ), reduced by the amount of 
emissions assigned to the production of waste gases in accordance
with point 10.1.5(a) of Annex VII to Regulation (EU) 2019/331 do
not exceed the following values applied to the different manufacturing
process steps:
(i) hot metal =1,443 (  147  ) tCO  2 e/t product; 
(ii) sintered ore = 0,242 (  148  ) tCO  2 e/t product; 
(iii) coke (excluding lignite coke) = 0,237 (  149  ) tCO  2 e/t product; 
(iv) iron casting = 0,390 (  150  ) tCO  2 e/t product; 
(v) electric arc furnace (EAF) high alloy steel = 0,360 (  151  ) tCO  2 e/t 
product;
(vi) electric arc furnace (EAF) carbon steel = 0,276 (  152  )] tCO  2 e/t 
product.
(b) steel in electric arc furnaces (EAFs) producing EAF carbon steel or EAF
high alloy steel as defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)
2019/331 and where the steel scrap input relative to product output
is:
(i) at least 70 % for the production of high alloy steel
(ii) at least 90 % for production of carbon steel.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.
