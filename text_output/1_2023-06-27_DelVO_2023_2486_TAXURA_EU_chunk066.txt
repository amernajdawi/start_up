ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 46/1642.5. Recovery of bio-waste by anaerobic digestion or composting
Description of the activity
Construction and operation of facilities for the treatment of separately collected bio-waste through anaerobic digestion or
composting with the resulting production and utilisation of biogas, biomethane, digestate, compost or chemicals.
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E38.21 and F42.9 in
accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.
Technical screening criteria
Substantial contribution to the transition to circular economy
1.The bio-waste that is used for anaerobic digestion or composting is source segregated and collected separately. Where
bio-waste is collected in biodegradable bags, the bags have the appropriate compostable certification standard EN
13432:2000 (58).
2.In these anaerobic digestion plants, source segregated bio-waste from separate collection constitutes at least 70 % of the
input feedstock, measured in weight, as an annual average. Co-digestion may cover up to 30 % of the input feedstock of
advanced bioenergy feedstock listed in Annex IX to Directive (EU) 2018/2001, which may not include contaminated
feedstock coming from biomass fraction of mixed municipal and industrial waste. The input does not include feedstock
excluded in Part II of Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2019/1009, for Component Material Category (CMC) 3 (Compost) in
accordance with point (c) of that category and for Component Material Category (CMC) 5 (Digestate other than fresh crop
digestate) in accordance with point (c) of that category.
3.The activity produces one of the following:
(a) compost or digestate complying with Regulation (EU) 2019/1009, in particular with requirements of Annex II on the
Component Material Categories (CMC), referring specifically to CMC 3 (Compost) and CMC 5 (Digestate other than
fresh crop digestate) or with national rules on fertilisers or soil improvers, with equal or stricter requirements
compared to those of Regulation 2019/1009;
(b) chemicals through the conversion of organic waste to carboxylates, carboxylic acids or polymers by fermentation with mixed cultures.
4. Quality assurance of the production process is performed using Module D1 set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/1009.
5.Compost and digestate complying with Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 or equivalent national rules is not landfilled.
The digestate is preferably composted after anaerobic digestion to maximise benefits to the soil it is applied to afterwards,
and minimises some potential agro-environmental issues such as release of ammonia and nitrates.
6.Where anaerobic digestion is installed, the produced biogas is used directly for the generation of electricity or heat,
upgraded to bio-methane for use as a fuel, directly injected in the gas grid and further used for energy purposes by
replacing natural gas, used as industry feedstock to produce other chemicals or converted into hydrogen for use as a fuel.
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)
(1) Climate change mitigation A monitoring and contingency plan is in place to minimise methane leakage at the
facility.
