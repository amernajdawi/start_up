Quantitative uncertainty assessment is not required,
but such an assessment is desirable since it can provide
a more robust result that can identify specific areas of
high uncertainty to track over time. Companies may wish
to present both qualitative and quantitative uncertainty
information in the inventory report. Companies may
also describe their efforts to reduce uncertainty in
future revisions of the inventory. Table 10.2 includes the
required qualitative uncertainty sources to report.
10.3.4 Uncertainty in comparisons
Comparative uncertainty differs from the various types
of uncertainty previously mentioned in that more than
one product or system is considered. This standard is
not intended to support product comparison beyond
performance tracking (as described in chapter 1).
However, even within a product inventory, comparative
uncertainty may arise, such as when comparing the
impact of one process or stage to another process or
stage in the productâ€™s life cycle.
Whenever considering uncertainty in comparisons, the
uncertainty ranges of each process, life cycle stage, or
product should not be directly compared; instead, the
uncertainty in the comparison itself should be assessed.
That is, rather than comparing the distribution of A
and the distribution of B, companies may assess the
distribution of A divided by B.  This can be done for both 
parameter uncertainty and scenario uncertainty.
