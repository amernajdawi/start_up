[110]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standardguidance
14.3 Guidance
14.3.1  Steps for setting reduction targets and 
tracking changes
Setting reduction targets and tracking changes involves
the following steps:
1. Complete and report a base inventory done in
conformance with the requirements of this standard.
2. Identify reduction opportunities.
3. Set a reduction target.
4. Achieve reductions and account for these by
performing an updated inventory.
5. Recalculate the base inventory as needed when
significant changes in the inventory occur, including,
but not limited to: changes in the productâ€™s boundary;
quality of data; and allocation or recycling methods.6. Complete and disclose an updated inventory report
including the updated results and the base inventory
results. Companies should report the inventory results
as a percentage change over time on the unit of
analysis basis.
The following section describes each step in more detail.
Step 1:  Complete and report a base inventory
The first step is to ensure that a base inventory has been
completed and publically reported in conformance with
this standard. The base inventory does not have to be
the first inventory a company performs on a product; for
example, companies may want to improve data quality
before finalizing the base inventory. Once a company has
identified the base inventory, however, any changes made
that warrant a recalculation should be done following the
guidance in step 5.
