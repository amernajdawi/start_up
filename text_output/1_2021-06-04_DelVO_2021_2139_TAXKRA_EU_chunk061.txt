Detailed information referred to in point 1.2.(i) includes provisions for
maintaining and possibly enhancing biodiversity in accordance with
national and local provisions, including the following:
(a) ensuring the good conservation status of habitat and species, main ­
tenance of typical habitat species;
(b) excluding the use or release of invasive alien species;
(c) excluding the use of non-native species unless it can be demonstrated
that:
(i) the use of the forest reproductive material leads to favourable and
appropriate ecosystem conditions (such as climate, soil criteria and
vegetation zone, forest fire resilience);
(ii) the native species currently present on the site are not anymore
adapted to projected climatic and pedo-hydrological conditions.
(d) ensuring the maintenance and improvement of physical, chemical and
biological quality of the soil;
(e) promoting biodiversity-friendly practices that enhance forests’ natural
processes;
(f) excluding the conversion of high-biodiverse ecosystems into less
biodiverse ones;
(g) ensuring the diversity of associated habitats and species linked to the
forest;
(h) ensuring the diversity of stand structures and maintenance or
enhancing of mature stage stands and dead wood.  
1.3.  Forest management  
Description of the activity  
Forest management as defined by national law. Where national law does not contain such a definition, forest
management corresponds to any economic activity resulting from a system applicable to a forest that influences
the ecological, economic or social functions of the forest. Forest management assumes no change in land use and
occurs on land matching the definition of forest as set out in national law, or where not available, in accordance
with the FAO definition of forest (  39 ). 
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code A2 in accordance with the statistical
classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006. The economic activities in this
category are limited to NACE II 02.10, i.e. silviculture and other forestry activities, 02.20, i.e. logging, 02.30,
i.e. gathering of wild growing non-wood products and 02.40, i.e. support services to forestry.EN  9.12.2021 Official Journal of the European Union L 442/27  
( 39 ) Land spanning more than 0,5 hectares with trees higher than five meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 %, or trees able t o
reach those thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use, FAO Global  
Resources Assessment 2020. Terms and definitions (version of 4.6.2021: http://www.fao.org/3/I8661EN/i8661en.pdf).
