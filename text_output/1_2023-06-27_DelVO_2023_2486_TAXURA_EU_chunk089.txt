Substantial contribution to the transition to a circular economy
1.Where main road elements (binder course, surface course or concrete slabs) are demolished or removed, the preparing
for re-use (126)or recycling (127)of the non-hazardous waste generated onsite is 100 % (by mass in kilogrammes), excluding
backfilling (128). This excludes naturally occurring material referred to in category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste
established by Decision 2000/532/EC.
2.Where the road elements (binder course, surface course and concrete slabs) are newly installed after demolition or
removal, including any roads which are built on a temporary basis for the purpose of carrying out the maintenance works,
at least 50 % (by mass in kilogrammes) of the structural road elements used are re-used or recycled materials or non-
hazardous industrial by-products.
3.The re-used or recycled materials are not moved over distances greater than 2,5 times the distance between the
construction site and the nearest production facility for equivalent primary raw materials, to avoid that the use of re-used
or recycled materials leads to higher CO 2 emissions than the use of primary raw materials.
4.Where newly installed, the binder course has a service lifetime no shorter than 20 years (129).
5.The use of primary raw material for road furniture is minimised through the use of secondary raw materials (130). The
operator of the activity ensures that for metals, such as steel restraint systems, a maximum of 30 % of the material come
from primary raw material. The threshold is calculated by subtracting the secondary raw material from the total amount of
each material category used in the works measured by mass in kilogrammes. Where the information on the recycled
content of the construction product is not available, it is to be counted as comprising 100 % primary raw material. In
order to respect the Waste Hierarchy and thereby favour re-use over recycling, re-used construction products, including
those containing non-waste materials reprocessed on site, are to be counted as comprising zero primary raw material.
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)(1) Climate change mitigation A traffic congestion mitigation plan to be implemented during the maintenance works is
presented.
(2) Climate change adaptation The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.
(126)‘Preparing for re-use’ means checking, cleaning or repairing recovery operations, by which products or components of products that
have become waste are prepared so that they can be re-used without any other pre-processing. This includes, for instance, the
preparation for re-use of certain parts of buildings like roof elements, windows, doors, bricks, stones or concrete elements. A pre-
requisite for the preparation for re-use of building elements is usually the selective deconstruction of buildings or other structures.
(127)‘Recycling’ means any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances whether
for the original or other purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material but does not include energy recovery and the
reprocessing into materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations.
(128)‘Backfilling’ means any recovery operation where suitable non-hazardous waste is used for purposes of reclamation in excavated areas
or for engineering purposes in landscaping. Waste used for backfilling must substitute non-waste materials, be suitable for the
aforementioned purposes, and be limited to the amount strictly necessary to achieve those purposes.
