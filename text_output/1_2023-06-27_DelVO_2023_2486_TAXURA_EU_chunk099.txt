ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 69/164(d) supporting optimisation and intensification of the use of products, through circular business models such as providing
products as a service or peer-to-peer sharing.
4.For lifecycle assessment software, at least one of the following capabilities specified in points (a) to (c) is met in its full
scope:
(a) supporting the life cycle assessment of products, equipment or infrastructure with software-implemented methods and
algorithms according to relevant standards such as Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279, ISO 14067:2018 (154)or ISO
14040:2006 (155);
(b) providing data required for lifecycle analysis, such as standard carbon emission values and other environmental impacts
for frequently used products and materials or production steps;
(c) providing recommendations for improving the design of a product, equipment, or infrastructure so as to minimise
their material and carbon footprint.
5.For design and engineering software, at least one of the following capabilities specified in points (a) to (e) is met in its full
scope:
(a) supporting users to formulate, document and manage product-specific circularity and other environmental design
goals and requirements, such as design-for-remanufacturability, design-for-serviceability, minimal environmental
impact from using or operating the product, minimal waste during production or construction and tailored
production to eliminate over-specification and reduce material inputs;
(b) supporting users to explore product designs for the purpose of assessing and optimising product designs against specified circular or other environmental objectives, or finding the best trade-off between conflicting design goals,
such as robustness v material use, greener material v costing or installing schedule or cost of downstream reuse and
recycling systems;
(c) validating a design through analysis and simulation against specified circularity and other environmental design goals
and requirements;
(d) supporting the computer-aided product design process – including mechanical, electrical, electronic or recipe design –
with data and information about the impact of design and construction decisions on circularity and environmental
performance;
(e) supporting the selection of materials and components with a low environmental impact through the provision of data
about market-available materials and components and their cost.
6.For supplier management software, at least one of the following capabilities specified in points (a) to (e) is met in its full
scope:
(a) providing the user with information about suppliers and supplies of circular products, immediate products,
components and materials that are designed for closed loop systems, reuse, remanufacturing or repurposing. The
information provided exceeds the minimum information requirements in existing Union law (
156);
(b) supporting the management and tracking suppliers’ compliance with standards and certifications related to the
provision of such materials, products, and components;
(c) supporting the exchange with suppliers of data required to verify the environmental performance of supplied materials,
products, and components;
(d) supporting the trading and matchmaking between suppliers and purchasers of circular, eco-designed or otherwise eco-
friendly products, materials, and components;
