 Table I-1.  Advantages and disadvantages of common performance metrics  
Metric Advantages Disadvantages
GHG flux per
unit land area (e.g., flux / ha)  Useful to companies that define
policies or that manage large amounts of land (e.g., government agencies)
 Reflective of the overall level of
GHG fluxes on farms  Fails to consider efficiency of farm
production   
GHG flux per
unit product
(e.g., flux / tonne beef)  Better allows for comparisons within
the same industry  
 Better able to represent the effects of
mitigation measures that have a relatively small GHG impact, but that nonetheless improve productivity  
 Performance data are frequently
sought by buyers on a per-product basis   Calculation may be complicated by the 
variety of products that come from
farms and the different allocation
methods used to assign GHG fluxes (see below)
 Does not consider product value  
 Does not reflect the overall climate
impact of farms (which would vary depending on the volume of products
produced)
GHG flux per unit of farm
input (e.g., flux / MJ metabolisable energy intake)  Provides an understanding of the
effects of feed type and amount on
animal systems, or of the efficiency
of nutrient use in cropping systems   Calculation may be complicated by the 
need to allocate GHG fluxes

GHG flux per
unit of quality
content in final
product (e.g., per unit of fat, protein or metabolisable energy content)  Considers a fundamental objective of
most agricultural production – to provide food energy  
 Calculation may be complicated by the
need to allocate GHG fluxes
