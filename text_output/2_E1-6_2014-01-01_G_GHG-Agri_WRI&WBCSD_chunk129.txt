Case C: Purchase of land unde rgoing changes in C stocks
Same as Case A, but the land is acquired by the reporting company (a t year 28) after its
conversion into pasture (Figure II-2). The reporting company amortizes the CO 2 fluxes from this
conversion over a 20 year period (ending year 25), but does not include all of these fluxes in its
inventories. Instead, it only revises its inventories to report the CO 2 fluxes that occurred during
years 20â€“25. This is because year 20 was established as its base pe riod. Table II-4 describes how
the changes in C stocks are amor tized by the reporting company.
 Figure II-2.  The reporting company purchases land that  is undergoing changes in C stocks 
because of a shift in land use made by a prior owner (Case C)
