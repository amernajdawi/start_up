enhancing GHG removals) that the project is intended to achieve. (Chapter 8)
Process emissions Emissions generated from manufacturing processes, such as the CO
2that is arises from the break-
down of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) during cement manufacture. (Chapter 4, Appendix D)
Productivity/efficiency ratios Ratios that express the value or achievement of a business divided by its GHG impact. Increasing effi-
ciency ratios reflect a positive performance improvement. e.g. resource productivity(sales per tonneGHG). Productivity/efficiency ratios are the inverse of intensity ratios. (Chapter 9)
Ratio indicator Indicators providing information on relative performance such as intensity ratios or productivity/effi-
ciency ratios. (Chapter 9)
