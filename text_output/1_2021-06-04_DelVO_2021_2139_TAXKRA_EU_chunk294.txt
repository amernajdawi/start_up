3.3. All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation
measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well
as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water.
Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the
ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies:
(a) measures to ensure downstream and upstream fish migration (such as
fish friendly turbines, fish guidance structures, state-of the-art fully
functional fish passes, measures to stop or minimise operation and
discharges during migration or spawning);
(b) measures to ensure minimum ecological flow (including mitigation of
rapid, short-term variations in flow or hydro-peaking operations) and
sediment flow;
(c) measures to protect or enhance habitats.
The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the
authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good
status or potential of the affected water body.
3.4. The plant does not permanently compromise the achievement of
good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin
district.
3.5. In addition to the mitigation measures referred to above, and
where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that
the project does not increase the fragmentation of water bodies in the
same river basin district. This is achieved by restoring continuity within
the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption
of continuity, which the planned hydropower plant may cause. Compen ­
sation starts prior to the execution of the project.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  N/A  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex (  258  ). 
4.6.  Electricity generation from geothermal energy  
Description of the activity  
Construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity from geothermal energy.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular D35.11 and
F42.22 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.
