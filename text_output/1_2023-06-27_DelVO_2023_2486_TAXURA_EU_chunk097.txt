Substantial contribution to the transition to a circular economy
1.The economic activity manufactures, develops, installs, deploys, maintains, repairs or provides professional services,
including technical consulting for design or monitoring, to one or more of the following IT/OT data-driven solutions that
provide the capabilities listed below. Such IT/OT data-driven solutions include sensors (such as power, temperature,
vibration, video, sound, viscosity), data collection and communication equipment, data repository (edge or cloud), and
software. Where these capabilities are part of a broader software or IT/OT offering, only specific software add-ons
implementing these capabilities qualify.
2.For remote monitoring and predictive maintenance systems, at least two of the following capabilities specified in points
(a) to (d) are met in their full scope:
(a) alerting the user to abnormal sensor values, and assessing the status of the product, equipment, or infrastructure,
detecting wear and tear or electrical issues, and drawing conclusions about the exact nature of abnormal operating
conditions by means of advanced analytical methods;
(b) predicting the expected remaining lifetime of a product, equipment, or infrastructure, and recommending measures to
extend the remaining lifetime;
(c) predicting an upcoming product, equipment or infrastructure failure and recommending measures to prevent such failure;
(d) providing recommendations about the highest value next use cycle, such as reuse, recovering components through
parts harvesting for remanufacture, or recycling, taking into consideration a combination of factors regarding the
product’s condition.
IT/OT systems aimed at (i) monitoring for the replacement of consumables (
151), such as printer ink; (ii) remote monitoring
and remote maintenance of power generation plants that are more greenhouse gas intensive than 100 gCO 2e/kWh; or (iii)
monitoring and remote management of any type of fossil fuel engine; do not qualify.
3.For tracking and tracing software and IT/OT systems, at least one of the following capabilities specified in points (a) to
(d) is met in its full scope:
(a) providing identification, tracking and tracing of materials, products and assets through value chains in order to make
accessible structured data (such as material content, substances, environmental information) required for lifecycle
assessments or material declarations according to relevant standards, such as Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279, ISO
14067:2018 (152)or ISO 14040:2006 (153), and sharing of such data with value chain partners, consumers, and other
economic actors in compliance with relevant standards regarding data modelling, interoperability, data privacy and
data security;
(b) provisioning and sharing of documents and data directly supporting the repair and maintenance of products and equipment, such as repair instruction, test equipment, wiring and connection diagrams, diagnostic fault and error
codes, disassembly instructions;
(c) supporting reverse logistics, including the take-back of products for remanufacturing, refurbishment or recycling, by
managing steps and transactions in the take-back process, such as pick-up order placement, tracking of sales
transaction data, decomposition of product into materials to be re-injected into circular material flows, and by
optimising decisions to prevent downcycling and maximise resource recovery. Digital product passports meeting the
minimum requirements in Union law are not considered as taxonomy aligned;
(151)‘Consumables’ are non-durable commodities that are intended to be used, depleted or replaced. They may be required for the
functioning of a consumer product, or be used in fabrication, without being incorporated into the finished product.
