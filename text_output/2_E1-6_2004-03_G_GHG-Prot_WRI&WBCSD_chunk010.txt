s 2002total renewable energy procurement was 66 . 2 million kWh , whichrepresented 1 . 3 % of its electricity consumption worldwide and31 , 550 tonnes of CO 2compared to the previous year . Worldwide , IBM purchased a variety of sources of renewable energy including wind , biomass and solar . By accounting for these indirect emissions and looking for associ - ated reduction opportunities , IBM has successfully reduced animportant source of its overall GHG emissions .

Participating in mandatory reporting programs Some governments require GHG emitters to report their emissions annually. These typically focus on direct emis-sions from operations at operated or controlled facilitiesin specific geographic jurisdictions. In Europe, facilitiesfalling under the requirements of the IntegratedPollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive mustreport emissions exceeding a specified threshold for eachof the six GHGs. The reported emissions are included ina European Pollutant Emissions Register (EPER), apublicly accessible internet-based database that permitscomparisons of emissions from individual facilities orindustrial sectors in different countries (EC-DGE, 2000).In Ontario, Ontario Regulation 127 requires thereporting of GHG emissions (Ontario MOE, 2001). Participating in GHG markets Market-based approaches to reducing GHG emissionsare emerging in some parts of the world. In mostplaces, they take the form of emissions tradingprograms, although there are a number of otherapproaches adopted by countries, such as the taxationapproach used in Norway. Trading programs can beimplemented on a mandatory (e.g., the forthcoming EU ETS) or voluntary basis (e.g., CCX). Although trading programs, which determine compliance by comparing emissions with an emissions reductiontarget or cap, typically require accounting only fordirect emissions, there are exceptions. The UK ETS, forexample, requires direct entry participants to accountfor GHG emissions from the generation of purchasedelectricity (DEFRA, 2003). The CCX allows itsmembers the option of counting indirect emissions asso-ciated with electricity purchases as a supplementalreduction commitment. Other types of indirect emissionscan be more difficult to verify and may present challenges in terms of avoiding double counting.
