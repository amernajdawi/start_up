ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 260/284Area at water risk A water catchment, where several physical aspects related to water:
i.lead to one or more water bodies to be in less than good status and / or
deteriorate in status (as defined in Directive 2000/60/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council (4)), thus pointing to significant issues as
regards water availability, quality, quantity (including high water-stress);
and/or
ii.lead to issues as regards accessibility of water, regulatory or reputational issues (including the shared use of water with communities and
affordability of water) for its facilities and for the facilities of key
supplier(s).
Area of high-water stress Regions where the percentage of total water withdrawn is high (40-80%) or extremely high (greater than 80%) in the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool of
the World Resources Institute (WRI). See also water scarcity .
Associated process materials Materials that are needed for the manufacturing process but are not part of the final product, such as lubricants for manufacturing machinery.
Best Available Techniques (BAT)
conclusionsA document containing the parts of a BAT reference document laying down
the conclusions on best available techniques, their description, information
to assess their applicability, the emission levels associated with the best
available techniques, the environmental performance levels associated with the best available techniques, the minimum content of an
environmental management system including benchmarks associated with the best available techniques, associated monitoring, associated
consumption levels and, where appropriate, relevant site remediation
measures (
5).
Best Available Technique-Associated Emission Level (BAT-AEL)The range of emission levels obtained under normal operating conditions
using a best available technique or a combination of best available
techniques, as described in BAT conclusions, expressed as an average over
a given period of time, under specified reference conditions, i.e., the
emission level that is associated with a BAT .
Best Available Technique-Associated Environmental Performance Level (BAT-
AEPL)The range of environmental performance levels, except emission levels,
obtained under normal operating conditions using a BAT or a
combination of BAT s(
6).
Best Available Techniques (BAT) (7) The most effective and advanced stage in the development of activities and
their methods of operation which indicates the practical suitability of
particular techniques for providing the basis for emission limit values and
other permit conditions designed to prevent and, where that is not practicable, to reduce emissions and the impact on the environment as a
whole:i. “techniques” includes both the technology used and the way in which the
installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and
decommissioned;

action in the field of water policy (OJ L 327, 22.12.2000, p. 1).
(5)Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions (IED).
(6)Commission Implementing Decision of 10 February 2012 laying down rules concerning guidance on the collection of data and on the
drawing up of BAT reference documents and on their quality assurance referred to in Directive 2010/75/EU of the European
Parliament and of the Council on industrial emissions (OJ L 63, 2.3.2012, p. 1).
