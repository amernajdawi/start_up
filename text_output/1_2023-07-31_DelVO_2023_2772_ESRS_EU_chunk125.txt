ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 127/284(c) total water recycled and reused in m3; (68)
(d) total water stored and changes in storage in m3; and
(e) any contextual information necessary regarding points (a) to (d), including the water basins’ water quality and
quantity, how the data have been compiled, such as any standards, methodologies, and assumptions used,
including whether the information is calculated, estimated, modelled, or sourced from direct measurements, and
the approach taken for this, such as the use of any sector-specific factors.
29. The undertaking shall provide information on its water intensity : total water consumption in its own operations in
m3 per million EUR net revenue (69).
Disclosure Requirement E3-5 – Anticipated financial effects from material water and marine resources-related risks and
opportunities
30. The undertaking shall disclose the anticipated financial effects of material water and marine resources-related risks
and opportunities.
31. The information required by paragraph 30 is in addition to the information on current financial effects on the entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows for the reporting period required under ESRS 2 SBM-3 para
48 (d).
32. The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to provide an understanding of:
(a) anticipated financial effects due to material risks arising from water and marine resources-related impacts and
dependencies and how these risks have (or could reasonably be expected to have) a material influence on the
undertaking’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows, over the short-, medium- and long-term;
and
(b) anticipated financial effects due to material opportunities related to water and marine resources.
33. The disclosure shall include:
(a) a quantification of the anticipated financial effects in monetary terms before considering water and marine
resources-related actions or where not possible without undue cost or effort, qualitative information. For
financial effects arising from opportunities, a quantification is not required if it would result in disclosure that
does not meet the qualitative characteristics of information (see ESRS 1 Appendix B Qualitative characteristics of
information);
(b) a description of the effects considered, the impacts and dependencies to which they relate, and the time horizons in which they are likely to materialise; and
(c) the critical assumptions used to quantify the anticipated financial effects, as well as the sources and level of uncertainty of those assumptions.

recycling”, 2. Weighted average percentage of water recycled and reused by investee companies).
