repor ting requirements. According ly, small and medium-sized under takings whose secur ities are admitt ed to trading
on a regulated market in the Union that are public-inte rest entities should be allowed to repor t in accordance with
the sustainability repor ting standards for small and medium-sized under takings. In addition, all under takings that
are parent under takings of large groups should prepare sustainability repor ting at group level. Moreover , since
Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 refers to Article 19a and Article 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU, the
under takings added to the scope of the sustainability repor ting requirements will also have to compl y with Article 8
of Regulation (EU) 2020/852.
(18) The requirement provided for in this amending Directive that also large under takings whose secur ities are not
admitte d to trading on a regulate d market in the Union should disclose information on sustainability matters is
mainly justified by concer ns about the impacts and accountability of such under takings, including through their
value chain. In this respect, all large under takings should be subject to the same requirements to repor t
sustainability information publicly . In addition, financial mark et participants also need information from those large
under takings whose secur ities are not admitte d to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union.
(19) The requirement provid ed for in this amending Directive that third-countr y under takings whose secur ities are
admitte d to trading on a regulate d market in the Union should also disclose information on sustainability matt ers is
aimed at responding to the needs of financial mark et participants for information from such under takings in order
to enable them to understand the risks and impacts of their investments and to compl y with the disclosure
requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088.
(20) Third-countr y under takings whic h have a signif icant activity on the territory of the Union should also be required to
provid e sustainability information, especially on their impa cts on social and environmental matt ers, in order to
ensure that third-countr y under takings are accountable for their impacts on people and the environment and that
there is a level playing field for compan ies operating in the internal market. Theref ore, third-countr y under takings
which generate a net turnover of more than EUR 150 million in the Union and which have a subsidiar y
under taking or a branch on the territory of the Union should be subject to Union sustainability repor ting
requirements. To ensure the propor tionality and enforceability of such requirements, the threshold of having a net
turnover of more than EUR 40 million should apply to the branch es of third-countr y under takings, and the
thresholds relat ed to being considered a large under taking or a small or medium-sized under taking, excep t micro
under takings, whose secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union should apply to the
subsidiar y under takings of third-countr y under takings, as such subsidiar y under takings and branche s should be
responsible for publishing the sustainability repor t of the third-countr y under taking. The sustainability repor ts
published by the subsidiar y under taking or branch of a third-countr y under taking should be prepared in
accordance with standards to be adopt ed by 30 June 2024 by the Commission through delegat ed acts.
The subsidiar y under taking or branch of a third-countr y under taking should also be able to repor t in accordance
with the standards applying to under takings established in the Union, or in accordance with standards which are
deemed equivalent pursuant to an imp lementing act. In the event that not all the information required under this
amending Directive is provid ed by the third-countr y under taking, despite the best efforts of the subsidiar y
under taking or branch of that third-countr y under taking to obtain the necessar y information, that subsidiar y
under taking or branch should provid e all the information in its possession and issue a statement indicating that the
