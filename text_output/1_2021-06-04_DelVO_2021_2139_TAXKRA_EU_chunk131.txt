(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the 
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set in the latest relevant best
available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including the best available tech ­
niques (BAT) conclusions for large combustion plants (  201  ). No significant 
cross-media effects occur.
For combustion plants with thermal input greater than 1 MW but below
the thresholds for the BAT conclusions for large combustion plants to
apply, emissions are below the emission limit values set out in Annex II,
part 2, to Directive (EU) 2015/2193.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
4.24.  Production of heat/cool from bioenergy  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of facilities that produce heat/cool exclusively from biomass, biogas or bioliquids, and
excluding production of heat/cool from blending of renewable fuels with biogas or bioliquids (see Section 4.23 of
this Annex.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code D35.30 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. Agricultural biomass used in the activity for the production of heat and cool complies with the criteria laid
down in Article 29, paragraphs 2 to 5, of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Forest biomass used in the activity
complies with the criteria laid down in Article 29, paragraphs 6 and 7, of that Directive.
2. The greenhouse gas emission savings from the use of biomass are at least 80 % in relation to the GHG
emission saving methodology and relative fossil fuel comparator set out in Annex VI to Directive (EU)
2018/2001.
3. Where the installations rely on anaerobic digestion of organic material, the production of the digestate
meets the criteria in Sections 5.6 and criteria 1 and 2 of Section 5.7 of this Annex, as applicable.
4. Points 1 and 2 do not apply to heat generation installations with a total rated thermal input below 2 MW
and using gaseous biomass fuels.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.
