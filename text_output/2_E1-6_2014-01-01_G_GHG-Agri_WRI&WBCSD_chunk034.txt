 Table 7-1.  Types of activity data that may be needed to calculat e GHG fluxes to/from on-
farm sources. Note that some calculation tool s may have data requirements that are not
reflected here and that not all types of activ ity data may be required for a given source.  
Source Common types of activity data needed
General  Soil texture, moisture, drainage and pH
 Temperature
 Area of different types of crops harvested and crop yield by crop
 Location (e.g., state or biome)
Enteric fermentation  Livestock numbers by age and type (e.g., calves, bulls, heifers, cows),
disaggregated by season or month
 Length of juvenile, adult productio n and adult non-production phases
 Number of livestock managed off-site (e.g., off-site wintering, feedlots,
ajistments)
 Sales and purchases of animals  
 Amount, type  and digestibility of feed  
 Quality of forage in pastures or open grazing systems
 Amount of time livestock were grazed
 Dry matter intake per head  
 Type and amount of feed additives
Manure management  Type of management system  
 Amount of manure managed in this system
 Number of days system used
Application of
synthetic fertilizers, livestock waste and
crop residues to soils  Type of fertilizer/farm waste and N content (e.g., %N/kg or liter)
 Application rate (e.g., kg/ha)
 Application method (e.g., broadcast, incorporated, etc.)
 Dates of applications
 Amount of crop residue returned to soil (including from crop rotations)
 Amounts of exported/imported manure
Drainage and tillage
of managed soils  Types of tilling practices  
 Years tilling practices were changed
 Area of cropland for which tilling practices were changed
 Area of organic soil (e.g., peat, fen) drained to different depths
 Soil organic matter (SOM) content
Rice cultivation  Crop acreage
Open burning of
crop residues  Acres burnt  
 Amount of crop residue left on field per acre
Land use change  Land types and species concerned (e.g., type of woodland)
 Area of land concerned
 Year land use change occurred   
Woodland
management (e.g.,
short-rotation woody
crop plantations)  Volume of harvested wood  
 Volume of woody detritus left on-site

Fuel use in mobile
and stationary
equipment   Amounts of different types of fuels used, or 

 Starting and ending volumes of different fuel stocks, and
 Amounts of different types of fuels purchased
For contractor operations:
 Hours of different types of machinery operated by contractors (e.g.,
<150 hp, 150-200 hp, etc.)  
 Acres of cropland contracted  
Electricity use  Amount of purchased electricity
 Amount of electricity from on-farm renewable energy sources, used on-
farm or sold to the grid
Refrigeration or air-
conditioning  Amount of products refrigerated  
 Starting and ending volumes of different refrigerant stocks
 Amounts of different types of refrigerants purchased
