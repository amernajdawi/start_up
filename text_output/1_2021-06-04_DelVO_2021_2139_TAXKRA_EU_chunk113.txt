2. Where facilities incorporate any form of abatement (including carbon capture or use of decarbonised fuels),
that abatement activity complies with the criteria set out in the relevant Section of this Annex, where applicable.
Where the CO  2 that would otherwise be emitted from the electricity generation process is captured for the 
purpose of underground storage, the CO  2 is transported and stored underground, in accordance with the 
technical screening criteria set out in Sections 5.11 and 5.12 of this Annex.
3. The activity meets either of the following criteria:
(a) at construction, measurement equipment for monitoring of physical emissions, such as methane leakage is
installed or a leak detection and repair program is introduced;
(b) at operation, physical measurement of methane emissions are reported and leak is eliminated.
4. Where the activity blends renewable gaseous or liquid fuels with biogas or bioliquids, the agricultural
biomass used for the production of the biogas or bioliquids complies with the criteria laid down in Article 29,
paragraphs 2 to 5, of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 while forest biomass complies with the criteria laid down in
Article 29, paragraphs 6 and 7, of that Directive.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the 
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the latest relevant
best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including the best available
techniques (BAT) conclusions for large combustion plants (  170  ). 
No significant cross-media effects occur.
For combustion plants with thermal input greater than 1 MW but below
the thresholds for the BAT conclusions for large combustion plants to
apply, emissions are below the emission limit values set out in Annex II,
part 2, to Directive (EU) 2015/2193 of the European Parliament and of
the Council (  171  ). 
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
4.8.  Electricity generation from bioenergy  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of electricity generation installations that produce electricity exclusively from biomass,
biogas or bioliquids, excluding electricity generation from blending of renewable fuels with biogas or bioliquids
(see Section 4.7 of this Annex).

( 170  ) Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/1442 of 31 July 2017 establishing best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, 
under Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, for large combustion plants (OJ L 212, 17.8.2017,
p. 1).  
( 171  ) Directive (EU) 2015/2193 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on the limitation of emissions of
