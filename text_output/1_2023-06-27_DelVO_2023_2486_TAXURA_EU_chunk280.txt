4.For the treatment of aqueous liquid waste, the biological treatability of the waste water resulting from the treatment of
the water-based liquid waste in a biological waste water treatment plant is judged based on the following criterion:
Dissolved Organic Carbon DOC elimination of > 70 % in 7 days (> 80 % when adapted inoculum is used) in accordance
with EN ISO 9888 (52)(Zahn Wellens), or other commonly accepted, equivalent industry standards and methodologies
used to assess bio-elimination and related performances.
5.For the treatment of waste containing Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP), all waste containing POP substances listed in
Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 are controlled and traced as hazardous waste in accordance with Article 17 of
Directive 2008/98/EC. Specific requirements of Articles 7(4), 17, 18 and 19 of Directive 2008/98/EC apply. In case of
