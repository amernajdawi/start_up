(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.
The new construction is not built on one of the following:
(a) arable land and crop land with a moderate to high level of soil fertility
and below ground biodiversity as referred to in the EU LUCAS
survey (  579  ); 
(b) greenfield land of recognised high biodiversity value and land that
serves as habitat of endangered species (flora and fauna) listed on
the European Red List (  580  ) or the IUCN Red List (  581  ); 
(c) land matching the definition of forest as set out in national law used
in the national greenhouse gas inventory, or where not available, is in
accordance with the FAO definition of forest (  582  ). 
7.2.  Renovation of existing buildings  
Description of the activity  
Construction and civil engineering works or preparation thereof.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular F41 and F43 in
accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.
The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan,
such that:
(a) for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using
climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale;
(b) for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state-of-the-art
climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios (  583  ) consistent with the expected lifetime 
of the activity, including, at least, 10 to 30 year climate projections scenarios for major investments.
