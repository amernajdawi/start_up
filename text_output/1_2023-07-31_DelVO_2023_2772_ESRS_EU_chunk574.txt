Application Requirements
This appendix is an integral part of the ESRS S4 Consumers and end-users. It supports the application of the requirements set
out in this standard and has the same authority as the other parts of the standard.
ObjectiveAR 1. The undertaking may highlight special issues relevant to a material impact for a shorter period of time, for instance

AR 2. The overview of social and human rights matters provided in paragraph 2 is not meant to imply that all of these
issues should be disclosed in each Disclosure Requirement in this Standard. Rather, it provides a list of matters

disclose as material impacts, risks and opportunities within the scope of this Standard.

undertaking may disclose the views of the (actual or potential) materially affected consumers and/or end-users’
legitimate representatives or those of credible proxies that have insight into their situation.
