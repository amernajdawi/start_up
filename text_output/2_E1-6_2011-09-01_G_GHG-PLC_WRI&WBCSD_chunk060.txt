[74]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard
guidanceAs defined in chapter 7, the boundary of a cradle-to-
gate inventory does not include the use or end-of-
life stages. If an intermediate product has recycled
inputs, companies can use the recycled content
method and account for the material recovery
facility (MRF) and recycling process emissions and
removals for that input. If an intermediate product
is known to be recycled at its end-of-life regardless
of its function during use, companies may report
this separately in the inventory report along with
any other end-of-life information that may be
useful to a stakeholder. Companies may include
end-of-life recycling in the inventory results for an
intermediate product only if the company knows
the function of the final product and performs a
cradle-to-grave inventory.  Box [9.3] Recycling in a cradle-to-gate inventory9.3.7  Choosing between closed loop 
approximation and the recycled  
content method
In cases where both the closed loop approximation and
recycled content methods are equally applicable to the
studied product, the following guidance provides insight
on which method is most appropriate in certain situations.
The recycled content method should be used in the
following situations:
•When the product contains recycled input, but no
recycling occurs downstream
•When the market for the recycled material is saturated
(e.g., not all material that is recovered is used as a
recycled input, supply exceeds demand) and therefore
the creation of recycled material may not displace the
extraction of virgin material
•When the content of recycled material in the product
is directly affected by the company’s activities alone,
and therefore the company has control over how
much recycled material input to procure (which could
potentially be used as a reduction mechanism)
•The time period of the product’s use stage is long and/
or highly uncertain and therefore the amount of material
recycled at the end-of-life is also highly uncertain
The closed loop approximation method should be used in
the following situations:
•When the recycled content of the product is unknown
because recycled material is indistinguishable from
virgin material in the market
•When the market for the recycled material is not
saturated (e.g., all material that is recovered is used
as a recycled input, demand exceeds supply) and
therefore creating more recycled material is likely to
increase the amount of recycled material used
•When the time period of the product’s use stage is
short and/or well knownThere may be situations where a company feels neither
method is appropriate for a given recycled material
input or output. In these cases the method used should
abide by the specifications given in the requirements
section and be referenced from available sector guidance,
product rules, technical reports, journal articles, or
other standards. For example, companies with paper
products may want to use the “number of subsequent
uses” method recommended by the American Forest
and Paper Association for recycling cellulosic fiber in
paper products.12 Another company may feel economic
allocation is more appropriate for its product’s inventory
and therefore reference ISO 14049:2000.13 If a company
is using a method that is not published, the company is
strongly encouraged to include details on the method,
either in the inventory report or as a supplementary
document, and to have the method externally verified to
ensure its conformance with this standard.
When it is not obvious which method is most appropriate,
companies should perform a scenario uncertainty
assessment (e.g., sensitivity analysis) on the potential
methods and include the results in the inventory report
(see chapter 10 for more information on uncertainty).
