11.2  Requirements
Companies shall apply a 100 year global
warming potential (GWP) factor to GHG
emissions and removals data to calculate
the inventory results in units of CO2
equivalent (CO2e). Companies shall report
the source and date of the GWP factor used.
The global warming potential (GWP) is a metric used to
calculate the cumulative radiative forcing impact of
multiple GHGs in a comparable way. When emissions
or removals are multiplied by their respective GWP,
they become CO2 equivalents (CO2e). Companies
should use GWP values from the Intergovernmental
Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment
Report, published in 2007, or the most recent IPCC
values when the Fourth Assessment Report is no longer
current. Although the IPCC provides GWP metrics for
different time periods (e.g., 20 and 500 years), 100 years
is used most often by programs and policies as the
median metric and therefore shall be used to calculate
inventory results in this standard. Companies shall quantify and report the
total inventory results in CO2e per unit of
analysis, which includes all emissions and
removals included in the boundary from
biogenic sources, non-biogenic sources,  
and land-use change impacts.
Once data collection, allocation, and data quality
assessments are complete, companies shall quantify
and report the total inventory results in CO2e per unit  
of analysis (e.g., functional unit). For more information
on the unit of analysis please refer to chapter 6.

[86]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard
requirements
In addition to the total inventory results,
companies shall quantify and report:
 • Percentage of total inventory results  
by life cycle stage
 •	Biogenic	and	non-biogenic	emissions	and 	
removals separately when applicable
• Land-use change impacts separately
when applicable
• Cradle-to-gate and gate-to-gate
inventory results separately or a clear
statement	that	confidentiality	is	a 	
limitation to providing this information
Separately calculating and reporting these components of
the inventory results adds transparency to the product’s
life cycle and provides companies and their stakeholders with a better understanding of what type of emissions
and removals dominate the inventory and where they
occur along the life cycle.
Companies shall not include the following
when quantifying inventory results:
•Weighting factors for delayed emissions
•Offsets
•Avoided emissions
In a life cycle, particularly for products that have long
use and end-of-life time periods, emissions may occur
at different points in time and have different impacts
on the atmosphere. Some methodologies try to capture
this in the life cycle results by applying a weighting
factor to account for emissions delayed over time (also
