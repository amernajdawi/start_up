8.1 Introduction
Data collection can be the most resource intensive step when performing a product GHG
inventory. Data can also have a significant impact on the overall inventory quality.
This chapter provides requirements and guidance to help companies successfully
collect and assess the quality of their inventory data.  
8.2 Requirements
Companies shall collect data for all processes
included in the inventory boundary.
Companies shall collect primary data for all
processes under their ownership or control.
Primary data are data collected from specific processes
in the studied product’s life cycle. Primary data can be
process activity data (physical measures of a process
that results in GHG emissions or removals), direct
emissions data (determined through direct monitoring,
stoichiometry, mass balance, or similar methods) from
a specific site, or data that is averaged across all sites
that contain the specific process. Primary data can be
measured or modeled, as long as the result is specific to
the process in the product’s life cycle. It is important to
note that using the reference flow of the studied product
(e.g., mass of finished product) as process activity data is
not considered primary data. Allocated data are considered primary data as long as the
data meets the other primary data requirements.
During the data collection process,
companies shall assess the data quality
of activity data, emission factors, and/
or direct emissions data by using the data
quality indicators.
Activity data are quantified measures of a level of activity
that results in GHG emissions or removals. Emission
factors are GHG emissions per unit of activity data. Direct
emissions data are data on emissions released from a
process (or removals absorbed from the atmosphere)
determined through direct monitoring, stoichiometry,
mass balance, or similar methods (see section 8.3.4 for
more details on data types).
