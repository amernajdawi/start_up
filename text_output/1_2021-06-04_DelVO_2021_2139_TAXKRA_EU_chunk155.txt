(d) where technologically and economically not feasible to comply with the criterion in point (a), until
31 December 2025, the vessels have an attained Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) value 10 % below
the EEDI requirements applicable on 1 April 2022 (  247  ) if the vessels are able to run on zero direct (tailpipe) 
CO  2 emission fuels or on fuels from renewable sources (  248  ). 
2. Vessels are not dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Measures are in place to manage waste, both in the use phase and in the 
end-of-life of the vessel, in accordance with the waste hierarchy.
For battery-operated vessels, those measures include reuse and recycling of
batteries and electronics, including critical raw materials therein.
