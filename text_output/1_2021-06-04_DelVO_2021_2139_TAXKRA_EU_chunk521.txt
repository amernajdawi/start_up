Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  The activity manufactures one of the following: 
(a) primary aluminium where the economic activity complies with two of
the following criteria until 2025 and with all of the following crite ­
ria (  137  ) after 2025: 
(i) the GHG emissions do not exceed 1,604 (  138  ) tCO  2 e per ton of 
aluminium manufactured (  139  ); 
(ii) the indirect GHG emissions do not exceed 270 g CO  2 e/kWh; 
(iii) the electricity consumption for the manufacturing process does
not exceed 15,5 MWh/t Al;
(b) secondary aluminium.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix C to this 
Annex.
Emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the latest relevant
best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including the best available
techniques (BAT) conclusions for the non-ferrous metals industries (  140  ). 
No significant cross-media effects occur.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
3.9.  Manufacture of iron and steel  
Description of the activity  
Manufacture of iron and steel.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular C24.10,
C24.20, C24.31, C24.32, C24.33, C24.34, C24.51 and C24.52 in accordance with the statistical classification
of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
