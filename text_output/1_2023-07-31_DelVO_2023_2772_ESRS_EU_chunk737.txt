Physical risks All global economic enterprise depends on the functioning of earth systems,
such as a stable climate and on ecosystem services, such as the provision of
biomass (raw materials). Nature-related physical risks are a direct result of
an organisation’s dependence on nature. Physical risks arise when natural
systems are compromised, due to the impact of climatic events (e.g., extremes of weather such as a drought), geologic events (e.g., seismic
events such as an earthquake) events or changes in ecosystem equilibria,
such as soil quality or marine ecology, which affect the ecosystem services
