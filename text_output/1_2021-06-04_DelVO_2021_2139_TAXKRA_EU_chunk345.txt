3. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and
take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line
with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports (  428  ), scientific peer-reviewed 
publications and open source (  429  ) or paying models. 
4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people,
of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  430  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  431  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  N/A  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  N/A  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  N/A  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
5.10.  Landfill gas capture and utilisation  
Description of the activity  
Installation and operation of infrastructure for landfill (  432  ) gas capture and utilisation in permanently closed 
landfills or landfill cells using new or supplementary dedicated technical facilities and equipment installed
during or post landfill or landfill cell closure.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code E38.21 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.

( 430  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta neously 
provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nat ure
and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and syste mic
interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosystem service s
