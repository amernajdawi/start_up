The
GHG Protocol Corporate Standard has developed a
supplementary guidance document on uncertainty assess-ments (“Guidance on uncertainty assessment in GHGinventories and calculating statistical parameter uncer-tainty”) along with an uncertainty calculation tool, bothof which are available on the GHG Protocol website. Theguidance document describes how to use the calculationtool in aggregating uncertainties. It also discusses inmore depth different types of uncertainties, the limita-tions of quantitative uncertainty assessment, and howuncertainty estimates should be properly interpreted.
Additional guidance and information on assessing
uncertainty—including optional approaches to devel-oping quantitative uncertainty estimates and eliciting
judgments from experts— can also be found in EPA'sEmissions Inventory Improvement Program, Volume VI:Quality Assurance/Quality Control (1999) and in chapter 6 of the IPCC’s Good Practice Guidance (2000a).GUIDANCEManaging Inventory Quality
