(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  For biogas production, a gas-tight cover on the digestate storage is applied. 
For anaerobic digestion plants treating over 100 tonnes per day, emissions
to air and water are within or lower than the emission levels associated
with the best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set for anaerobic
treatment of waste in the latest relevant best available techniques (BAT)
conclusions, including the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for
waste treatment (  308  ). No significant cross-media effects occur. 
In case of anaerobic digestion of organic material, where the produced
digestate is used as fertiliser or soil improver, either directly or after
composting or any other treatment, it meets the requirements for ferti ­
lising materials set out in Component Material Categories (CMC) 4 and 5
for digestate or CMC 3 for compost, as applicable, in Annex II to Regu ­
lation EU 2019/1009 or national rules on fertilisers or soil improvers for
agricultural use.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
4.14.  Transmission and distribution networks for renewable and low-carbon gases  
Description of the activity  
Conversion, repurposing or retrofit of gas networks for the transmission and distribution of renewable and low-
carbon gases.  
Construction or operation of transmission and distribution pipelines dedicated to the transport of hydrogen and
other low-carbon gases.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular D35.21, F42.21
and H49.50 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.
The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan,
such that:
(a) for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using
climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale;
