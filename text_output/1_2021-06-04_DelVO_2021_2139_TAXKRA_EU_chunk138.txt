5.5.  Collection and transport of non-hazardous waste in source segregated fractions  
Description of the activity  
Separate collection and transport of non-hazardous waste in single or comingled fractions (  213  ) aimed at preparing 
for reuse or recycling.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code E38.11 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
All separately collected and transported non-hazardous waste that is segregated at source is intended for
preparation for reuse or recycling operations.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  N/A  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Separately collected waste fractions are not mixed in waste storage and 
transfer facilities with other waste or materials with different properties.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  N/A  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  N/A  
5.6.  Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of facilities for the treatment of sewage sludge by anaerobic digestion with the
resulting production and utilisation of biogas or chemicals.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E37.00 and
F42.99 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. A monitoring and contingency plan is in place in order to minimise methane leakage at the facility.
2. The produced biogas is used directly for the generation of electricity or heat, or upgraded to bio-methane
for injection in the natural gas grid, or used as vehicle fuel or as feedstock in chemical industry.  
_____________
( 213  ) In the Union, the activity is in line with Article 10(3) of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Counci l of 
19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives (OJ L 312, 22.11.2008, p. 3) and the national legislation and
