(b) replacement of existing windows with new energy efficient windows;  
(c) replacement of existing external doors with new energy efficient doors;  
(d) installation and replacement of energy efficient light sources;  
(e) installation, replacement, maintenance and repair of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) and water
heating systems, including equipment related to district heating services, with highly efficient technologies;  
(f) installation of low water and energy using kitchen and sanitary water fittings which comply with technical
specifications set out in Appendix A to Annex I to this Regulation and in case of shower solutions, mixer
showers, shower outlets and taps have a max water flow of 6 L/min or less attested by an existing label in the
Union market.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular F42, F43, M71,
C16, C17, C22, C23, C25, C27, C28, S95.21, S95.22, C33.12 in accordance with the statistical classification of
economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.
The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan,
such that:
(a) for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using
climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale;
(b) for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state-of-the-art
climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios (  592  ) consistent with the expected lifetime
