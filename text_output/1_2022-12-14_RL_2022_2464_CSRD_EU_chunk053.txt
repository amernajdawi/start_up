(54) To meet the information needs of users in a timely manner , and in particular given the urgency to meet the
information needs of financial mark et participants subject to the requirements laid down in the delegat ed acts
adopt ed pursuant to Article 4(6) and (7) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, the Commission should adopt a first set of
sustainability repor ting standards by means of delegat ed acts by 30 June 2023 . That set of sustainability repor ting
standards should specify the information that under takings should disclose with regar d to all repor ting areas and
sustainability matte rs, and that financial mark et participants need to compl y with the disclosure obligations laid
down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. The Commission should adopt a second set of sustainability repor ting
standards by means of delega ted acts by 30 June 2024 , specifying compl ementar y information that under takings
should disclose about sustainability matte rs and repor ting areas, where necessar y, and information that is specif ic to
the sector in whic h an under taking operates. The Commission should review those sustainability repor ting
standards, including the sustainability repor ting standards for small and medium-sized under takings, ever y three
years to take account of relevant developments, including the development of intern ational standards.
(55) Directive 2013/34/EU does not require that under takings provid e their management repor ts in a digital format,
which hinders the findability and usability of the repor ted information. Users of sustainability information
increasing ly expect such information to be findable, compar able and mach ine-readable in digital formats. Member
State s should be able to require that under takings subject to the sustainability repor ting requirements of Directive
2013/34/EU make their manag ement repor ts available on their website s, free of charg e to the public. Digitalisation
creat es oppor tunities to exploit information more efficiently and holds the poten tial for signif icant cost savings for
both users and under takings. Digitalisation also enables the centralisation at Union and Member State level of data
in an open and accessible format that facilitates reading and allows for the comparison of data. Under takings should
theref ore be required to prepare their manag ement repor t in the electronic repor ting format specifi ed in Article 3 of
Commission Delegat ed Regulation (EU) 2019/815 (33), and to mark up their sustainability repor ting, including the
disclosures required by Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in accordance with the electronic repor ting format
specifi ed in Delegat ed Regulation (EU) 2019/815 once that is determined.
A digital taxonomy for the Union sustainability repor ting standards will be necessar y to allow the repor ted
information to be tagg ed in accordance with those sustainability repor ting standards. These requirements should
feed into the work on digitalisation announced by the Commission in its Communication of 19 Febr uary 2020
entitled ‘A European strategy for data’ and in its Communication of 24 Sept ember 2020 entitled ‘Digital Finance
Strateg y for the EU’. These requirements would also compl ement the creation of a European sing le access point
(ESAP) for public corporate information as envisaged in the Commission’s Communication of 24 Sept ember 2020
entitled ‘A Capital Mark ets Union for people and businesses - new action plan’ in which the need to provide
comparab le information in a digital format is also considered.
(56) To allow for the inclusion of the repor ted sustainability information in the ESA P, Member States should ensure that
under takings whose secur ities are not admitt ed to trading on a regulated market in the Union publish their
manage ment repor t, including sustainability repor ting, in the electronic repor ting format specifi ed in Article 3 of
Delegat ed Regulation (EU) 2019/815.
(57) Article 19a(4) of Directive 2013/34/EU enables Member States to exem pt under takings from including in the
manage ment repor t the non-f inancial state ment required under Article 19a(1) of that Directive. Member States are
