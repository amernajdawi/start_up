Table [C.2] Recommended quality assurance/quality control procedures
Activity Procedure
Data collection, input,  
and handling activities
• Transcription errors  
in data collection • Check a sample of input data in each process for transcription errors
• Uncertainty  
estimates• Check that the calculated uncertainties are complete and calculated correctly
Data documentation
• Transcription errors  
in references
and storage of all
references used• Confirm that bibliographical data in references are properly cited.
• Ensure that all relevant references are archived
• Storing information  
on inventory
methodology, data,  
and data quality• Check that inventory boundary, base inventory (if relevant), GHGs included,
allocation methodology uses, data sources, and any relevant assumptions are
documented and archived
• Check that all data quality indicators are described, documented, and archived for
each process
• Check for consistency in emissions sources and data sources to similar product
inventories
• Recording parameter  
and unit information• Check that all units are appropriately labeled in calculation sheets
• Check that all units are correctly transferred through all calculations and
aggregation of emissions in all processes
• Check that conversion factors are correct
• Check any temporal or spatial adjustment factors are appropriate and correctly used
• Recording calculation
methodologies• Check that all calculation methodologies are documented
• Check that any changes to calculation methodologies are documented
• Database/calculation
sheet integrity• Ensure all fields and their units are labeled in database/calculation sheet
• Ensure the database/calculation sheet is documented and the structure and
operating details of the database/calculations sheets are archived
• Review of internal
documentation and
archiving• Check there is sufficient internal documentation to support the estimates and
enable the reproduction of the emissions and data quality assessment, and
uncertainty estimations
• Check that all data, supporting data and records are archived and stored to
facilitate a detailed review
• Check that the archive is securely stored
