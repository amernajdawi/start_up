before they take place. Avoidance often involves a decision to deviate from the business-as-usual project development path. An example of avoidance is altering the biodiversity and ecosystem footprint of a project to
avoid destruction of natural habitat on the site and/or establishing set-asides where priority biodiversity values
are present and will be conserved. At a minimum, avoidance should be considered where there are biodiversity
and ecosystem-related values that are in one of the following categories: particularly vulnerable and irreplaceable,
of particular concern to stakeholders, or where a cautious approach is warranted due to uncertainty about impact
assessment or about the efficacy of management measures. The three main types of avoidance are defined below:
(a) avoidance through site selection (Locate the entire project away from areas recognised for important
biodiversity values);
(b) avoidance through project design (Configure infrastructure to preserve areas at the project site with important
biodiversity values); and
(c) avoidance through scheduling (Time project activities to account for patterns of species behaviour (e.g.,
breeding, migration) or ecosystem functions (e.g., river dynamics).OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
