ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 14/164(a) the activity closes the gap by at least 20 % either between the current leakage level averaged over three years, calculated
using the Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI) rating method and an ILI of 1,5 or between the current leakage level
averaged over three years, calculated using another appropriate method, and the threshold value established in
accordance with Article 4 of Directive (EU) 2020/2184. The current leakage level averaged over three years is
calculated across the extent of the affected and specified part of a water supply (distribution) network where the works
are carried out, i.e. for the renewed water supply (distribution) network at district metered area(s) (DMAs) or pressure
managed area(s) (PMAs);
(b) a plan with goals and timelines for implementing metering at consumer level is issued by the water supplier and
approved by the competent authorities.
4. The water supply system has received the necessary permits for water abstraction. Those abstractions are included in the register for water abstractions, in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC. An assessment of the actual potential
for abstraction has been performed, to ensure that the available groundwater resource is not exceeded by the long-
term annual average rate of abstraction or that the surface water body from which water is abstracted is not
prevented from achieving good ecological status and ecological potential and the abstractions do not deteriorate
status or potential of those water bodies.
The operation of the water supply system does not result in a deterioration of the status of the affected water bodies, nor
does it prevent the water body from achieving good status and good ecological potential in accordance with Directive
2000/60/EC (
5).
The information in relation to the abstractions, register of abstractions, status of water bodies and pressures and impacts on
these is included in a river basin management plan, or, for activities in third countries, in an equivalent water use and
protection management plan.
The activity does not involve construction of new supply systems or extensions of existing supply systems where they
potentially affect one or more water bodies which are not in good status or potential for reasons related to quantity.

(1) Climate change mitigation N/A

temsThe activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this Annex.
(5)For activities in third countries, in accordance with applicable national law or international standards which pursue equivalent
objectives of good water status and good ecological potential, through equivalent procedural and substantive rules, i.e. a water use and
protection management plan developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders which ensures that (1) the impact of the activities
on the identified status or ecological potential of potentially affected water body or bodies is assessed; and (2) deterioration or
prevention of good status/ecological potential is avoided.OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
