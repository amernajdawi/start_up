of 28 Febr uary 2024
amending Directiv es 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU as regards empo wering consumers for the green
transition through better protection against unfair practices and through better information
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUR OPEAN UNION,
Havi ng regar d to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,
Havi ng regar d to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draf t legislative act to the national parliaments,
Havi ng regar d to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Acting in accordance with the ordinar y legislative procedure (2),
Whereas:
(1) In order to contr ibute to the proper functioning of the internal mark et, based on a high level of consumer prot ection
and environmental prote ction, and to make progress in the green transition, it is essential that consumers can make
informed purchas ing decisions and thus contr ibute to more sustainable consum ption patter ns. That implies that
traders have a responsibility to provide clear , relevant and reliable information. Theref ore, specifi c rules should be
introduced in Union consumer law to tackle unfai r commercial practices that mislead consumers and prevent them
from making sustainable consump tion choices, such as practices associated with the early obsolescence of goods,
misleading environmental claims (‘greenwashing’), misleading information about the social charact eristics of
products or traders’ businesses, or non-transparent and non-credible sustainability labels. Those rules will enable
compet ent national bodies to effectively address such practices. Ensur ing that environmental claims are fair,
understandable and reliable will allow traders to operate on a level playing field and will enable consumers to
choose products that are genuinely bette r for the environment than compet ing products. This will encourage
competition leading to more envi ronmentally sustainable products, thereby reducing the negative impact on the
environment.
(2) Those new rules should be introduced through amending Articles 6 and 7 of Directive 2005/29/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council (3)with regar d to commercial practices that are considered to be misleading, and
theref ore prohibit ed, on the basis of a case-by-case assessment, and through amending Annex I to
Directive 2005/29/EC, with the addition of specific misleading practices which are in all circumstances considered
unfai r, and theref ore prohibit ed. As already laid down in Directive 2005/29/EC, it should still be possible to
consider that a commercial practice is unfair on the basis of Articles 5 to 9 of that Directive, even though that
particular practice is not liste d as an unfai r commercial practice in Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC.
(3) In order for consumers to be empo wered to take bette r-informed decisions and thus stimulate the demand for, and
the supply of, more sustainable goods, they should not be misled about a product’ s environmental or social
character istics or circular ity aspects, such as durability , reparability or recy clability , through the overall presentation
of a product. Article 6(1) of Directive 2005/29/EC should theref ore be amended by adding environmental and social
(1)OJ C 443, 22.11.2022, p. 75.
(2)Position of the European Parliament of 17 Januar y 2024 (not yet published in the Official Jour nal) and decision of the Council of
20 Febr uary 2024.
(3)Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concer ning unfair business-to-co nsumer
commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC
