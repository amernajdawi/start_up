ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/825/oj 4/16(10) Recognised excellen t environmental performa nce can be demonstrated by compl iance with Regulation (EC)
No 66/2010 or with officially recognised EN ISO 14024 ecolabelling schemes in the Member State s, or by
corresponding to top environmental perf ormance for a specifi c environmental charact eristic in accordance with
other applicable Union laws, such as class A in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 of the European
Parliament and of the Council (9). The recognised excellent envi ronmental performa nce in question should be
relevant to the entire claim. For example, a gener ic envi ronmental claim such as ‘energy efficient’ could be made
based on recognised excellen t environmental performa nce in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1369. By
contrast, a generic environmental claim such as ‘biodegradable ’ could not be made based on recognised excellent
environmental performa nce in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 66/2010, insofa r as there are no requirements
for biodegradability in the specific EU Ecolabel criteria relat ed to the product in question. Similarly , a trader should
not make a gener ic claim such as ‘conscious’, ‘sustainable’ or ‘responsible’ based excl usively on recognised excellent
environmental performance, because such claims relat e to other characteri stics in addition to environmental
character istics, such as social charact eristics.
(11) Another misleading commercial practice, whic h should be prohibit ed in all circumstances and thus added to the list
in Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC, is making an environmental claim about the entire product or the trader ’s entire
business when it actually concer ns only a certain aspect of the product or a specific, unrepresentative activity of the
trader ’s business. That ban would apply , for exam ple, when a product is mark eted as ‘made with recy cled mater ial’
giving the impression that the entire product is made of recy cled mater ial, when in fact only the packaging is made
of recy cled mater ial, or when a trader gives the impression that it is only using renewable energy sources when in
fact several of the trader ’s business facilities still use fossil fuels. According ly, the ban should not prevent a trader
from making environmental claims about its entire business, provided that those claims are accurat e and verifiable
and that they do not overstat e the envi ronmental benefi t, such as would be the case in the second of those
examples , if that trader were to repor t a decrease in the use of fossil fuels for its business as a whole.
(12) It is particularly impor tant to prohibit the making of claims, based on the offsetting of greenhouse gas emissions,
that a product, either a good or service has a neutral, reduced, or positive impact on the environment in terms of
greenhouse gas emissions. Such claims should be prohibit ed in all circumstances and added to the list in Annex I to
Directive 2005/29/EC as they mislead consumers by making them believe that such claims relate to the product itself
or to the supply and production of that product, or as they give the false impression to consumers that the
consum ption of that product does not have an environmental impact. Examples of such claims are ‘climate neutral’ ,
‘CO 2 neutral certified’, ‘carbon positive’, ‘climate net zero’, ‘climate compen sated’ , ‘reduced climat e impact’ and
‘limit ed CO 2 footpr int’. Such claims should only be allowed when they are based on the actual lifecy cle impact of
the product in question, and not based on the offsetting of greenhouse gas emissions outside the product’ s value
chain, as the former and the latter are not equivalent. Such a prohibition should not prevent compan ies from
adver tising their investments in environmental initiatives, including carbon credit projects, as long as they provid e
such information in a way that is not misleading and that complies with the requirements laid down in Union law.
