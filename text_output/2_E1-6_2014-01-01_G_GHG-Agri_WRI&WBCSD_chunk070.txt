1. Sequestration in harvested woody products (HWPs) and herbaceous vegetation
The C contained in HWPs should not be include d in any reported values for the amount
of sequestration in above-ground woody biomas s stocks. Depending on how these values
have been calculated, this may mean that the amount of C in HWPs will have to be
subtracted from estimates of the total amount  of sequestration. This subtraction is 
necessary to ensure that i nventories do not over-estimate the net GHG benefits of woody
crop production.  
The biomass associated with annual and pere nnial herbaceous vegetation is relatively
ephemeral - reductions in these biomass stoc ks from harvesting, the burning of the crop
residues, or the integration of crop residues into soils, ar e balanced by stock increases
from plant re-growth over a period of only one  to a few years. Consequently, companies 
should also not report any sequestrati on in herbaceous biomass stocks.  

2. CO
2 fluxes to/from livestock
The carbon incorporated into animal tissues or  lost through animal respiration should not 
be reported in an inventory.  
Special note: Accounting for natural disturbances, conservation
areas, and payments for environmental services  
Natural  disturbances  are varied and include fires, windstorms, landslides, droughts, and 
pest outbreaks. Conservation areas  are lands where agricultural production has been 
limited or halted so as to provide environm ental benefits, such as maintaining or

improving water quality or wildlife habitat. Such areas may be established mandatorily,
to meet legal requirements for resource pr otection, or voluntarily, to contribute to the
public good and/or take advant age of financial incentives. Payments for Environmental
Services  (PESs) are incentives offered to fa rmers or landowners in exchange for 
managing their land to provide some sort of  ecological service. Box 8-1 shows some 
examples of conservation areas and PESs.
