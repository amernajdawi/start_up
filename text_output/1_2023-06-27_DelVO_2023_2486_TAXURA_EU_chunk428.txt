(g) in Section 1.2.1.1, the sixth paragraph of point (i) is replaced by the following:
‘GAR L&A (for each environmental objective) = (1)(c)/(1)(a). Credit institutions shall disclose the GAR
based on CapEx and turnover KPIs and separately the part of the KPI that refers to enabling and transitional
activities, where relevant.’;
(h) in Section 1.2.1.1, point (ii), the third paragraph is replaced by the following:
‘For the purposes of point 2(c)(1), credit institutions shall consider the following:
(2)(c)(1)(a) the total gross carrying amount of exposures to environmentally sustainable bonds issued in
accordance with Union legislation. Current bond issuances qualified as green bonds by issuers whose use of
proceeds have to be invested in Taxonomy-eligible economic activities shall be assessed depending on the level
of Taxonomy-alignment of economic activities in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 or of projects financed, based on specific information provided by the issuer for an issuance. Credit institutions shall provide
transparency on the kind of economic activity that is being financed. Double counting is not allowed. Where
the same green bond can be relevant for two environmental objectives, credit institutions shall allocate it to the most relevant objective.
(2)(c)(1)(b) the gross carrying amount of debt securities invested in exposures where the use of proceeds is
known, including specialised lending exposures, to the extent that the activities financed are Taxonomy-
aligned economic activities. The assessment shall be based on specific information provided by the issuer for that issuance. Double counting is not allowed. Where the same specialised lending exposure can be relevant
for two environmental objectives, credit institutions shall allocate it to the most relevant objective. Credit
institutions shall provide transparency on the type of economic activity that is financed.’;
