controlled by the reporting company. This assessment allows a company to establish which operationsand sources cause direct and indirect emissions, and to decide which indirect emissions to includethat are a consequence of its operations. (Chapter 4)
Organic growth/decline Increases or decreases in GHG emissions as a result of changes in production output, product mix,
plant closures and the opening of new plants. (Chapter 5)
Organizational boundaries The boundaries that determine the operations owned or controlled by the reporting company,
depending on the consolidation approach taken (equity or control approach). (Chapter 3)
Outsourcing The contracting out of activities to other businesses. (Chapter 3, 4, 5)
Parameter uncertainty GHG quantification uncertainty associated with quantifying the parameters used as inputs to estima-
tion models. (Chapter 7)
Primary effects The specific GHG reducing elements or activities (reducing GHG emissions, carbon storage, or
enhancing GHG removals) that the project is intended to achieve. (Chapter 8)
Process emissions Emissions generated from manufacturing processes, such as the CO
2that is arises from the break-
down of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) during cement manufacture. (Chapter 4, Appendix D)
Productivity/efficiency ratios Ratios that express the value or achievement of a business divided by its GHG impact. Increasing effi-
ciency ratios reflect a positive performance improvement. e.g. resource productivity(sales per tonneGHG). Productivity/efficiency ratios are the inverse of intensity ratios. (Chapter 9)
Ratio indicator Indicators providing information on relative performance such as intensity ratios or productivity/effi-
ciency ratios. (Chapter 9)
