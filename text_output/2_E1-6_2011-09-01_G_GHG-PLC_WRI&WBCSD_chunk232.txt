Appendix	B.	 Land-Use Change Impacts  
B.2.1			Estimating	significance	  
for land-use change impacts
When specific land data are not available, companies may
also chose to estimate the potential significance of land-
use impacts on their products to determine if a justifiable
exclusion is appropriate. For example, a product that uses
a bio-based polymer as an input could estimate the impact
of land-use change assuming the worst case scenario (e.g.,
all comes from land that was converted from natural forest)
and determine whether this is insignificant, applying the
same rules as described in chapter 7.  If land-use impacts are 
deemed significant using this estimation, the company can
either include the worst case values in the report or go back
and try to estimate the potential impact using statistical
data.  If land-use impacts are insignificant, then this should 
be included as a justifiable exclusion in the inventory report.  
B.3	 Soil	carbon	
When land-use change occurs, some of the carbon stock
change that results is due to changes in the carbon stock of
the soil. For example, converting natural land to cultivated
land reduces the amount of carbon the soil can store.  The 
IPCC factors for calculating carbon stock changes due to
land-use change include estimates of soil carbon change.
However, soil carbon loss can continue even after land-use
change as a result of land-use practices such as harvesting
and fertilizer application. On the other hand, switching land-
use practices can improve the carbon stock of soil, resulting
in CO2 removal.  Companies may include soil carbon change 
as a result of land-use practices in their inventory results
if they are able to reasonably estimate the emissions or
removals.  Companies should report whether the soil carbon 
change is included in the inventory results.
