ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 65/1645.The operator of the activity uses electronic tools to describe the characteristics of the building as built, including the
materials and components used, for the purpose of future maintenance, recovery, and reuse, for example using EN ISO
22057:2022 to provide Environmental Product Declarations (140). The information is stored in a digital format and is made
available to investors and clients on demand. In addition, the operator ensures the long-term preservation of this information beyond the useful life of the building by using the information managing systems provided by national tools,
such as cadastre or public register.
6.Bridges, tunnels, dikes and sluices are inspected regularly by a nationally approved inspector and the data is used to
predict maintenance needs.
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)
(1) Climate change mitigation The built asset is not dedicated to the extraction, storage, transport or manufacture of
fossil fuels.
For the cement used in this activity, the greenhouse gas emissions (
141)from the
production processes are:(a) for grey cement clinker, lower than 0,816 (
142)tCO 2e per tonne of grey cement
clinker;
(b) for cement from grey clinker or alternative hydraulic binder, lower than 0,530 (143)
tCO 2e per tonne of cement or alternative binder manufactured.
(2) Climate change adaptation The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.
(3) Sustainable use and protec ­
tion of water and marine
resourcesThe activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.

(142)Reflecting the median value of the installations in 2016 and 2017 (t CO 2 equivalents/t) of the data collected in the context of
establishing the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/447, determined on the basis of verified information on the
greenhouse gas efficiency of installations reported pursuant to Article 11 of Directive 2003/87/EC.
(143)Reflecting the median value of the installations in 2016 and 2017 (t CO 2 equivalents/t) of the data collected for grey cement clinker
in the context of establishing the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/447, multiplied by the clinker to cement ratio
(0,65), determined on the basis of verified information on the greenhouse gas efficiency of installations reported pursuant to
Article 11 of Directive 2003/87/EC.OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
