AppendicesThis appendix provides guidance on identifying when land-use change impacts are
attributable to the studied product. If they are attributable, guidance is also included
for calculating and allocating those impacts.1
For studied products whose life cycle includes biogenic
materials (materials produced by living organisms
or biological processes, not fossilized or from fossil
sources), attributable processes associated with those
materials include emissions and removals associated
with agricultural and forestry practices such as growth,
fertilizer application, cultivation, and harvesting.  In 
addition to these agricultural and forestry practices,
land-use change impacts may be attributable to a studied
product’s material acquisition and preprocessing stage.  
Land-use change impacts2 include the following:
•Biogenic CO2 emissions and removals due to carbon
stock change occurring as a results of land conversion
within or between land-use categories
•Biogenic and non-biogenic CO2, N2O, and CH4
emissions resulting from the preparation of converted
land, such as biomass burning or liming3
This appendix provides guidance for two situations: when
the specific land that the product or product component
originates from is known, and when it is not.  The 
concepts of assessment period, amortization period, and
distribution of impacts are used across both situations.
It is important to note that while this appendix focuses
on agricultural and forest products, significant land-use
change impacts are not limited to biogenic products.
Any company with a studied product that uses a large
amount of land, such as a new settlement, should
use this guidance to determine whether the land use
changed within the assessment period and whether
that had any impact on the area’s carbon stocks.
As referenced in chapter 7, companies are required to
disclose the method used to calculate land-use change
impacts in the inventory report.
