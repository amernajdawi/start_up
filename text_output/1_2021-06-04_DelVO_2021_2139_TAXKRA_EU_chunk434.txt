4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people,
of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  647  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  648  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.
5. In order for an activity to be considered as an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1), point (b), of
Regulation (EU) 2020/852, the economic operator demonstrates, through an assessment of current and future
climate risks, including uncertainty and based on robust data, that the activity provides a technology, product,
service, information, or practice, or promotes their uses with one of the following primary objectives:
(a) increasing the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of
assets and of other economic activities;
(b) contributing to adaptation efforts of other people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other
economic activities.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  N/A  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  N/A  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  N/A  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  N/A  
12.  HUMAN HEALTH AND SOCIAL WORK ACTIVITIES  
12.1.  Residential care activities  
Description of the activity  
Provision of residential care combined with either nursing, supervisory or other types of care as required by the
residents. Facilities are a significant part of the production process and the care provided is a mix of health and
social services with the health services being largely some level of nursing services.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code Q87 in accordance with the statistical
classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.  
_____________
( 647  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta neously 
provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse,
nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient an d
systemic interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosyste m
services (version of 4.6.2021: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/nature-based-solutio ns_
en/).
