Table 7-2. Common challenges in collecting activ ity data for agricultural emissions
sources  
Challenge Solution
Determining the number of head on the
farm per year, when livestock numbers and
categories vary a lot over the year (e.g.,
with spring and autumn calving there is a
wide spectrum of ages of livestock on the
farm)  Calculate emissions on a monthly basis  
Obtaining data for calculating the emissions
from contractor fuel use on farms, when only the contracted area is recorded Make assumptions about the amount of
fuel needed per area se rviced, as well as
the machinery employed  
Understanding the energy consumption of
individual facilities or sources (e.g., an
irrigation pump) Install meters or provide a use log that
tabulates the number of hours per day of
operation  
Determining the amount of crop residues burnt on fields Determine the total amount of above-
ground biomass grown over the reporting period, then subtract the fractions removed
before burning due to animal consumption, decay in the field, and harvesting (for biofuels, domestic livestock feed or other use).

7.2 Guidance for prioritizing data collection efforts

It may not always be possible to collect high quality activity data for all of the emissions
sources that need to be incl uded in an inventory. As a re sult, data collection efforts
should be prioritized.

Companies  should prioritize data collection efforts for key sources 
Key sources are those that are expected to have the highest GHG fl uxes, offer the most
emissions reduction potential, and are most relevant to the company’s business goals
(Table 7-3). The identification of key sour ces should take into account the range of
different GHGs emitted from individual sources, because of the potential for trade-offs in
GHG fluxes (see Chapter 7.3) and also because companies might have different amounts
of control over the different sources. Collect ing higher quality data for key sources will
allow companies to more effectively set re duction targets and track and demonstrate
progress over time, while making the most e fficient use of available resources. For the
same reasons, the key sources should also be  subject to the most accurate quantification 
methods and the focus of quality anal ysis/quality control procedures.  
 Table 7-3.  Criteria for prioritizing data collection efforts  
Criterion
Application to source (or sink)
Magnitude of
GHG flux The source (or sink) is large (or believed to be large) relative to most other
sources  
Trends in
magnitude There is a documented increase or decrease in the size of the source over time
or a projected trend based on project ed changes in agricultural practices  
Uncertainty of
GHG flux
estimates The uncertainty of the GHG fluxes is (or is believed to be) large
Degree of
control There are potential emissions reducti ons that could be undertaken or
influenced by the reporting company  
Risk  The source contributes to the company’s risk exposure (e.g., climate change 
related risks such as financial, regulatory, supply chain, product and
customer, litigation, and reputational risks)  
Stakeholders The source is deemed critical by key stakeholders (e.g., customers, suppliers,
investors or civil society)
Sector Guidance The source has been identified as si gnificant by sector-specific guidance
Other  The source meets any additional criteria developed by the company or sector 

Identifying key sources based on the m agnitude of GHG fluxes is preferred  
The most rigorous approach to identifying key sources is to use quantitative data to rank
the size of different sources (and sink s). This approach has three steps:
1. Obtain GHG flux data. Preferentially, comp anies would use data from the latest
available inventory, although cer tain sources will fluctuate in magnitude from one
inventory period to another. Altern atively, companies may use initial GHG
estimation (or screening) methods to estimate the fluxes for each source (e.g., by
