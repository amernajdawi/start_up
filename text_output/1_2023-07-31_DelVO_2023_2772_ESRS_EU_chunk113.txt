Metrics and targets
Disclosure Requirement E2-3 – Targets related to pollution
20. The undertaking shall disclose the pollution-related targets it has set.
21. The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to enable an understanding of the targets the undertaking has set to
support its pollution-related policies and to address its material pollution-related impacts, risks and opportunities.
22. The description of targets shall contain the information requirements defined in ESRS 2 MDR-T Tracking effectiveness
of policies and actions through targets.
23. The disclosure required by paragraph 20 shall indicate whether and how its targets relate to the prevention and
control of:
(a) air pollutants and respective specific loads;
(b) emissions to water and respective specific loads;
(c) pollution to soil and respective specific loads; and
(d) substances of concern and substances of very high concern.
24. In addition to ESRS 2 MDR-T, the undertaking may specify whether ecological thresholds (e.g., the biosphere
integrity , stratospheric ozone-depletion, atmospheric aerosol loading, soil depletion, ocean acidification) and entity-
specific allocations were taken into consideration when setting targets. If so, the undertaking may specify:
(a) the ecological thresholds identified, and the methodology used to identify such thresholds;
(b) whether or not the thresholds are entity-specific and if so, how they were determined; and
(c) how responsibility for respecting identified ecological thresholds is allocated in the undertaking.
25. The undertaking shall specify as part of the contextual information, whether the targets that it has set and presented
are mandatory (required by legislation) or voluntary.
Disclosure Requirement E2-4 – Pollution of air, water and soil
26. The undertaking shall disclose the pollutants that it emits through its own operations, as well as the
microplastics it generates or uses.
27. The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to provide an understanding of the emissions that the undertaking
generates to air, water and soil in its own operations, and of its generation and use of microplastics.
28. The undertaking shall disclose the amounts of:
(a) each pollutant listed in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the

derived from: (a) an additional indicator related to principal adverse impacts as set out by indicator #2 in Table II of Annex I of
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 with regard to disclosure rules on sustainable investments (“Emissions of air
pollutants”); (b) indicator #8 in Table I of Annex I (“Emissions to water); (c) indicator #1 in Table II of Annex I ( “Emissions of
inorganic pollutants”); and (d) indicator #3 in Table II of Annex I (“Emissions of ozone- depleting substances”) .OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
