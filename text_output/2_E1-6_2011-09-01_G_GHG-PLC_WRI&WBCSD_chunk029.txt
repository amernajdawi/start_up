CHAPTER 07 Boundary Setting
guidance •Mining and extraction of materials or fossil fuels
•Photosynthesis (e.g., removal of CO2 from the
atmosphere) for biogenic materials
•Cultivation and harvesting of trees or crops
•Application of fertilizer
•Preprocessing of material inputs to the studied
product, such as:
•Chipping wood
•Forming metals into ingots
•Cleaning coal
•Conversion of recycled material
•Preprocessing of intermediate material inputs
•Transportation to the production facility and within
extraction and preprocessing facilities
Production
The production stage starts when the product
components enter the production site of the studied product and ends when the finished studied product
leaves the production gate. Site and gate are figurative
terms, as a product may go through many processes
and corresponding intermediate facilities before exiting
the production stage as a finished product. Processes
associated with co-products or the treatment of wastes
formed during production may also be included in this
stage. Examples of attributable processes may include:
•Physical or chemical processing
•Manufacturing
•Transport of semi-finished products between
manufacturing processes
•Assembly of material components
•Preparation for distribution, e.g., packaging
•Treatment of waste created during production
Product distribution and storage
The product distribution and storage stage  starts when 
the finished studied product leaves the gate of the
production facility and ends when the consumer takes
possession of the product. Several legs of distribution
and storage may occur for one product, such as storage
at a distribution center and a retail location. Examples of
attributable processes may include:
•Distribution center or retail location operations
including:
•Receipt
•Put away
•Heating/refrigeration
•Shipping transportation
•Transportation between storage locations
Product use
The use stage begins when the consumer takes possession
of the product and ends when the product is discarded
for transport to a waste treatment location. The type
