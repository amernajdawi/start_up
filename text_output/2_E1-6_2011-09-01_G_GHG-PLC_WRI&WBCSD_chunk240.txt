6. Establish formal feedback loops to improve data
collection, handling, and documentation processes.
Feedback loops are needed to improve the quality
of the product inventory over time and to correct any
errors or inconsistencies identified in the review process.
7. Establish reporting, documentation, and archiving
procedures. Establish record-keeping processes for
what and how data should be stored over time, what
information should be reported as part of internal
and external inventory reports, and what should be
documented to support data collection and calculation
methodologies. The process may also involve aligning
or developing relevant database systems for record
keeping. Systems may take time to develop, and it is
important to ensure that all relevant information is
collected prior to the establishment of the system and
then transferred to the system once it is operational.
The data management plan is likely to be an evolving
document that is updated as data sources change,
data handling procedures are refined, calculation
methodologies improve, product inventory
responsibilities change within a company, or the business
objectives of the product inventory change.
Table C.1 outlines which components should be included
in a data management plan and can be used as a guide for
creating a plan or for pulling together existing documents
to constitute the plan.Appendix C. Data Management Plan
