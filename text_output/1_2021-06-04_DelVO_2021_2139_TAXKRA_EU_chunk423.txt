(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  N/A  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  N/A  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  N/A  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  N/A  
8.3.  Programming and broadcasting activities  
Description of the activity  
Programming and broadcasting activities include creating content or acquiring the right to distribute content and
subsequently broadcasting that content, such as radio, television and data programs of entertainment, news, talk,
and the like, including data broadcasting, typically integrated with radio or TV broadcasting. The broadcasting can
be performed using different technologies, over-the-air, via satellite, via a cable network or via Internet. This also
includes the production of programs that are typically narrowcast in nature (limited format, such as news, sports,
education, and youth-oriented programming) on a subscription or fee basis, to a third party, for subsequent
broadcasting to the public.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code J60 in accordance with the statistical
classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Where an economic activity in this category complies with the substantial contribution criterion specified in
point 5, the activity is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU)
2020/852, provided that it meets the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.EN  L 442/328 Official Journal of the European Union 9.12.2021
