izing impacts on sequestered atmospheric carbon alongthe value chain, this information can be included in the “optional information” section of the inventory (Seechapter 9). Information on sequestered carbon in thecompany’s inventory boundary should be kept separatefrom project-based reductions at sources that are not inthe inventory boundary. Where removal enhancementprojects take place within a company’s inventoryboundary they would normally show up as an increase incarbon removals over time, but can also be reported inoptional information. However, they should also be iden-tified separately to ensure that they are not doublecounted. This is especially important when they are soldas offsets or credits to a third party.
As companies develop experience using various
methods for characterizing impacts on sequesteredcarbon, more information will become available on thelevel of accuracy to expect from these methods. In theearly stages of developing this experience, however,companies may find it difficult to assess the uncer-tainty associated with the estimates and therefore mayneed to give special care to how the estimates arerepresented to stakeholders. 89 APPENDIX B
NOTES
1In this Appendix, “value chain” means a series of operations and
entities, starting with the forest and extending through end-of-lifemanagement, that (a) supply or add value to raw materials and inter-mediate products to produce final products for the marketplace and (b)are involved in the use and end-of-life management of these products.
2In this Appendix the term “sequestered atmospheric carbon” refersexclusively to sequestration by biological sinks.
