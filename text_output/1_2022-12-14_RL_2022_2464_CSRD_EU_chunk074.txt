(79) Directive 2004/109/EC assigns to national super visors the task of enforcing compl iance with corporat e repor ting
requirements by under takings whose secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union.
Article 4 of that Directive specifi es the content to be included in the annual financial repor ts, but lacks an explicit
referen ce to Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU, whic h require the preparation of a non-financial
state ment and a consolidated non-fi nancial statement. As a consequence, national compet ent author ities of some
Member States have no legal mandate to super vise those non-fi nancial statements, especially where those non-
financial statements are published in a separate repor t, outside of the annual financial repor t, whic h Member States
may currently allow . It is theref ore necessar y to inser t into Article 4(5) of Directive 2004/109/EC a referen ce to
sustainability repor ting. It is also necessar y to require that the persons responsible within the issuer confir m in the
annual financial repor t that, to the best of their kno wledge, the manage ment repor t is prepared in accordance with
the sustainability repor ting standards.
In addition, given the novel character of the sustainability repor ting requirements, ESMA should issue guidelines for
national compet ent author ities to promote converg ent super vision of sustainability repor ting by issuers subject to
Directive 2004/109/EC. Those guidelines should only apply to the super vision of under takings whose secur ities are
admitte d to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union.
(80) In order to specify the requirements set out in this amending Directive, the power to adopt acts in accordance with
Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delega ted to the Commission in
respect of establishing sustainability repor ting standards and establishing standards for the assurance of
sustainability repor ting. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropr iate consultations
during its preparatory work, including at exper t level, and that those consultations be conduct ed in accordance with
the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 Apr il 2016 on Bett er Law-Making (38). In
particular , to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegat ed acts, the European Parliament and the
Council receive all documents at the same time as Member Statesâ€™ exper ts, and their exper ts systematically have
access to meetings of Commission exper t groups dealing with the preparation of delegat ed acts.
(81) The Commission should submit a repor t to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of
this amending Directive, including, inter alia: an assessment of the achi evement of the goals of this amending
Directive, including the converg ence of repor ting practices between Member States; an assessment of the number of
small and medium-sized under takings using sustainability repor ting standards voluntar ily; an assessment of whether
and how the scope of the repor ting requirements should be further exte nded, in particular in relation to small and
medium-sized under takings and to third-countr y under takings operating directly on the Union internal mark et
without a subsidiar y under taking or a branch on the territory of the Union; an assessment of the implementation of
the repor ting requirements on subsidiar y under takings and branches of third-countr y under takings introduced by
this amending Directive, including an assessment of the number of third-countr y under takings whic h have a
subsidiar y under taking or a branch subject to repor ting requirements in accordance with Directive 2013/34/EU; an
assessment of the enforcement mechanis m and of the relevant thresholds set out in Directive 2013/34/EU; an
assessment of whether and how to ensure the accessibility for people with disabilities to the sustainability repor ting
published by under takings falling under the scope of this amending Directive.
The repor t on the implementation of this amending Directive should be published by 30 Apr il 2029 and ever y three
years thereaf ter, and should be accompanied , if appropr iate, by legislative proposals. By 31 December 2028 , the
