ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 105/284GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits
AR 61. Financing GHG emission reduction projects outside the undertakingâ€™s value chain through purchasing carbon
credits that fulfil high-quality standards can be a useful contribution towards mitigating climate change. This
Standard requires the undertaking to disclose whether it uses carbon credits separately from the GHG emissions
(paragraphs 56 (b) and 59) and GHG emission reduction targets (Disclosure Requirement E1-4). It also requires
the undertaking to show the extent of use and which quality criteria it uses for those carbon credits.
AR 62. When disclosing the information on carbon credits required under paragraphs 56 (b) and 59, the undertaking shall
disclose the following disaggregation as applicable:
(a) the share (percentage of volume) of reduction projects and removal projects;
(b) for carbon credits from removal projects, an explanation whether they are from biogenic or technological
sinks;
(c) the share (percentage of volume) for each recognised quality standard;
(d) the share (percentage of volume) issued from projects in the EU; and
(e) the share (percentage of volume) that qualifies as a corresponding adjustment under Article. 6 of the Paris
Agreement.
Calculation guidance
AR 63. When preparing the information on carbon credits required under paragraphs 56 (b) and 59, the undertaking
shall:
(a) Consider recognised quality standards;.
(b) if applicable, explain the role of carbon credits in its climate change mitigation policy ;
(c) not include carbon credits issued from GHG emission reduction projects within its value chain as the
respective GHG emission reductions shall already be disclosed under Disclosure Requirement E1-6 (Scope 2
or Scope 3) at the time they occur (i.e., double counting is avoided);
(d) not include carbon credits from GHG removal projects within its value chain as the respective GHG removals
may already be accounted for under Disclosure Requirement E1-7 at the time they occur (i.e., double counting
is avoided);
(e) not disclose carbon credits as an offset for its GHG emissions under Disclosure Requirement E1-6 on GHG
emissions;
(f) not disclose carbon credits as a means to reach the GHG emission reduction targets disclosed under Disclosure
Requirement E1-4; and
(g) calculate the amount of carbon credits to be cancelled in the future, as the sum of carbon credits in metric
tonnes of CO2eq over the duration of existing contractual agreements.
AR 64. The information on carbon credits cancelled in the reporting year and planned to be cancelled in the future may be
presented using the following tabular formats.
