ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 39/1642. Water supply, sewerage, waste management and remediation activities
2.1. Phosphorus recovery from waste water
Description of the activity
Construction, upgrade, operation and renewal of facilities for recovery of phosphorus from urban waste water treatment
plants (WWTP) (aqueous phase and sludge) and from materials (i.e. ashes) after thermal oxidation (i.e. incineration) of
sewage sludge.
The economic activity only includes the facilities and processes that make phosphorus recovery possible, not the previous
steps, such as waste water treatment or incineration facilities.
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E37.00, E38.32 and
F42.99 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.
Technical screening criteria
Substantial contribution to the transition to a circular economy
1. For the process integrated at the waste water treatment plant, covering typically phosphorus salts such as struvite–
magnesium ammonium phosphate (NH 4MgPO 4•6H 2O), the phosphorus recovery process recovers at least 15 % of
the incoming phosphorus load. Only the harvested material, such as struvite, is counted for the calculation of this
threshold.
2. For down-stream recovery after sewage sludge thermal oxidation with chemical phosphorus recovery or after sewage
sludge thermal oxidation with thermo chemical phosphorus recovery, the process recovers at least 80 % of the
incoming phosphorus load from the respective input material, such as sewage sludge ash.
3. The phosphorus extracted out of the system is used either as a component material in a fertilising product compliant with Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (
40)or national fertiliser legislation
where it is more stringent, or in another field of application where the recovered phosphorus fulfils specified functions in accordance with the respective regulations.
