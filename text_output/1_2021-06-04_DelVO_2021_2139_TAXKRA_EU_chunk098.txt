Emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the latest relevant
best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including:
(a) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for the
Large Volume Inorganic Chemicals – Solids and Others industry (  130  ); 
(b) the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste
water and waste gas treatment/management systems in the chemical
sector (  131  ). 
No significant cross-media effects occur.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
3.13.  Manufacture of chlorine  
Description of the activity  
Manufacture of chlorine.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code C20.13 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is a transitional activity as referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU)
2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
Electricity consumption for electrolysis and chlorine treatment is equal or lower than 2.45 MWh per tonne of
chlorine.
Average life-cycle GHG emissions of the electricity used for chlorine production is at or lower than 100 g
CO  2 e/kWh. 
Life-cycle GHG emissions are calculated using Recommendation 2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using
ISO 14067:2018 (  132  ) or ISO 14064-1:2018 (  133  ). 
Quantified life-cycle GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A
