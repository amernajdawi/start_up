(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  In case of pumped hydropower storage not connected to a river body, the 
activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.
In case of pumped hydropower storage connected to a river body, the
activity complies with the criteria for DNSH to sustainable use and
protection of water and marine resources specified in Section 4.5 (Elec ­
tricity production from hydropower).  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  A waste management plan is in place and ensures maximal reuse or 
recycling at end of life in accordance with the waste hierarchy,
including through contractual agreements with waste management
partners, reflection in financial projections or official project documen ­
tation.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  N/A  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
4.11.  Storage of thermal energy  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of facilities that store thermal energy and return it at a later time in the form of
thermal energy or other energy vectors.  
Where an economic activity is an integral element of the ‘Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy
technologies’ as referred to in Section 7.6 of this Annex, the technical screening criteria specified in Section 7.6
apply.

Regulation (EU) 2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The activity stores thermal energy, including Underground Thermal Energy Storage (UTES) or Aquifer Thermal
Energy Storage (ATES).  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  For Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage, the activity complies with the criteria 
set out in Appendix B to this Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  A waste management plan is in place and ensures maximal reuse, remanu ­
facturing or recycling at end of life, including through contractual
agreements with waste management partners, reflection in financial
projections or official project documentation.
