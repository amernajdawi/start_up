Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  Where installed, except for installations in residential building units, the 
specified water use for the following water appliances are attested by
product datasheets, a building certification or an existing product label
in the Union, in accordance with the technical specifications laid down
in Appendix E to this Annex:
(a) wash hand basin taps and kitchen taps have a maximum water flow of
6 litres/min;
(b) showers have a maximum water flow of 8 litres/min;
(c) WCs, including suites, bowls and flushing cisterns, have a full flush
volume of a maximum of 6 litres and a maximum average flush
volume of 3,5 litres;
(d) urinals use a maximum of 2 litres/bowl/hour. Flushing urinals have a
maximum full flush volume of 1 litre.
To avoid impact from the construction site, the activity complies with the
criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  At least 70 % (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and 
demolition waste (excluding naturally occurring material referred to in
category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by
Decision 2000/532/EC) generated on the construction site is prepared
for reuse, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling oper ­
ations using waste to substitute other materials, in accordance with the
waste hierarchy and the EU Construction and Demolition Waste
Management Protocol (  287  ). Operators limit waste generation in processes 
related to construction and demolition, in accordance with the EU
Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol and taking
into account best available techniques and using selective demolition to
enable removal and safe handling of hazardous substances and facilitate
reuse and high-quality recycling by selective removal of materials, using
available sorting systems for construction and demolition waste.
Building designs and construction techniques support circularity and in
particular demonstrate, with reference to ISO 20887 (  288  ) or other 
standards for assessing the disassembly or adaptability of buildings, how
they are designed to be more resource efficient, adaptable, flexible and
dismantleable to enable reuse and recycling.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Building components and materials used in the construction comply with 
the criteria set out in Appendix C to this Annex.
