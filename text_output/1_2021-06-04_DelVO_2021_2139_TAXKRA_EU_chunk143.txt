5.11.  Transport of CO  2 
Description of the activity  
Transport of captured CO  2 via all modes.  
Construction and operation of CO  2 pipelines and retrofit of gas networks where the main purpose is the inte ­
gration of captured CO  2 . 
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular F42.21 and
H49.50 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is an enabling activity in accordance with Article 10(1), point (i), of
Regulation (EU) 2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. The CO  2 transported from the installation where it is captured to the injection point does not lead to CO  2 
leakages above 0.5 % of the mass of CO  2 transported. 
2. The CO  2 is delivered to a permanent CO  2 storage site that meets the criteria for underground geological 
storage of CO  2 set out in Section 5.12 of this Annex; or to other transport modalities, which lead to permanent 
CO  2 storage site that meet those criteria. 
3. Appropriate leak detection systems are applied and a monitoring plan is in place, with the report verified
by an independent third party.
4. The activity may include the installation of assets that increase the flexibility and improve the management
of an existing network..  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  N/A  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
5.12.  Underground permanent geological storage of CO  2 
Description of the activity  
Permanent storage of captured CO  2 in appropriate underground geological formations.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code E39.00 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.EN  L 442/100 Official Journal of the European Union 9.12.2021
