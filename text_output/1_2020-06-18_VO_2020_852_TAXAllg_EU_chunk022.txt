(35) Recalling the joint commitment of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to pursuing the
principles enshr ined in the European Pillar of Social Rights in suppor t of sustainable and inclusive growth, and
recognising the relevance of internatio nal minimum human and labour rights and standards, compl iance with
minimum safeg uards should be a condition for economic activities to qualify as environmentally sustainable. For
that reason, economic activities should only qualify as environmentally sustainable where they are carried out in
alignment with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enter prises and UN Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights, including the declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the Internati onal Labour
Org anisation (ILO), the eight fundamental conventions of the ILO and the Internati onal Bill of Human Rights. The
fundamental convention s of the ILO define human and labour rights that under takings should respect. Several of
those international standards are enshr ined the Char ter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular
the prohibition of slavery and forced labour and the principle of non-discr imination. Those minimum safegua rds are
without prejudice to the application of more stringent requirements relat ed to the environment, health, safety and
social sustainability set out in Union law, where applicable. When compl ying with those minimum safeg uards,
under takings should adhere to the principle of ‘do no signif icant harm’ refer red to in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088,
and take into account the regulatory technical standards adopt ed pursuant to that Regulation that further specify
that principle.
(36) In order to ensure consist ency between this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, this Regulation should
amend Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 to mandate the European Super visor y Auth orities established by Regulations
(EU) No 1093/2010 (52), (EU) No  1094/2010 (53) and (EU) No 1095/2010 (54) of the European Parliament and of 
the Council (collectively , the ‘ESAs’) to jointly develop regulatory technical standards to further specify the details of
the content and presentation of the information in relation to the principle of ‘do no significant harm’. Those
regulatory technical standards should be consiste nt with the content, methodologies, and presentation of the
sustainability indicators in relation to adverse impacts as referred to in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. They should
also be consist ent with the principles enshr ined in the European Pillar of Social Rights, the OECD Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including the ILO Declaration
on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the eight fundamental conventions of the ILO and the International
Bill of Human Rights.
(37) Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 should further be amended to mandate the ESAs to develop, through the Joint
Committ ee, draf t regulatory technical standards to supplement the rules on transparency of the promotion of
environmental characteri stics and of environmentally sustainable investments in pre-contractual disclosures and in
periodic repor ts.
(38) Given the specifi c technical details needed to assess the environmental impact of an economic activity and the fast-
changing nature of both science and technology , the criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities
should be adapt ed regularly to reflect such changes. For the criteria to be up to date , based on scientific evidence
and input from exper ts as well as relevant stak eholders, the conditions for ‘substantial contr ibution’ and ‘signifi cant
harm’ should be specified with more granular ity for different economic activities and should be updat ed regularly .
For that purpose, granular and calibrated technical screening criteria for the diffe rent economic activities should be
established by the Commission on the basis of technical input from a multi-stakehold er platf orm on sustainable
finance.
(39) Some economic activities have a negative impact on the envi ronment, and reducing such negative impact can mak e a
substantial contr ibution to one or more environmental objectives. For those economic activities, it is appropr iate to
establish technical screening criteria that require a substantial impro vement in environmental perf ormance
