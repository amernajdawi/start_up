(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  A monitoring and contingency plan is in place in order to minimise 
methane leakage at the facility.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  For anaerobic digestion plants treating over 100 tonnes per day, emissions 
to air and water are within or lower than the emission levels associated
with the best available technique (BAT-AEL) ranges set for anaerobic
treatment of waste in the latest relevant best available techniques (BAT)
conclusions, including the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for
waste treatment (  419  ). No significant cross-media effects occur. 
The produced digestate meets the requirements for fertilising materials set
out in Component Material Categories (CMC) 4 and 5 for digestate or
CMC 3 for compost, as applicable, in Annex II to Regulation (EU)
2019/1009, or national rules on fertilisers or soil improvers for
agricultural use.
The Nitrogen content (with tolerance level ± 25 %) of the digestate used as
fertiliser or soil improver is communicated to the buyer or the entity in
charge of taking off the digestate.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
5.8.  Composting of bio-waste  
Description of the activity  
Construction or operation of dedicated facilities for the treatment of separately collected bio-waste through
composting (aerobic digestion) with the resulting production and utilisation of compost (  420  ). 
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E38.21 and
F42.99 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
