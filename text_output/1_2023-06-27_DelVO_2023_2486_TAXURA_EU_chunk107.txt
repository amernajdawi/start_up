Technical screening criteria
Substantial contribution to the transition to a circular economy
1.The economic activity consists of selling a second-hand product that had been used for its intended purpose by a
customer (physical person or legal person), potentially after its prior cleaning, repair, refurbishment or remanufacturing.
2.The sold product is covered by a sales contract where relevant and in accordance with provisions as regards conformity
of the product, liability of the seller (
174)(including the option of a shorter liability or limitation period for second-hand
products), burden of proof, remedies for lack of conformity, the modalities for the exercise of those remedies, repair or
replacement of the goods, and commercial guarantees.
3.Where the product has been repaired, refurbished or remanufactured before reselling, the activity implements a waste
management plan that ensures that the productâ€™s materials and components that have not been reused in the same
product, are reused elsewhere, or where reuse is not possible (for example due to damage, degradation or hazardous
substances), are recycled, or, only where reuse and recycling are not viable, are disposed of. For remanufacturing, the waste
management plan is accessible to the public.
4.Where the economic activity involves delivery of packaged products to customers (physical person or legal person)
including when the activity is operated as an e-commerce (175), the primary and secondary packaging of the product
complies with one of the following criteria:
(a) the packaging is made of at least 65 % recycled material. Where the packaging is made from paper or cardboard, the
remaining primary raw material are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the Programme for the
Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes (PEFC International), or equivalent recognised schemes. Coatings with
plastics or metals are not used. For plastic packaging only mono-materials without coatings are used, halogen-
containing polymers are not used. A declaration of compliance is provided specifying the material composition of the
packaging and the shares of recycled and primary raw material;
(174)The conformity of the product and the period of liability of the seller are set in accordance with the relevant provisions of Directive
(EU) 2019/771.
