Where the researched, developed or innovated technology, product or other solution is at TRL 8 or higher, life-
cycle GHG emissions are calculated using Recommendation 2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using
ISO 14067:2018 (  316  ) or ISO 14064-1:2018 (  317  ) and are verified by an independent third party.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The researched technology, product or other solution complies with the 
criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  Any potential risks to the good status or the good ecological potential of 
bodies of water, including surface water and groundwater, or to the good
environmental status of marine waters from the researched technology,
product or other solution are evaluated and addressed.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Any potential risks to the circular economy objectives from the researched 
technology, product or other solution are evaluated and addressed, by
considering the types of potential significant harm as set out in
Article 17(1), point. (d), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Any potential risks to generate a significant increase in the emissions of 
pollutants to air, water or land from the researched technology, product or
other solution are evaluated and addressed.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  Any potential risks to the good condition or resilience of ecosystems or to 
the conservation status of habitats and species, including those of Union
interest, from the researched technology, product or other solution are
evaluated and addressed.  
9.2.  Research, development and innovation for direct air capture of CO  2 
Description of the activity  
Research, applied research and experimental development of solutions, processes, technologies, business models
and other products dedicated to the direct air capture of CO  2 in the atmosphere.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular M71.1.2 and
M72.1 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 10(1), point (i), of Regulation
(EU) 2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. The activity researches, develops or provides innovation for technologies, products or other solutions that
are dedicated to the direct air capture of CO  2 in the atmosphere.
