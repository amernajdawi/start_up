land-use change impacts.  For example, companies may 
use the agricultural or forestry statistic for the assumed
location to determine the change in land occupation
for the studied product versus the total land change
in that location. The following example shows the
steps companies can follow to use agricultural data
to determine whether land-use change has occurred.
The same technique may be used for managed wood
products using forestry data.  If the crop or biomass that 
is being studied is shown to occupy less land over the
20-year assessment period, the company can assume that
no land-use change has taken place.  If the amount of 
land occupied by the crop or biomass being studied has
increased, then land-use change impacts are attributable.
In this case the company needs to assume what the
original land category was. This should be based on the
type of land present in the assumed location and when
more than one land type is possible the conservative
choice should be made.  
It is important to note that any assumptions made
about land-use change impacts are only estimations
and subject to much uncertainty. Because these
estimation techniques cannot identify when the land-
use change occurs, companies should always assume
1/20th of the land-use change impact, as shown in
the following examples.  Companies may also choose 
not to make any assumptions about land-use change
and only use the worst case scenario (e.g., all land is
converted from the most carbon rich land category).
Information on the methods used to determine
land-use change impacts should be included in the
inventory report for transparency. Appendix	B.	 Land-Use Change Impacts
