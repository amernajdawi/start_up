ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 261/284ii. “available techniques” means those developed on a scale which allows
implementation in the relevant industrial sector, under economically
and technically viable conditions, taking into consideration the costs
and advantages, whether or not the techniques are used or produced
inside the Member State in question, as long as they are reasonably
accessible to the operator; and
iii. “best” means most effective in achieving a high general level of protection of the environment as a whole.
Biodiversity loss The reduction of any aspect of biological diversity (i.e., diversity at the
genetic, species and ecosystem levels) in a particular area through death
(including extinction), destruction or physicalmanual removal; it can refer to many scales, from global extinctions to population extinctions, resulting
in decreased total diversity at the same scale.
Biodiversity or biological diversity The variability among living organisms from all sources including terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which
they are a part. This includes variation in genetic, phenotypic, phylogenetic, and functional attributes, as well as changes in abundance and distribution
over time and space within and among species, biological communities and
ecosystems .
Biodiversity sensitive area Natura 2000 network of protected areas, UNESCO World Heritage sites and
Key Biodiversity Areas (‘KBAs’), as well as other protected areas, as referred
to in Appendix D of Annex II to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 (
8).
Biosphere integrity or ecological integrity The ability of an ecosystem to support and maintain ecological processes
and a diverse community of organisms.
Blue economy The blue economy encompasses all industries and sectors related to oceans,
seas and coasts, whether they are based in the marine environment (e.g.,
shipping, fisheries, energy generation) or on land (e.g. ports, shipyards,
land-based aquaculture and algae production, coastal tourism).
BREF or EU Best Available Techniques reference documentsA document resulting from the exchange of information organised pursuant to Article 13 of Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of
the Council (
9)on industrial emissions, drawn up for defined activities and
describing, in particular, applied techniques, present emissions and
consumption levels, techniques considered for the determination of best
available techniques as well as BAT conclusions and any emerging
techniques, giving special consideration to the criteria listed in Annex III of Directive 2010/75/EU.
