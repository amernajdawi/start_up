Certified Emission Reductions A unit of emission reduction generated by a CDM project. CERs are tradable commodities that can be
(CERs) used by Annex 1 countries to meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.
Co-generation unit/Combined A facility producing both electricity and steam/heat using the same fuel supply. (Chapter 3)
heat and power (CHP)
Consolidation Combination of GHG emissions data from separate operations that form part of one company or group
of companies. (Chapter 3, 4)
Control The ability of a company to direct the policies of another operation. More specifically, it is defined as
either operational control (the organization or one of its subsidiaries has the full authority to introduceand implement its operating policies at the operation) or financial control (the organization has theability to direct the financial and operating policies of the operation with a view to gaining economicbenefits from its activities).

CO
2equivalent (CO2-e) The universal unit of measurement to indicate the global warming potential (GWP) of each of the six
greenhouse gases, expressed in terms of the GWP of one unit of carbon dioxide. It is used to evaluatereleasing (or avoiding releasing) different greenhouse gases against a common basis.
Cross-sector calculation tool A GHG Protocol calculation tool that addresses GHG sources common to various sectors, e.g.
emissions from stationary or mobile combustion. See also GHG Protocol calculation tools(www.ghgprotocol.org).
Direct GHG emissions Emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the reporting company. (Chapter 4)
Direct monitoring Direct monitoring of exhaust stream contents in the form of continuous emissions monitoring (CEM)
or periodic sampling. (Chapter 6)
Double counting Two or more reporting companies take ownership of the same emissions or reductions. (Chapter 3, 4, 8, 11)
Emissions The release of GHG into the atmosphere.
Emission factor A factor allowing GHG emissions to be estimated from a unit of available activity data (e.g. tonnes of
fuel consumed, tonnes of product produced) and absolute GHG emissions. (Chapter 6)
Emission Reduction Unit (ERU) A unit of emission reduction generated by a Joint Implementation (JI) project. ERUs are tradable
