ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 134/284(b) any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent or mitigate material negative actual or potential
impacts and to protect and restore biodiversity and ecosystems, and to address risks and opportunities; and
(c) the plans and capacity of the undertaking to adapt its strategy and business model in line with:
i. respecting planetary boundaries related to biosphere integrity and land-system change
;
ii. the vision of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and its relevant goals and targets;
iii. relevant aspects of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 (70);
iv. Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Directive 92/43/EEC (EU
Birds and Habitats Directives) (71); and
v. Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (Marine Strategy Framework Directive (
72);
(d) the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks, dependencies and opportunities related to biodiversity and ecosystems, and how the undertaking manages them; and
(e) the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and
opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on biodiversity and ecosystems.
2. This Standard sets out Disclosure Requirements related to the undertaking’s relationship to terrestrial, freshwater and
marine habitats, ecosystems and populations of related fauna and flora species, including diversity within species,
between species and of ecosystems and their interrelation with indigenous peoples and other affected communities.
3. The terms “biodiversity” and “biological diversity” refer to the variability among living organisms from all sources
including, inter alia, terrestrial, freshwater , marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of
which they are part.
Interaction with other ESRS
4. ‘Biodiversity and ecosystems ’ are closely connected to other environmental matters. The main direct drivers of
biodiversity and ecosystems change are climate change, pollution, land-use change, freshwater -use change and sea-
use change, direct exploitation of organisms and invasive alien species. These drivers are covered in this standard,
except for climate change (covered by ESRS E1) and pollution (covered by ESRS E2).
5. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of material impacts and dependencies on biodiversity and ecosystems , the
Disclosure Requirements of other environmental ESRS should be read and interpreted in conjunction with the
specific disclosure requirements of this Standard. The relevant disclosure requirements covered in other
environmental ESRS are:
(a) ESRS E1 Climate change, which addresses in particular GHG emissions and energy resources (energy
consumption);
(b) ESRS E2 Pollution, which addresses pollution to air, water and soil;
(c) ESRS E3 Water and marine resources which addresses in particular water resources (water consumption) and
marine resources;
