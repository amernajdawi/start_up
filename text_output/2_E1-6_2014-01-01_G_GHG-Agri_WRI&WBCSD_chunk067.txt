Chapter 8: Accounting for Carbon Stocks
Agricultural systems contain C in above-g round and below-ground biomass, dead organic
matter (DOM), soil organic matter, and harv ested products (Chapter 4.2). These C stocks
are reversible - any C sequestered in C stocks will eventually be emitted to the atmosphere. Also, changes in C stocks can ta ke decades to reach equilibrium following a
change in farm management or land use. Th ese special features of agriculture have
important implications for whether and how C stocks should be included within GHG
inventories.  

This chapter:
 Describes how changes in C stocks should be reported in terms of CO
2 fluxes.
 Describes the types of CO 2 fluxes that should / s hould not be included in
inventories.
 Describes how the CO 2 fluxes from long-term changes in C stocks can be spread
over multiple reporting periods.

Summary of requirements and main recommendations:
 Companies should report the net CO 2 fluxes (in tonnes CO 2) to/from organic C
stocks in mineral/organic soils and above-ground and below-ground woody
biomass, as well as the CO 2 emissions from DOM and biomass combustion.
 Natural disturbances, Payments for Environmental Services (PESs), and
conservation areas should be accounted fo r equivalently to other agricultural
activities.
 Companies should use peer -reviewed methods for CO 2 flux calculations.
 When relevant, companies should amortize changes in C stocks evenly over time
using a fixed-rate approach.
 Companies should account for historical changes in land use or management
occurring on or afte r the base period.
8.1 Including flux and stock data in inventories  

Companies  should report net CO 2 flux data 
Because of the reversibility of C stocks, cha nges to C stocks can be quantified using data
on:
 Stock size, when measured in units of mass of C (e.g., metric tonnes C/ha) at two
points in time; or
 The net balance of CO 2 emissions and CO 2 removals (‘net fluxes’) to or from a
stock, measured in units of mass of CO 2.
