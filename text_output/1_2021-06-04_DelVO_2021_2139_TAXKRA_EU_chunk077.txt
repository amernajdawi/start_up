1.2. The restoration plan contains careful consideration of local hydrological and pedological conditions,
including the dynamics of soil saturation and the change of aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
1.3. All wetland management relevant DNSH criteria are addressed in the restoration plan.
1.4. The restoration plan provides for monitoring which ensures the correctness of the information contained
in the plan, in particular as regards the data relating to the involved area.
2. Climate benefit analysis  
2.1. The activity complies with the following criteria:
(a) the climate benefit analysis demonstrates that the net balance of GHG emissions and removals generated by
the activity over a period of 30 years after the beginning of the activity is lower than a baseline,
corresponding to the balance of GHG emissions and removals over a period of 30 years starting at the
beginning of the activity, associated to the business-as-usual practices that would have occurred on the
involved area in the absence of the activity;
(b) the projected long-term average net GHG balance of the activity is lower than the long-term average GHG
balance projected for the baseline, referred to in point 2.2, where long term corresponds to 100 years.
2.2. The calculation of climate benefit complies with all of the following criteria:
(a) the analysis is consistent with the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse
Gas Inventories (  71 ). In particular, if the wetland definition used in that analysis differs from the wetland 
definition used in the national GHG inventory, the analysis includes an identification of the different land
categories covered by the involved area. The climate benefit analysis is based on transparent, accurate,
consistent, complete and comparable information, covers all carbon pools impacted by the activity,
including above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, deadwo od, litter and soil, relies on the most conser Â­
vative assumptions for calculations and includes appropriate considerations about the risks of non-
permanence and reversals of carbon sequestration, the risk of saturation and the risk of leakage. For
coastal wetlands, climate benefit analysis considers projections of expected relative sea level rise and the
potential that the wetlands will migrate;
(b) the business-as-usual practices, including harvesting practices, are one of the following:
(i) the management practices as documented before the start of the activity, if any;
(ii) the most recent business-as-usual practices prior to the start of the activity.
(c) the resolution of the analysis is proportionate to the size of the area concerned and values specific to the area
concerned are used;
(d) emissions and removals that occur due to natural disturbances, such as pests and diseases infestations, fires,
wind, storm damages, that impact the area and cause underperformance do not result in non-compliance with
the criteria of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, provided that the climate benefit analysis is consistent with the
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories regarding emissions
and removals due to natural disturbances.
4. Guarantee of permanence  
4.1. In accordance with national law, the wetland status of the area in which the activity takes place is
guaranteed by one of the following measures:
(a) the area is designated to be retained as wetland and may not be converted to other land use;
(b) the area is classified as a protected area;
(c) the area is the subject of any legal or contractual guarantee ensuring that it will remain a wetland.
