ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 160/284(b) identify physical risks including depletion of stock and use of virgin and non-virgin renewable resources, and
of non-renewable resources;
(c) identify opportunities categorised by:
i. resource efficiency: e.g., transition to more efficient services and processes requiring less resources, eco-
design for longevity , repair, reuse, recycle, by- products, take-back systems, decoupling activity from
extraction of materials, intensifying circular material use, creation of a system that allows for demateria ­
lization (e.g., digitisation, improving utilisation rates, weight reduction); practices to ensure products and
materials are collected, sorted, and reused, repaired, refurbished, remanufactured;
ii. markets: e.g., demand for less resource-intense products and services, and new consumption models such
as product-as- a-service, pay-per-use, sharing, leasing;
iii. financing: e.g., access to green funds, bonds or loans;
iv. resilience: e.g., diversification of resources and business activities (e.g., start a new business unit to recycle
new materials), investing in green infrastructures, adopting recycling and circularity mechanisms that
reduce the dependencies
, capability of the undertaking to safeguard future stocks and flows of resources;
and
v. reputation.
AR 6. The undertaking may consider the following methodologies to assess its impacts, risks and opportunities in its
own operations and along its upstream and downstream value chain:
(a) Commission Recommendation 2021/2279 on the use of the Environmental Footprint methods to measure and communicate the life cycle environmental performance of products and organizations (Annex I – Product Environmental Footprint; Annex III – Organisation Environmental Footprint); and
(b) Material Flow Analysis (MFA) from the European Environment Agency.
AR 7. When providing information on the outcome of the materiality assessment, the undertaking shall consider:
(a) a list of business units associated to resource use and circular economy material impacts, risks and
opportunities in the context of the products and services of the undertaking and the waste it generates;
(b) a list and prioritisation of the material resources used by the undertaking;
(c) the material impacts and risks of staying in business as usual;
(d) the material opportunities related to a circular economy;
(e) the material impacts and risks of a transition to a circular economy; and
(f) the stages of the value chain where resource use, risks and negative impacts are concentrated.
Disclosure Requirement E5-1 – Policies related to resource use and circular economy
AR 8. The policies described under this Disclosure Requirement may be integrated in broader environmental or
sustainability policies covering different subtopics.
AR 9. When providing information on its policies, the undertaking shall consider whether and how its policies address:
(a) the waste hierarchy : (a) prevention; (b) preparing for re-use; (c) recycling; (d) other recovery , e.g., energy
recovery; and (e) disposal. In this context, the waste treatment cannot be considered as a recovery;OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
