Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The installation and operation of electric heat pumps complies with both of the following criteria:
(a) refrigerant threshold: Global Warming Potential does not exceed 675;
(b) energy efficiency requirements laid down in the implementing regulations (  188  ) under Directive 2009/125/EC 
are met.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  The activity assesses availability of and, where feasible, uses equipment and 
components of high durability and recyclability and that are easy to
dismantle and refurbish.
A waste management plan is in place and ensures maximal reuse, remanu ­
facturing or recycling at end of life, including through contractual
agreements with waste management partners, reflection in financial
projections or official project documentation.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  For air to air heat pumps with rated capacity of 12 kW or below, indoor 
and outdoor sound power levels are below the threshold set out in
Commission Regulation (EU) No 206/2012 (  189  ). 
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  N/A  
4.17.  Cogeneration of heat/cool and power from solar energy  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of facilities co-generating electricity and heat/cool from solar energy.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular D35.11 and
D35.30 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.
