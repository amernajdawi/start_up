of 4 June 2021  
supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council by
establishing the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an
economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation or climate
change adaptation and for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm
to any of the other environmental objectives  
(Text with EEA relevance)  
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,  
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,  
Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the
establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (  1 ), and in 
particular Articles 10(3) and 11(3) thereof,  
Whereas:  
(1)  Regulation (EU) 2020/852 establishes the general framework for determining whether an economic activity 
qualifies as environmentally sustainable for the purposes of establishing the degree to which an investment is
environmentally sustainable. That Regulation applies to measures adopted by the Union or by Member States that
set out requirements for financial market participants or issuers in respect of financial products or corporate bonds
that are made available as environmentally sustainable, to financial market participants that make available
financial products, and to undertakings that are subject to the obligation to publish a non-financial statement
pursuant to Article 19a of Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (  2 ) or a 
consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Article 29a of that Directive. Economic operators or public
authorities that are not covered by Regulation (EU) 2020/852 may also apply that Regulation on a voluntary basis.  
(2)  Articles 10(3) and 11(3) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 require the Commission to adopt delegated acts establishing 
the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which a specific economic activity qualifies as
contributing substantially to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation, respectively, and to establish,
for each relevant environmental objective laid down in Article 9 of that Regulation, technical screening criteria for
determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to one or more of those environmental
objectives.  
(3)  Pursuant to Article 19(1), point (h), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, the technical screening criteria are to take into 
account the nature and the scale of the economic activity and sector that they refer to, and whether the economic
activity is a transitional economic activity as referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, or an
enabling activity as referred to in Article 16 of that Regulation. For the technical screening criteria to meet the
requirements of Article 19 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 in an effective and balanced way they should be set as a
quantitative threshold or minimum requirement, as a relative improvement, as a set of qualitative performance
requirements, as process or practice-based requirements, or as a precise description of the nature of the economic
activity itself where that activity by its nature can contribute substantially to climate change mitigation.EN  9.12.2021 Official Journal of the European Union L 442/1  
( 1 ) OJ L 198, 22.6.2020, p. 13.  
( 2 ) Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements,
consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19).
