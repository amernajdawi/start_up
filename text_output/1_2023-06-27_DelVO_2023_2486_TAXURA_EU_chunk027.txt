(4) Transition to a circular economyN/A (5) Pollution prevention and controlDischarges to receiving waters meet the requirements laid down in Directive 91/271/EEC or as required by national provisions stating maximum permissible pollutant levels from discharges to receiving waters. Measures have been implemented to avoid and mitigate harmful storm water overflows from the waste water collection system, which may include nature-based solutions, separate storm water collection systems, retention tanks and treatment of the first flush. Sewage sludge is used in accordance with Council Directive 86/278/EEC ( 9)or as required by national law relating to the spreading of sludge on the soil or any other application of sludge on and in the soil. (6) Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosys ­ temsThe activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this Annex. 2.3. Sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) Description of the activity Construction, extension, operation and renewal of urban drainage systems facilities that mitigate pollution and flood hazards due to discharges of urban runoff and improve the urban water quality and quantity, by harnessing natural processes, such as infiltration and retention. The activity includes SUDS promoting infiltration, evaporation and other stormwater treatments (including water butts, site layout and management, pervious pavements, filter drains, swales, filter strips, ponds, wetlands, soakaways, infiltration trenches and basins, green roofs, bioretention areas and stormwater pre-treatment devices, including sand filters or silt removal devices (10)) and other innovative systems. The activity does not include nature-based solutions for flood and drought risk prevention and protection outside the urban environment (see Section 3.1 of this Annex). The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E36.00, E37.00 and F42.9 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006. (9)Council Directive 86/278/EEC of 12 June 1986 on the protection of the environment, and in particular of the soil, when sewage sludge is used in agriculture (OJ L 181, 4.7.1986, p. 6).
