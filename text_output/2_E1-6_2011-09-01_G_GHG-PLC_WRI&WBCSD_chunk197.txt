it is more likely that the use of biomass (and not the planting or
re-growth of biomass) will results in GHG emissions than removals.
Growing biomass to create a GHG credit is not attributable to a
product following this standard methodology. However in some
cases, such as a carbon stock change from till to no-till crop rotation)
or use of degraded lands, a company may see a net positive land-use
change impact (e.g., more removal than emissions).
3 This refers only to biomass burning, liming, and other practices
used to prepare converted land.  Biomass burning and fertilizer 
application due to agricultural and forestry practices are also
included in the inventory as attributable processes, separate from
land-use change impacts.

6 The 2006 IPCC guidelines give values for forest land above and
below a certain density of biomass. If the removal of biomass does
not cause a change in carbon stock value, then land-use change
impacts may be calculated as zero.
7 It is important to note that nearly all fires in tropical forests are man-made.

10  Distribution is used in reference to land-use change impacts to 
refer to the apportionment of impacts over the amortization
period. Allocation is defined in chapter 9 as portioning inputs and
outputs of a common process to its product and co-products.
Both can occur when calculating land-use change impacts.
11 Remote sensing is when current multispectral sensors provide
spectral data for identifying and mapping the crop types allowing
for precise monitoring of land-use changes. Current drawbacks of
this method are the relatively recent systematic data collection
(no regular multispectral coverage for 20 years ago timeframe),
and the costs of images and processing.
