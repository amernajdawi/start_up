( 600  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta n­

diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-eff icient
and systemic interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of
ecosystem services (version of 4.6.2021: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/nature-
based-solutions_en/).
