The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code D35.11 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. Agricultural biomass used in the activity complies with the criteria laid down in Article 29, paragraphs 2
to 5, of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Forest biomass used in the activity complies with the criteria laid down in
Article 29, paragraphs 6 and 7, of that Directive.
2. The greenhouse gas emission savings from the use of biomass are at least 80 % in relation to the GHG
saving methodology and the relative fossil fuel comparator set out in Annex VI to Directive (EU) 2018/2001.
3. Where the installations rely on anaerobic digestion of organic material, the production of the digestate
meets the criteria in Sections 5.6 and criteria 1 and 2 of Section 5.7 of this Annex, as applicable.
4. Points 1 and 2 do not apply to electricity generation installations with a total rated thermal input below
2 MW and using gaseous biomass fuels.
5. For electricity generation installations with a total rated thermal input from 50 to 100 MW, the activity
applies high-efficiency cogeneration technology, or, for electricity-only installations, the activity meets an energy
efficiency level associated with the best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the latest relevant best
available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for large
combustion plants (  172  ). 
6. For electricity generation installations with a total rated thermal input above 100 MW, the activity complies
with one or more of the following criteria:
(a) attains electrical efficiency of at least 36 %;
(b) applies highly efficient CHP (combined heat and power) technology as referred to in Directive 2012/27/EU of
the European Parliament and of the Council (  173  ); 
(c) uses carbon capture and storage technology. Where the CO  2 that would otherwise be emitted from the 
electricity generation process is captured for the purpose of underground storage, the CO  2 is transported and 
stored underground in accordance with the technical screening criteria set out in Sections 5.11 and 5.12,
respectively, of this Annex.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A
