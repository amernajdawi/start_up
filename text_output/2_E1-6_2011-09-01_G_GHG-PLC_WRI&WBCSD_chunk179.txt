Appendix	B.	 Land-Use Change Impacts  
wood is harvested from a forest that is not converted
(forest remaining forest), a carbon stock change can
be calculated based on the change in forest density.
To complete the land-use change impact calculation,
companies need to consider what emissions may have
occurred as a result of the carbon stock or land-use
change unless these are already included in the default
emission factors.  
B.1.3	 Distribution	of	land-use	change	impacts
Once land-use change impacts are deemed attributable
and impacts are identified, a company needs to distribute
those impacts between the studied product and other
co-products that are outputs of the land.  This is because, 
in most cases, land-use change occurs on land that
produces products over many years, and therefore it is
not appropriate to apply all the land-use change impacts
to the first products generated within the area.  Using the 
example from figure B.1 above, a company has calculated
a carbon stock change associated with the product (in this
example, a crop) of 150 tons. The next question is how
to distribute those emissions to the products that are
harvested from that land. Figure B.2 illustrates three ways
land-use change impacts can be distributed over time:  
A) single year, B) 20 year constant, or C) 20 year decline.  
In this standard, land-use change impacts are distributed
using option B: evenly over an amortization period of
either 20 years or the length of one harvest (whichever  
is longer).  This option was chosen as the most consistent 
way to distribute impacts for use in a GHG inventory,
as both option A and option C create an incentive for companies to delay inventory reporting in an effort to
reduce land-use change impacts. It is recognized that
applying any time period to amortize emissions creates
an arbitrary cut off after which companies are free to
grow products on the land without a land-use change
burden. However, identifying no time period would create
additional uncertainties and inconsistent inventories.
There are several ways a company may distribute land-use
change impacts using the amortization period depending
on the harvested product:
1. For an annually harvested crop, a company applies
1/20th of the impacts to the products produced from
each yearly harvest
2. For a semi-annual crop or herbaceous plant, a company
may estimate the production of the land over 20 years
and then apply the impacts to each ton of harvested
biomass
3. For biomass with an extended harvest period (greater
