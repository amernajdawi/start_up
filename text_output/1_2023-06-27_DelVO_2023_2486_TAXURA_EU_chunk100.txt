7.For lifecycle performance management software, at least one of the following capabilities specified in points (a) to (e) is
met in its full scope:
(a) supporting the monitoring and assessment of the circularity performance (157)of a product, equipment or
infrastructure during its lifecycle over time;
(b) comparing circularity performance against original circularity design goals, analysing deviations and their root causes;
(c) supporting the planning and documentation of measures required to prolong the useful life of the product, equipment
or infrastructure, such as maintenance, retrofit, or other services;
(d) supporting the impact assessment of such measures on circularity performance;
(e) providing the user with data required to take decisions on the future use of the product, equipment, or infrastructure, such as retrofit, change of use, decommissioning and recycling.
8.All IT/OT data-driven solutions should meet the following criteria:
(a) techniques are adopted that support the reuse and use of secondary raw materials and reused components, and the solutions are designed for high durability, recyclability, easy disassembly, adaptability and upgradability;
(b) measures are in place to manage and recycle waste at the end-of life, including through decommissioning contractual
agreements with recycling service providers, reflection in financial projections or official project documentation.
These measures ensure that components and materials are segregated and treated to maximise recycling and reuse in
accordance with the waste hierarchy, EU waste regulation principles and applicable regulations, in particular through
the reuse and recycling of batteries and electronics and the critical raw materials therein. These measures also include
the control and management of hazardous materials;
(c) preparation for re-use, recovery or recycling operations, or proper treatment, including the removal of all fluids and a
selective treatment are performed in accordance with Annex VII to Directive 2012/19/EU.
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)
(1) Climate change mitigation N/A
(2) Climate change adaptation The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.
(3)
Sustainable use and protec ­
tion of water and marine
resourcesThe activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.
(157)‘Circularity performance’ is to be assessed on the basis of: (i) product durability, reliability, reusability, upgradability, reparability, ease
of maintenance and refurbishment; (ii) presence of substances that inhibit the circularity of products and materials; (iii) energy use or
energy efficiency of products; (iv) resource use or resource efficiency of products; (v) recycled content in products; (vi) ease of
disassembly, remanufacturing and recycling of products and materials; (vii) life-cycle environmental impact of products, including
their carbon and environmental footprints; (viii) preventing and reducing waste, including packaging waste.OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
