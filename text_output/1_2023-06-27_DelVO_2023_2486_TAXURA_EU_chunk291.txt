ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 106/164(b) relevant contaminants are removed, controlled, contained or diminished using physical, chemical, biological or other
methods to ensure that the landfill and the contaminated area (land, water body or other), taking into account its use
at the time of the damage or approved future use of the area, no longer pose any significant risk of adversely affecting
human health and the environment, as specified in national regulatory standards or, where such standards are not
available, in an internal risk-assessment taking into account the characteristic and the extent of the impacted area
(land, water body or other), the type, properties (persistence, mobility and toxicity) and concentration of the
substances, preparations, organisms or micro-organisms, possible migration pathways and the probability of
dispersion (64).
2.The activity is prepared and conducted in line with best industry practice and includes all of the following elements:
(a) the non-conforming or illegal landfill or dumpsite to be remediated has been closed and is not taking in further waste
other than possibly inert or biostabilised waste to be used as landfill cover material (as far as allowed in the
environmental permit for the remediation project);
(b) preparatory investigations including site-specific surveys and physical, chemical or microbiological data collection are
carried out in line with best industry practice and best available techniques to establish:
(i) the location, characteristics and extent of the landfill and the polluted area;
(ii) the underlying geological and hydrological conditions;
(iii) the likely quantity, composition and sources of the landfilled waste;
(iv) soil and water pollution originating from it as well as the risks to human health and the environment;
(c) the results of such remedial investigations are inputs for a feasibility study that defines the objectives, targets and scope
for the remediation and evaluates alternative remedial options;
(d) the remedial options are analysed in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex II to Directive 2004/35/CE and
in Annexes I and III to Directive 1999/31/EC, or for activities located in third countries in equivalent national law or commonly accepted international standards (
65), and described in a feasibility study produced for the landfill
remediation project that convincingly demonstrates how the selected remedial option is the overall best solution to meet the defined remediation objectives and targets;
