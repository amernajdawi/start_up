(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Measures are in place to manage waste, both in the use phase and in the 
end-of-life of the vessel, in accordance with the waste hierarchy, including
the control and management of hazardous materials on board of ships and
ensuring their safe recycling.
For battery-operated vessels, those measures include reuse and recycling of
batteries and electronics, including critical raw materials therein.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Engines in vessels comply with emission limits set out in Annex II to 
Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 (including vessels meeting those limits
without type-approved solutions such as through after-treatment).  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  N/A  
6.8.  Inland freight water transport  
Description of the activity  
Purchase, financing, leasing, rental and operation of freight vessels on inland waters, involving vessels that are not
suitable for sea transport.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE code H50.4 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Where an economic activity in this category does not fulfil the substantial contribution criterion specified in
point (a) of this Section, the activity is a transitional activity as referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU)
2020/852, provided it complies with the remaining technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. The activity complies with one or both of the following criteria:
(a) the vessels have zero direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emission; 
(b) where technologically and economically not feasible to comply with the criterion in point (a), until
31 December 2025, the vessels have direct (tailpipe) emissions of CO  2 per tonne kilometre (g CO  2 /tkm), 
calculated (or estimated in case of new vessels) using the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (  245  ), 50 % 
lower than the average reference value for emissions of CO  2 defined for heavy duty vehicles (vehicle 
subgroup 5- LH) in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation 2019/1242.
2. Vessels are not dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
_____________
( 245  ) The Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator is defined as the ratio of mass of CO  2 emitted per unit of transport work. It is a 
representative value of the energy efficiency of the ship operation over a consistent period which represents the overall tradi ng
pattern of the vessel. Guidance on how to calculate this indicator is provided in the document MEPC.1/Circ. 684 from IMO.EN  9.12.2021 Official Journal of the European Union L 442/109
