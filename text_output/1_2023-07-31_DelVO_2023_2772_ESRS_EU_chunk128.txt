ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 130/284(c) identify opportunities categorised by:
i. resource efficiency: e.g., transition to more efficient services and processes requiring less water and marine
resources;
ii. markets: e.g., development of less resource-intense products and services, diversification of business activities;
iii. financing: e.g., access to green funds, bonds or loans;
iv. resilience: e.g., diversification of marine or water resources and business activities (e.g., starting a new
business unit on ecosystem restoration), investing in green infrastructures, nature-based solutions,
adopting recycling and circularity mechanisms that reduce the dependencies on water or marine
resources; and
v. reputation: positive stakeholder engagement as a result of a proactive stance on managing nature-related
risks (e.g., leading to preferred partner status).
AR 14. The undertaking may rely on primary, secondary or modelled data collection or other relevant approaches to assess material impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities, including Commission
Recommendation 2021/2279 on the use of the Environmental Footprint methods to measure and communicate the life cycle environmental performance of products and organisations (Annex I – Product Environmental
Footprint; Annex III – Organisation Environmental Footprint).
AR 15. When providing information on the outcome of the materiality assessment, the undertaking shall consider:
(a) a list of geographical areas where water is a material issue for the undertaking’s own operations and its
upstream and downstream value chain;
(b) a list of marine resources-related commodities used by the undertaking which are material to the good
environmental status of marine waters as well as for the protection of marine resources; and
(c) a list of sectors or segments associated with water and marine resources material impacts, risks and
opportunities.
Disclosure Requirement E3-1 – Policies related to water and marine resources
AR 16. The policies described under this Disclosure Requirement may be integrated in broader environmental or
sustainability policies covering different subtopics.
AR 17. When disclosing information under paragraph 9, the undertaking may disclose whether its policies :
(a) prevent further deterioration and protect and enhance the status of water bodies and aquatic ecosystems;
(b) promote sustainable water use based on a long-term protection of available water resources;
(c) aim at enhanced protection and improvement of the aquatic environment;
(d) promote a good environmental status of marine water; and
(e) promote reduction of water withdrawals and water discharges.
AR 18. The undertaking may also disclose information about policies which:
(a) contribute to good ecological and chemical quality of surface water bodies and good chemical quality and
quantity of groundwater bodies, in order to protect human health, water supply, natural ecosystems and
biodiversity, the good environmental status of marine waters and the protection of the resource base upon
which marine related activities depend;
(b) minimise material impacts and risks and implement mitigation measures that aim to maintain the value and
functionality of priority services and to increase resource efficiency on own operations; and
(c) avoid impacts on affected communities.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
