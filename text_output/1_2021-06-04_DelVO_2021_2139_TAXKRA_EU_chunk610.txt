(5) Pollution prevention and control  Emissions are within or lower than the emissions levels associated with the 
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the latest relevant
best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including the best available
techniques (BAT) conclusions for large combustion plants (  269  ). No 
significant cross-media effects occur.
For combustion plants with thermal input greater than 1 MW but below
the thresholds for the BAT conclusions for large combustion plants to
apply, emissions are below the emission limit values set out in Annex II,
part 2, to Directive (EU) 2015/2193.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
4.8.  Electricity generation from bioenergy  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of electricity generation installations that produce electricity exclusively from biomass,
biogas or bioliquids, excluding electricity generation from blending of renewable fuels with biogas or bioliquids (see
Section 4.7 of this Annex).  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code D35.11 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.
The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan,
such that:
(a) for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using
climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale;
(b) for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state-of-the-art
