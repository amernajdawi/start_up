Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The activity complies with one of the following criteria:
(a) the trains and passenger coaches have zero direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emissions; 
(b) the trains and passenger coaches have zero direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emission when operated on a track with 
necessary infrastructure, and use a conventional engine where such infrastructure is not available (bimode).  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.
