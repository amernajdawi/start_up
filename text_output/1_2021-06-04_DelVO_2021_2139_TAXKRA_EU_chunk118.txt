(5) Pollution prevention and control  Overground high voltage lines: 
(a) for construction site activities, activities follow the principles of the IFC
General Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines (  181  ). 
(b) activities respect applicable norms and regulations to limit impact of
electromagnetic radiation on human health, including for activities
carried out in the Union, the Council recommendation on the limi ­
tation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0 Hz
to 300 GHz) (  182  ) and for activities carried out in third countries, the 
1998 Guidelines of International Commission on Non-Ionizing
Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) (  183  ). 
Activities do not use PCBs polyclorinated biphenyls.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex (  184  ). 
4.10.  Storage of electricity  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of facilities that store electricity and return it at a later time in the form of electricity.
The activity includes pumped hydropower storage.  
Where an economic activity is an integral element of the ‘Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy
technologies’ as referred to in Section 7.6 of this Annex, the technical screening criteria specified in Section 7.6
apply.  
The economic activities in this category have no dedicated NACE code as referred to in the statistical classification
of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is an enabling activity in accordance with Article 10(1), point (i), of
Regulation (EU) 2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The activity is the construction and operation of electricity storage including pumped hydropower storage.
Where the activity includes chemical energy storage, the medium of storage (such as hydrogen or ammonia)
complies with the criteria for manufacturing of the corresponding product specified in Sections 3.7 to 3.17 of
this Annex. In case of using hydrogen as electricity storage, where hydrogen meets the technical screening criteria
specified in Section 3.10 of this Annex, re-electrification of hydrogen is also considered part of the activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.
