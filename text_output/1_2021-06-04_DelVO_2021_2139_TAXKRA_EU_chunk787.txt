Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  For vehicles of categories M1 and N1, specific emissions of CO  2 defined in 
Article 3(1), point (h), of Regulation (EU) 2019/631 are not higher than
the fleet-wide CO  2 emissions targets (  477  ). 
The fleet-wide CO  2 emissions target values to be considered are: 
(a) until 31 December 2024:
(i) for NEDC values, the target values as specified in Article 1,
paragraphs 2-3 of Regulation (EU) 2019/631: 95 g CO  2 /km for 
vehicles of category M1 and 147 g CO  2 /km for vehicles of 
category N1;
(ii) for WLTP values, the EU fleet-wide target 2021, as specified in
Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2019/631, in Part A, point 6.0 for
vehicles of category M1 and in Part B, point 6.0 for vehicles of
category N1. Until the respective EU fleet-wide target 2021 is
published, those vehicles of category M1 and N1 whose CO  2 
emissions are only expressed according to WLTP test procedure
will be applied a conversion factor of 1.21 and 1.24 respectively in
order to account for the transition from NEDC to WLTP, resulting
in the corresponding WLTP values of 115 g CO  2 /km for vehicles 
of category M1 and 182 g CO  2 /km for vehicles of category N1; 
(b) from 1 January 2025, the target values as specified in Article 1,
paragraph 4 of Regulation (EU) 2019/631.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  N/A  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Vehicles of categories M1 and N1 are both of the following: 
(a) reusable or recyclable to a minimum of 85 % by weight;
(b) reusable or recoverable to a minimum of 95 % by weight (  478  ). 
Measures are in place to manage waste both in the use phase (main ­
tenance) and the end-of-life of the fleet, including through reuse and
recycling of batteries and electronics (in particular critical raw materials
therein), in accordance with the waste hierarchy.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Vehicles comply with requirements of the most recent applicable stage of 
the Euro 6 light-duty emission type-approval (  479  ) set out in in accordance 
with Regulation (EC) No. 715/2007.
Vehicles comply with the emission thresholds for clean light-duty vehicles
