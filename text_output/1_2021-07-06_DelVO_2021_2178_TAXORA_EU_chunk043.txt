ANNEX IX
KPIs OF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE UNDERTAKINGS
1.KPI related to investments
The KPI related to investments by insurance or reinsurance undertakings shall present the weighted average of those
investments that are directed at funding, or are associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities. The KPI shall be
shown both in percentage terms relative to ‘total investments’ and in absolute monetary units.
Investments shall mean all direct and indirect investments, including investments in collective investment undertakings and
participations, loans and mortgages, property, plant and equipment, as well as, where relevant, intangibles.
In additional disclosures, insurance or reinsurance undertakings shall distinguish the proportion of the investments held in
respect of life insurance contracts where the investment risk is borne by the policy holders and the proportion of remaining
investments. The coverage of the ratio with reference of the balance sheet total shall be disclosed with the exclusion of
exposures referred to in Article 7(1) of this Regulation.
The disclosures shall be broken down by environmental objective in percentage terms and monetary units, where available.
The weighted average of the value of the investments shall be based on the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned economic
activities of investee companies measured by the following:
(a) for investees that are non-financial undertakings, turnover and CapEx KPIs as resulting from the calculation of the KPIs
of the investee in accordance with Annexes I and II;
(b) for investees that are asset managers, turnover-based and CapEx based KPIs as resulting from the calculation of the KPIs
of the investee in accordance with Annexes III and IV;
(c) for investees that are credit institutions, the turnover-based and CapEx based green asset ratio as resulting from the calculation of the green asset ratio of the investee in accordance with Annexes V and VI;
(d) for investees that are investments firms, investments and revenues, as resulting from the calculation of the turnover-
based and CapEx based KPIs of the investee in accordance with Annexes VII and VIII in accordance with the
proportion of services and activities of dealing on own account and not dealing with own account in the income of
the investment firm;
(e) for investees that are insurance or reinsurance undertakings, investments, gross premiums written or, as applicable, total
insurance revenue, as resulting from the calculation either of the turnover-based and CapEx based investments KPI (i.e.
the proportion of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking’s investments other than investments held in respect of life
insurance contracts where the investment risk is borne by the policy holders, that are directed at funding, or are
associated with, Taxonomy-aligned economic activities) combined, where applicable, with the underwriting KPI of the
non-life investee insurance and reinsurance undertakings in accordance with Annexes XI and X.
By way of derogation from the first and fourth paragraph of this point 1, debt securities with the purpose of financing
specific identified activities or projects or environmentally sustainable bonds issued by an investee undertaking shall be
included in the numerator up to the value of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities that the proceeds of those bonds and
debt securities finance, on the basis of information provided by the investee undertaking.
2.KPI related to underwriting activities
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings other than life insurance undertakings shall calculate the KPI related to
underwriting activities and present the ‘gross premiums written’ non-life insurance revenue or, as applicable, reinsurance
revenue corresponding to Taxonomy-aligned insurance or reinsurance activities in accordance with points 10.1. and 10.2.
of Annex II to Climate Delegated Act. The KPI shall be depicted in percentage terms relative to, as applicable, one of the following:
