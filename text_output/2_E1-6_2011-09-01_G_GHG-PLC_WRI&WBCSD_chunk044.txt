guidance8.3.7 Assessing data quality
During data collection, there may be cases where several
data types (direct emissions data, activity data, emission
factors) and data classifications (primary and secondary)
are available for the same process. Figure 8.1 illustrates
this with an example of 4 different options for collecting
the GHG data for process A: direct emissions data (option
1); primary process activity data (option 2A); secondary
process activity data (option 2B); and financial activity
data (option 3). Companies may also have several choices
for emission factors.  Assessing data quality during data 
collection helps companies determine which data most
closely represents the actual emissions released by the
process during the studied product’s life cycle.
Data quality should not be based on intuition or
assumption (e.g., primary data is always better than
secondary). Companies are required to assess data
quality using data quality indicators. Data quality
indicators can be used to qualitatively or quantitatively
address how well the data characterizes the specific

quality can indicate how representative the data are (in
time, technology, and geography) and the quality of the
data measurement (completeness of data collection and
the reliability of the data).
Assessing data quality is valuable for a number of  
reasons, including:
1.     Improving the inventory’s data quality. The results 
of a data quality assessment can identify which data
sources are of low quality, allowing companies to
improve the overall inventory quality by collecting
different data of higher quality
2.     Assisting the assurance process. An assurer may 
request information on the quality of the data used in
the product inventory
3.     Demonstrating to stakeholders the quality of the data 
used in the product inventory
