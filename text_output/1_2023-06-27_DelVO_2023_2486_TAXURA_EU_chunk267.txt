ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 98/164(2) Climate change adaptationThe activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.
(3) Sustainable use and protec Â­
tion of water and marine
resources1. Waste water treatment
The performance of waste water treatment processes conducted by or on behalf of the
manufacturing plant does not lead to any deterioration of water bodies and marine
resources.
When activities fall within their scope, they meet the requirements of Directives
91/271/EEC, 2008/105/EC, 2006/118/EC, 2010/75/EU, 2000/60/EC,
(EU) 2020/2184, 76/160/EEC, 2008/56/EC and 2011/92/EU.
The activity implements best practices specified in the Joint Research Centre Best
Environmental Management Practice for the Public Administration Sector (37).
Where waste water treatment is conducted by an urban waste water treatment plant on behalf of the manufacturing plant, it is ensured that:
(a) the load of pollutants released by the manufacturing plant has no negative effect in
the treatment process of the urban waste water treatment plant;
(b) the load and characteristics of pollutants do not pose any risk or harm to the health
of the staff working in waste water treatment plants;
(c) the urban waste water treatment plant is designed and equipped appropriately to
abate the released polluting substances;
(d) the overall load of the concerned pollutants discharged to the water body is not increased compared to the situation where the emissions from the installation
concerned remained compliant with emission limit values set for direct releases;
(e) the usability of the sewage sludge for nutrient (re)cycling is not affected.
For installations where additional pollutant limits or stricter conditions have been
included in their environmental permit compared to the requirements of the legislation
mentioned above, these stricter conditions apply.
2. Soil and groundwater protection
Appropriate measures are in place to prevent emissions to soil and regular surveillance is
conducted to avoid leaks, spills, incidents or accidents occurring during the use of
equipment and during storage.
3. Water consumption
Operators assess the water footprint of the chemical production processes in line with
ISO 14046:2014 (
38)and ensure that they do not contribute to water scarcity. Based on
this assessment, operators provide a declaration that they do not contribute to water
scarcity which is verified by an independent third party.
