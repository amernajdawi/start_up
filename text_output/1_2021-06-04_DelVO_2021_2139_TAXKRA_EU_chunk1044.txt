for substantial contribution to climate change adaptation to increase their climate-resilience, while respecting the
relevant criteria for doing no significant harm to other environmental objectives.
2. Where the researched, developed or innovated technology, product or other solution already enables an
activity or several activities addressed in this Annex to meet their technical screening criteria for substantial
contribution, the research, development and innovation activity focuses on the delivery of technologies,
