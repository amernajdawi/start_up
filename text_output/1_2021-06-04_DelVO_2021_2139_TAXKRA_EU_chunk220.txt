4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other
people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  40 ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  41 ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.
5. In order for an activity to be considered as an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1), point (b), of
Regulation (EU) 2020/852, the economic operator demonstrates, through an assessment of current and future
climate risks, including uncertainty and based on robust data, that the activity provides a technology, product,
service, information, or practice, or promotes their uses with one of the following primary objectives:
(a) increasing the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of
assets and of other economic activities;
(b) contributing to adaptation efforts of other people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other
economic activities.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  1.  Forest management plan or equivalent instrument  
1.1. The activity takes place on area that is subject to a forest
management plan or an equivalent instrument, as set out in national
law or, where national law does not define a forest management plan,
as referred to in the FAO definition of ‘forest area with long-term forest
management plan’ (  42 ). 
The forest management plan or equivalent instrument covers a period of
10 years or more and is continuously updated.
1.2. Information is provided on the following points that are not
already documented in the forest management plan or equivalent system:
(a) management goals, including major constraints (  43 ); 
(b) general strategies and activities planned to reach the management
goals, including expected operations over the whole forest cycle;

( 40 ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta neously
provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse,
nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient an d
systemic interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosyste m
services (version of 4.6.2021: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/nature-based-solutio ns_
en/).
