Accounting for renewable energy projects
The impact of many of these projects on a company’s inventory will depend on whether
any of the energy that is generated is cons umed on-site by the company or sent to the
grid. If the energy is consumed on-site, the project may reduce the amount of electricity
or fuel consumed, resulting in  a reduction in scope 1 or sc ope 2 emissions that will be 
evident when comparing inventories over time . On the other hand, if the energy is sent
off-site, it shall not be used to lower scope 1 or scope 2 em issions. This is necessary to
prevent double counting of the emissions be nefits of that energy. This requirement
extends to the calculation of performance metrics, which should not include the
emissions benefits of sold energy. The GHG Protocol Guidelines for Grid-Connected
Electricity Projects  – a supplement to the Project Pr otocol (Chapter 1.2) - provide 
guidance on quantifying the emission s reductions from sold energy.
