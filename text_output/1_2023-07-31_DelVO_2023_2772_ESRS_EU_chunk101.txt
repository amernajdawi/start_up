ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 103/284Connectivity of GHG intensity based on revenue with financial reporting information
AR 55. The reconciliation of the net revenue used to calculate GHG intensity to the relevant line item or notes in the
financial statements (as required by paragraph 55) may be done by either:
(a) a cross-reference to the related line item or disclosure in the financial statements; or
(b) if the net revenue cannot be directly cross-referenced to a line item or disclosure in the financial statements, by a quantitative reconciliation using the below tabular format.
Net revenue used to calculate GHG intensity

Total net revenue (in financial statements)
Disclosure Requirement E1-7 – GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits
GHG removals and storage in own operations and the upstream and downstream value chain
AR 56. In addition to their GHG emission inventories, undertakings shall provide transparency on how and to what extent
they either enhance natural sinks or apply technical solutions to remove GHGs from the atmosphere in their own
operations and upstream and downstream value chain. While there are no generally accepted concepts and methodologies for accounting for GHG removals, this Standard aims to increase transparency on the
undertaking’s efforts to remove GHGs from the atmosphere (paragraphs 56 (a) and 58). The GHG removals
outside the value chain that the undertaking supports through the purchase of carbon credits are to be disclosed
separately as required by paragraphs 56 (b) and 59.
AR 57. When disclosing the information on GHG removals and storage from the undertaking’s own operations and its
upstream and donwstream value chain required under paragraphs 56 (a) and 58, for each removal and storage
activity, the undertaking shall describe:
(a) the GHGs concerned;
(b) whether removal and storage are biogenic or from land-use change (e.g., afforestation, reforestation, forest
restoration, urban tree planting, agroforestry, building soil carbon, etc.), technological (e.g., direct air capture),
or hybrid (e.g., bioenergy with CO2 capture and storage), and technological details about the removal, the type of storage and, if applicable, the transport of removed GHGs;
(c) if applicable, a brief explanation of whether the activity qualifies as a nature-based solution; and
(d) how the risk of non-permanence is managed, including determining and monitoring leakage and reversal
events, as appropriate.
Calculation guidance
AR 58. When preparing the information on GHG removals and storage from the undertaking’s own operations and its
upstream and donwstream value chain required under paragraphs 56 (a) and 58, the undertaking shall:
(a) consider, as far as applicable, the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard (version 2004), Product Standard (version
2011), Agriculture Guidance (version 2014), Land use, land-use change, and forestry Guidance for GHG
project accounting (version 2006);OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
