compiling an inventory and the GHG accounting and reporting principles. In evaluating
individual tools, companies should cons ider a range of questions, including:
 Is the tool comprehensive in terms of its  coverage of different emission sources, 
GHGs and management activities, particularly  those that are practiced or planned on 
the farm? And does it integrate the effects of multiple management activities across
the farm?
 What input data are required and will farm managers be able to provide these data?
 How much labor and technical exper tise is required to use the tool?
 Is the tool transparent ab out its methodology, including limitations and assumptions?
 Is the tool geographically repr esentative? Is it tailored to the region/area of interest?
 Is the tool accurate enough to help meet  the business objectives  for compiling an 
inventory?
 Is the tool up-to-date (e.g., are emi ssions factors updated on an annual basis)?
 Does the tool provide estimates of uncertainty?
 Does the tool have verifications functions (e.g., are ranges enforced for the values of
activity data)?
 Can the tool quantify environmental imp acts other than GHG fluxes (e.g., nitrate or
phosphorus pollution)?  
 Can the tool quantify GHG performance metrics?
 Is the tool otherwise consistent  with the GHG accounting principles? 

Figure 7-2 outlines a decision tree for choos ing a tool based on core questions.

7.4 Uncertainty in activity and GHG flux data

The GHG fluxes to/from agricultu ral sources – and especially  non-mechanical sources - 
are inevitably estimated with some degr ee of uncertainty. Id entifying sources of
uncertainty can help companies understand th e steps required to improve the inventory
quality and the level of confidence users s hould have in both the inventory results and
any estimates of emissions reductions from changes in farming practices.

Two types of uncertainty affect GHG flux estimations  
1.Model uncertainty. This refers to intrinsic limitations in the ability of the calculation
approach to reflect real worl d conditions. Such uncertainty is  particularly important for 
non-mechanical sources whose GHG fluxe s are often determined by complex
interactions between biol ogical processes (e.g., nitrif ication and decomposition),
environmental factors (e.g., temperature, ra infall, soil pH), and management practices.
Failure to reflect these interactions accurate ly in the calculation approach can lead to
significant divergence between actual and calculated values. For some sources it may not be possible to improve accu racy until science has refined the calculation approach
(i.e. until the model uncertainty has been  reduced to an acceptable level).
