(b) an independent third-party certifier, at the request of national
authorities or the operator of the activity.
In order to reduce costs, audits may be performed together with any forest
certification, climate certification or other audit.
The independent third-party certifier may not have any conflict of interest
with the owner or the funder, and may not be involved in the devel ­
opment or operation of the activity.
3. Group assessment  
The compliance with the DNSH criteria may be checked:
(a) at the level of the forest sourcing area (  13 ) level as defined by Directive 
(EU) 2018/2001;
(b) at the level of a group of forest holdings sufficiently homogeneous to
evaluate the risk of the sustainability of the forest activity, provided
that all those holdings have a durable relationship between them and
participate in the activity and the group of those holdings remains the
same for all subsequent audits.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.
Detailed information referred to in point 1.2. (i) includes provisions to
comply with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The use of pesticides is reduced and alternative approaches or techniques, 
which may include non-chemical alternatives to pesticides, are favoured, in
accordance with Directive 2009/128/EC, with exception of occasions
where the use of pesticides is needed to control outbreaks of pests and
of diseases.
The activity minimises the use of fertilisers and does not use manure. The
activity complies with Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 or national rules on
fertilisers or soil improvers for agricultural use
Well documented and verifiable measures are taken to avoid the use of
active ingredients that are listed in Annex I, part A, of Regulation (EU)
2019/1021 (  14 ), the Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed consent 
procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international
trade, the Minamata Convention on Mercury, the Montreal Protocol on
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, and of active ingredients that are
listed as classification Ia (‘extremely hazardous’) or Ib (‘highly hazardous’)
in the WHO Recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard (  15 ). The 
activity complies with the relevant national law on active ingredients.
Pollution of water and soil is prevented and cleaning up measures are
undertaken when pollution occurs.

independent information is available and where conditions are sufficiently homogeneous to evaluate the risk of the sustainabili ty
and legality characteristics of the forest biomass.
