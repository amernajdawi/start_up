[106]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard
guidanceaudience may be interested in what they can do, as a
user or consumer of the product, to reduce their impact
on the inventory. Therefore, a company should inform
its stakeholders of the steps it plans to implement as
well as measures its customers or users can implement,
in order to reduce emissions based on the inventory
results. If this is a subsequent report, a company should
also provide an overview of any reductions achieved.
This should be brief and highlight key initiatives or
results. Examples include:
•A plan to focus reductions around a few key emission
sources;
•Information on how users/consumers can reduce key
emission sources ( e.g., reuse, following manufacturer
use instructions, purchasing green power, etc.); and/or • A summary of reductions or increases based on a
previous inventory, highlighting the most effective
initiatives or the reasons why emissions have increased.
Increases in emissions over the reduction-reporting period
should be reported with a clear indication that the figure
represents an increase rather than a reduction. A minus
sign should not be used as this may confuse the audience.
A key step in completing the report is to review the
purposes and context of the study and summarize the
overall conclusions that can be drawn from the inventory.
This step involves evaluating key accounting choices
exercised in developing the inventory and providing a
perspective on the significance and limitations in the
product life cycle study. Companies should also clarify
the purposes that the study sought to fulfill and the
decisions that were outside its purview.
