he Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative is a multi-stakeholder partnership of businesses, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), governments, and othersconvened by the World Resources Institute (WRI), a U.S.-based environmental NGO, and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), aGeneva-based coalition of 170 international companies. Launched in 1998, theInitiative’s mission is to develop internationally accepted greenhouse gas (GHG)accounting and reporting standards for business and to promote their broad adoption. The GHG Protocol Initiative comprises two separate but linked standards: •GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (this document, which provides a step-by-step guide for companies to use in quantifying and reporting theirGHG emissions) •GHG Protocol Project Quantification Standard (forthcoming; a guide for quantifying reductions from GHG mitigation projects) 2TIntroduction

The first edition of the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol Corporate Standard), published in September 2001, enjoyed broad adoption and acceptance around theglobe by businesses, NGOs, and governments. Many industry, NGO,and government GHG programs 1used the standard as a basis for their accounting and reporting systems. Industry groups, such as the International Aluminum Institute, the International Councilof Forest and Paper Associations, and the WBCSD CementSustainability Initiative, partnered with the GHG Protocol Initiativeto develop complementary industry-specific calculation tools.Widespread adoption of the standard can be attributed to the inclu- sion of many stakeholders in its development and to the fact that it is robust, practical, and builds on the experience and expertise ofnumerous experts and practitioners. This revised edition of the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard is the culmination of a two-year multi-stakeholder dialogue, designed to build on experience gained from using the first edition. It includesadditional guidance, case studies, appendices, and a new chapteron setting a GHG target. For the most part, however, the first editionof the Corporate Standard has stood the test of time, and thechanges in this revised edition will not affect the results of mostGHG inventories. This GHG Protocol Corporate Standard provides standards and guidance for companies and other types of organizations 2 preparing a GHG emissions inventory. It covers the accounting and reporting of the six greenhouse gases covered by the KyotoProtocol — carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). The standard and guidance were designed with the following objectives in mind: •To help companies prepare a GHG inventory that represents a true and fair account of their emissions, through the use ofstandardized approaches and principles •To simplify and reduce the costs of compiling a GHG inventory •To provide business with information that can be used to build an effective strategy to manage and reduce GHG emissions •To provide information that facilitates participation in voluntary and mandatory GHG programs •To increase consistency and transparency in GHG accounting and reporting among various companies and GHG programs. Both business and other stakeholders benefit from converging on a common standard. For business, it reduces costs if their GHGinventory is capable of meeting different internal and externalinformation requirements. For others, it improves the consistency,transparency, and understandability of reported information,making it easier to track and compare progress over time.The business value of a GHG inventory Global warming and climate change have come to the fore as akey sustainable development issue. Many governments are takingsteps to reduce GHG emissions through national policies thatinclude the introduction of emissions trading programs, voluntaryprograms, carbon or energy taxes, and regulations and standardson energy efficiency and emissions. As a result, companies mustbe able to understand and manage their GHG risks if they are toensure long-term success in a competitive business environment,and to be prepared for future national or regional climate policies. A well-designed and maintained corporate GHG inventory can serve several business goals, including: •Managing GHG risks and identifying reduction opportunities •Public reporting and participation in voluntary GHG programs •Participating in mandatory reporting programs •Participating in GHG markets •Recognition for early voluntary action. Who should use this standard? This standard is written primarily from the perspective of a busi- ness developing a GHG inventory. However, it applies equally toother types of organizations with operations that give rise to GHGemissions, e.g., NGOs, government agencies, and universities. 3 It should not be used to quantify the reductions associated withGHG mitigation projects for use as offsets or credits—the forthcoming GHG Protocol Project Quantification Standard will provide standards and guidance for this purpose. Policy makers and architects of GHG programs can also use rele- vant parts of this standard as a basis for their own accountingand reporting requirements.INTRODUCTION 3

Relationship to other GHG programs It is important to distinguish between the GHG Protocol Initiative and other GHG programs. The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard focuses only on the accounting and reporting of emissions. It doesnot require emissions information to be reported to WRI or WBCSD.In addition, while this standard is designed to develop a verifiableinventory, it does not provide a standard for how the verificationprocess should be conducted. TheGHG Protocol Corporate Standard has been designed to be program or policy neutral. However, many existing GHG programsuse it for their own accounting and reporting requirements and itis compatible with most of them, including: •Voluntary GHG reduction programs, e.g., the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Climate Savers, the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) Climate Leaders, the Climate Neutral Network,and the Business Leaders Initiative on Climate Change (BLICC) •GHG registries, e.g., California Climate Action Registry (CCAR), World Economic Forum Global GHG Registry •National and regional industry initiatives, e.g., New Zealand Business Council for Sustainable Development, Taiwan Business Council for Sustainable Development, Association des entreprises pour la réduction des gaz à effet de serre (AERES) •GHG trading programs, 4e.g., UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS), Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), and the European UnionGreenhouse Gas Emissions Allowance Trading Scheme (EU ETS) •Sector-specific protocols developed by a number of industry asso- ciations, e.g., Inter national Aluminum Institute, International Council of For est and Paper Associations, International Iron and Steel Institute, the WBCSD Cement Sustainability Initiative, andthe International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA). Since GHG programs often have specific accounting and reporting requirements, companies should always check with any relevantprograms for any additional requirements before developing their inventory. GHG calculation tools To complement the standard and guidance provided here, a number of cross-sector and sector-specific calculation tools are available on the GHG Protocol Initiative website (www.ghgprotocol.org), including a guide for small office-basedorganizations (see chapter 6 for full list). These tools provide step-by-step guidance and electronic worksheets to help userscalculate GHG emissions from specific sources or industries. Thetools are consistent with those proposed by the IntergovernmentalPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) for compilation of emissions at the national level (IPCC, 1996). They have been refined to be user-friendly for non-technical company staff and to increase theaccuracy of emissions data at a company level. Thanks to helpfrom many companies, organizations, and individual expertsthrough an intensive review of the tools, they are believed torepresent current “best practice.” Reporting in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard The GHG Protocol Initiative encourages the use of the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard by all companies regardless of their experience in preparing a GHG inventory. The term “shall” is used in the chapters containing standards to clarify what is required to prepareand report a GHG inventory in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. This is intended to improve the consistency with which the standard is applied and the resulting informationthat is publicly reported, without departing from the initial intent ofthe first edition. It also has the advantage of providing a verifiablestandard for companies interested in taking this additional step. Overview of main changes to the first edition This revised edition contains additional guidance, case studies,and annexes. A new guidance chapter on setting GHG targetshas been added in response to many requests from companiesthat, having developed an inventory, wanted to take the next step of setting a target. Appendices have been added onaccounting for indirect emissions from electricity and onaccounting for sequestered atmospheric carbon. Introduction INTRODUCTION 4

Changes to specific chapters include: •CHAPTER 1: Minor rewording of principles. •CHAPTER 2: Goal-related information on operational bound- aries has been updated and consolidated. •CHAPTER 3: Although still encouraged to account for emissions using both the equity and controlapproaches, companies may now report usingone approach. This change reflects the factthat not all companies need both types of infor-mation to achieve their business goals. Newguidance has been provided on establishingcontrol. The minimum equity threshold forreporting purposes has been removed to enableemissions to be reported when significant. • CHAPTER 4: The definition of scope 2 has been revised to exclude emissions from electricity purchasedfor resale—these are now included in scope 3.This prevents two or more companies fromdouble counting the same emissions in thesame scope. New guidance has been added onaccounting for GHG emissions associated withelectricity transmission and distribution losses.Additional guidance provided on Scope 3 categories and leasing. • CHAPTER 5: The recommendation of pro-rata adjustments was deleted to avoid the need for two adjust-ments. More guidance has been added onadjusting base year emissions for changes incalculation methodologies. • CHAPTER 6: The guidance on choosing emission factors has been improved. •CHAPTER 7: The guidance on establishing an inventory quality management system and on the applica-tions and limitations of uncertainty assessmenthas been expanded. • CHAPTER 8: Guidance has been added on accounting for and reporting project reductions and offsets inorder to clarify the relationship between theGHG Protocol Corporate andProject Standards . • CHAPTER 9: The required and optional reporting categories have been clarified. •CHAPTER 10: Guidance on the concepts of materiality and material discrepancy has been expanded. •CHAPTER 11: New chapter added on steps in setting a target and tracking and reporting progress.Frequently asked questions… Below is a list of frequently asked questions, with directions to therelevant chapters. •What should I consider when setting out to account for and report emissions?

GHG accounting and reporting shall be based on the following principles: RELEVANCE Ensure the GHG inventory appropriately reflects the GHG emissions of the company and serves the decision-making needs of users – both internal and external to the company. COMPLETENESS Account for and report on all GHG emission sources and activities within the chosen inventory boundary. Disclose and justify any specific exclusions. CONSISTENCY Use consistent methodologies to allow for meaningful comparisons of emissions over time.Transparently document any changes to the data, inventory boundary, methods, or any otherrelevant factors in the time series. TRANSPARENCY Address all relevant issues in a factual and coherent manner, based on a clear audit trail.Disclose any relevant assumptions and make appropriate references to the accounting andcalculation methodologies and data sources used. ACCURACY Ensure that the quantification of GHG emissions is systematically neither over nor underactual emissions, as far as can be judged, and that uncertainties are reduced as far as practicable. Achieve sufficient accuracy to enable users to make decisions with reasonableassurance as to the integrity of the reported information.CHAPTER 1: GHG Accounting and Reporting Principles 7STANDARDGHG accounting and reporting practices are evolving and are new to manybusinesses; however, the principles listed below are derived in part fromgenerally accepted financial accounting and reporting principles. They alsoreflect the outcome of a collaborative process involving stakeholders from a wide range of technical, environmental, and accounting disciplines.

GUIDANCE CHAPTER 1 8GHG Accounting and Reporting Principles hese principles are intended to underpin all aspects of GHG accounting and reporting. Their applicationwill ensure that the GHG inventory constitutes a true and fair representation of the company’s GHG emissions.Their primary function is to guide the implementation ofthe GHG Protocol Corporate Standard , particularly when the application of the standards to specific issues or situa-tions is ambiguous. Relevance For an organization’s GHG report to be relevant meansthat it contains the information that users—bothinternal and external to the company—need for theirdecision making. An important aspect of relevance is theselection of an appropriate inventory boundary that reflects the substance and economic reality of thecompany’s business relationships, not merely its legalform. The choice of the inventory boundary is dependenton the characteristics of the company, the intendedpurpose of information, and the needs of the users. Whenchoosing the inventory boundary, a number of factorsshould be considered, such as: Organizational structures: control (operational and financial), ownership, legal agreements, jointventures, etc. Operational boundaries: on-site and off-site activities, processes, services, and impacts Business context: nature of activities, geographic loca- tions, industry sector(s), purposes of information, andusers of information More information on defining an appropriate inventory boundary is provided in chapters 2, 3, and 4. Completeness All relevant emissions sources within the chosen inventory boundary need to be accounted for so that acomprehensive and meaningful inventory is compiled. In practice, a lack of data or the cost of gatheringdata may be a limiting factor. Sometimes it istempting to define a minimum emissions accountingthreshold (often referred to as a materiality threshold)stating that a source not exceeding a certain size can be omitted from the inventory. Technically, such athreshold is simply a predefined and accepted negativebias in estim ates (i.e., an underestimate). Although it appears useful in theory, the practical implementation ofsuch a threshold is not compatible with the completenessprinciple of the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard . In order to utilize a materiality specification, the emissions from a particular source or activity would have to bequantified to ensure they were under the threshold.However, once emissions are quantified, most of thebenefit of having a threshold is lost. A threshold is often used to determine whether an error or omission is a material discrepancy or not. This is not the same as a de minimis for defining a complete inventory. Instead companies need to make a good faitheffort to provide a complete, accurate, and consistentaccounting of their GHG emissions. For cases whereemissions have not been estimated, or estimated at aninsufficient level of quality, it is important that this istransparently documented and justified. Verifiers candetermine the potential impact and relevance of the exclu-sion, or lack of quality, on the overall inventory report. More information on completeness is provided in chap- ters 7 and 10. Consistency Users of GHG information will want to track andcompare GHG emissions information over time in orderto identify trends and to assess the performance of the reporting company. The consistent application ofaccounting approaches, inventory boundary, and calcula-tion methodologies is essential to producing comparableGHG emissions data over time. The GHG information for all operations within an organization’s inventoryboundary needs to be compiled in a manner that ensuresthat the aggregate information is internally consistentand comparable over time. If there are changes in theinventory boundary, methods, data or any other factorsaffecting emission estimates, they need to be transpar-ently documented and justified. More information on consistency is provided in chapters 5 and 9. T

Transparency Transparency relates to the degree to which information on the processes, procedures, assumptions, and limita-tions of the GHG inventory are disclosed in a clear,factual, neutral, and understandable manner based onclear documentation and archives (i.e., an audit trail).Information needs to be recorded, compiled, andanalyzed in a way that enables internal reviewers andexternal verifiers to attest to its credibility. Specificexclusions or inclusions need to be clearly identified andjustified, assumptions disclosed, and appropriate refer-ences provided for the methodologies applied and thedata sources used. The information should be sufficientto enable a third party to derive the same results ifprovided with the same source data. A “transparent”report will provide a clear understanding of the issues inthe context of the reporting company and a meaningfulassessment of performance. An independent externalverification is a good way of ensuring transparency anddetermining that an appropriate audit trail has beenestablished and documentation provided. More information on transparency is provided in chap- ters 9 and 10. Accuracy Data should be sufficiently precise to enable intendedusers to make decisions with reasonable assurance thatthe reported information is credible. GHG measure-ments, estimates, or calculations should be systemicallyneither over nor under the actual emissions value, as faras can be judged, and that uncertainties are reduced asfar as practicable. The quantification process should beconducted in a manner that minimizes uncertainty.Reporting on measures taken to ensure accuracy in theaccounting of emissions can help promote credibilitywhile enhancing transparency. More information on accuracy is provided in chapter 7. As an international, values-driven retailer of skin, hair, body care, and make-up products, the Body Shop operates nearly 2,000 loca-tions, serving 51 countries in 29 languages. Achieving bothaccuracy and completeness in the GHG inventory process for sucha large, disaggregated organization, is a challenge. Unavailabledata and costly measurement processes present significantobstacles to improving emission data accuracy. For example, it isdifficult to disaggregate energy consumption information forshops located within shopping centers. Estimates for these shopsare often inaccurate, but excluding sources due to inaccuracycreates an incomplete inventory. The Body Shop, with help from the Business Leaders Initiative on Climate Change (BLICC) program, approached this problem witha two-tiered solution. First, stores were encouraged to activelypursue direct consumption data through disaggregated data ordirect monitoring. Second, if unable to obtain direct consumptiondata, stores were given standardized guidelines for estimatingemissions based on factors such as square footage, equipmenttype, and usage hours. This system replaced the prior fragmentaryapproach, provided greater accuracy, and provided a morecomplete account of emissions by including facilities that previ-ously were unable to calculate emissions. If such limitations inthe measurement processes are made transparent, users of theinformation will understand the basis of the data and the trade -off that has taken place. The Body Shop: Solving the trade-off between accuracy and completenessCHAPTER 1 GHG Accounting and Reporting Principles 9 Volkswagen is a global auto manufacturer and the largest automaker in Europe. While working on its GHG inventory,Volkswagen realized that the structure of its emission sources hadundergone considerable changes over the last seven years.Emissions from production processes, which were considered to beirrelevant at a corporate level in 1996, today constitute almost 20 percent of aggregated GHG emissions at the relevant plantsites. Examples of growing emissions sources are new sites forengine testing or the investment into magnesium die-castingequipment at certain production sites. This example shows thatemissions sources have to be regularly re-assessed to maintain acomplete inventory over time.Volkswagen: Maintaining completeness over timeGUIDANCE

10 mproving your understanding of your company’s GHG emissions by compiling a GHG inventory makes good business sense. Companies frequently cite the following five business goals as reasons for compiling a GHG inventory: Managing GHG risks and identifying reduction opportunities Public reporting and participation in voluntary GHG programs Participating in mandatory reporting programs Participating in GHG markets Recognition for early voluntary actionI2Business Goals and Inventory Design GUIDANCEGUIDANCE

Companies generally want their GHG inventory to be capable of serving multiple goals. It therefore makessense to design the process from the outset to provideinformation for a variety of different users and uses—both current and future. The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard has been designed as a comprehensive GHG accounting and reporting framework to provide the information building blocks capable of serving mostbusiness goals (see Box 1). Thus the inventory datacollected according to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard can be aggregated and disaggregated for various organizational and operational boundaries andfor different business geographic scales (state, country,Annex 1 countries, non-Annex 1 countries, facility,business unit, company, etc.). Appendix C provides an overview of various GHG programs—many of which are based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard . The guidance sections of chapters 3 and 4 provide additional information on how to designan inventory for different goals and uses. Managing GHG risks and identifying reduction opportunities Compiling a comprehensive GHG inventory improves a company’s understanding of its emissions profile and any potential GHG liability or “exposure.” Acompany’s GHG exposure is increasingly becoming amanagement issue in light of heightened scrutiny by theinsurance industry, shareholders, and the emergence ofenvironmental regulations/policies designed to reduceGHG emissions. In the context of future GHG regulations, significant GHG emissions in a company’s value chain may result inincreased costs (upstream) or reduced sales (down-stream), even if the company itself is not directly subjectto regulations. Thus investors may view significant indi-rect emissions upstream or downstream of a company’soperations as potential liabilities that need to bemanaged and reduced. A limited focus on direct emis-sions from a company’s own operations may miss majorGHG risks and opportunities, while leading to a misin-terpretation of the company’s actual GHG exposure. On a more positive note, what gets measured gets managed. Accounting for emissions can help identifythe most effective reduction opportunities. This candrive increased materials and energy efficiency as wellas the development of new products and services thatreduce the GHG impacts of customers or suppliers. Thisin turn can reduce production costs and help differen-tiate the company in an increasingly environmentallyconscious marketplace. Conducting a rigorous GHGinventory is also a prerequisite for setting an internalor public GHG target and for subsequently measuringand reporting progress.

Public reporting and participation in voluntary GHG programs As concerns over climate change grow, NGOs, investors, and other stakeholders are increasingly calling forgreater corporate disclosure of GHG information. Theyare interested in the actions companies are taking andin how the companies are positioned relative to theircompetitors in the face of emerging regulations. Inresponse, a growing number of companies are preparingstakeholder reports containing information on GHGemissions. These may be stand-alone reports on GHGemissions or broader environmental or sustainabilityreports. For example, companies preparing sustainabilityreports using the Global Reporting Initiative guidelinesshould include information on GHG emissions in accor-dance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard (GRI, 2002). Public reporting can also strengthen relation-ships with other stakeholders. For instance, companiescan improve their standing with customers and with thepublic by being recognized for participating in voluntaryGHG programs. Some countries and states have established GHG registries where companies can report GHG emissions in a public database. Registries may be administered bygovernments (e.g., U.S. Department of Energy 1605bVoluntary Reporting Program), NGOs (e.g., CaliforniaClimate Action Registry), or industry groups (e.g., WorldEconomic Forum Global GHG Registry). Many GHGprograms also provide help to companies setting volun-tary GHG targets. Most voluntary GHG programs permit or require the reporting of direct emissions from operations (includingall six GHGs), as well as indirect GHG emissions from purchased electricity. A GHG inventory prepared in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard will usually be compatible with most requirements(Appendix C provides an overview of the reportingrequirements of some GHG programs). However, sincethe accounting guidelines of many voluntary programsare periodically updated, companies planning to partici-pate are advised to contact the program administrator to check the current requirements. GUIDANCEBusiness Goals and Inventory Design CHAPTER 2 12Indirect emissions associated with the consumption of purchasedelectricity are a required element of any company’s accounting andreporting under the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard . Because purchased electricity is a major source of GHG emissions for compa-nies, it presents a significant reduction opportunity. IBM, a majorinformation technology company and a member of the WRI’s GreenPower Market Development Group, has systematically accounted forthese indirect emissions and thus identified the significant potentialto reduce them. The company has implemented a variety of strategiesthat would reduce either their demand for purchased energy or theGHG intensity of that purchased energy. One strategy has been topursue the renewable energy market to reduce the GHG intensity of itspurchased electricity. IBM succeeded in reducing its GHG emissions at its facility in Austin, Texas, even as energy use stayed relatively constant, througha contract for renewable electricity with the local utility company,Austin Energy. Starting in 2001, this five-year contract is for 5.25million kWhs of wind-power per year. This zero emission powerlowered the facility’s inventory by more than 4,100 tonnes of CO 2 compared to the previous year and represents nearly 5% of thefacility’s total electricity consumption. Company-wide, IBM’s 2002total renewable energy procurement was 66.2 million kWh, whichrepresented 1.3% of its electricity consumption worldwide and31,550 tonnes of CO 2compared to the previous year. Worldwide, IBM purchased a variety of sources of renewable energy including wind,biomass and solar. By accounting for these indirect emissions and looking for associ- ated reduction opportunities, IBM has successfully reduced animportant source of its overall GHG emissions.

Participating in mandatory reporting programs Some governments require GHG emitters to report their emissions annually. These typically focus on direct emis-sions from operations at operated or controlled facilitiesin specific geographic jurisdictions. In Europe, facilitiesfalling under the requirements of the IntegratedPollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive mustreport emissions exceeding a specified threshold for eachof the six GHGs. The reported emissions are included ina European Pollutant Emissions Register (EPER), apublicly accessible internet-based database that permitscomparisons of emissions from individual facilities orindustrial sectors in different countries (EC-DGE, 2000).In Ontario, Ontario Regulation 127 requires thereporting of GHG emissions (Ontario MOE, 2001). Participating in GHG markets Market-based approaches to reducing GHG emissionsare emerging in some parts of the world. In mostplaces, they take the form of emissions tradingprograms, although there are a number of otherapproaches adopted by countries, such as the taxationapproach used in Norway. Trading programs can beimplemented on a mandatory (e.g., the forthcoming EU ETS) or voluntary basis (e.g., CCX). Although trading programs, which determine compliance by comparing emissions with an emissions reductiontarget or cap, typically require accounting only fordirect emissions, there are exceptions. The UK ETS, forexample, requires direct entry participants to accountfor GHG emissions from the generation of purchasedelectricity (DEFRA, 2003). The CCX allows itsmembers the option of counting indirect emissions asso-ciated with electricity purchases as a supplementalreduction commitment. Other types of indirect emissionscan be more difficult to verify and may present challenges in terms of avoiding double counting. Tofacilitate independent verification, emissions tradingCHAPTER 2 Business Goals and Inventory Design 13GUIDANCE

may require participating companies to establish an audit trail for GHG information (see chapter 10). GHG trading programs are likely to impose additional layers of accounting specificity relating to whichapproach is used for setting organizational boundaries;which GHGs and sources are addressed; how baseyears are established; the type of calculation method-ology used; the choice of emission factors; and themonitoring and verification approaches employed. The broad participation and best practices incorporatedinto the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard are likely to inform the accounting requirements of emergingprograms, and have indeed done so in the past. Recognition for early voluntary action A credible inventory may help ensure that a corpora-tion’s early, voluntary emissions reductions arerecognized in future regulatory programs. To illustrate,suppose that in 2000 a company started reducing itsGHG emissions by shifting its on-site powerhouse boilerfuel from coal to landfill gas. If a mandatory GHGreduction program is later established in 2005 and itsets 2003 as the base against which reductions are tobe measured, the program might not allow the emissionsreductions achieved by the green power project prior to2003 to count toward its target. However, if a company’s voluntary emissions reductions have been accounted for and registered, they are morelikely to be recognized and taken into account whenregulations requiring reductions go into effect. Forinstance, the state of California has stated that it willuse its best efforts to ensure that organizations thatregister certified emission results with the CaliforniaClimate Action Registry receive appropriate considera-tion under any future international, federal, or stateregulatory program relating to GHG emissions.GUIDANCEBusiness Goals and Inventory Design CHAPTER 2 14For Tata Steel, Asia’s first and India’s largest integrated privatesector steel company, reducing its GHG emissions through energyefficiency is a key element of its primary business goal: theacceptability of its product in international markets. Each year, inpursuit of this goal, the company launches several energy effi-ciency projects and introduces less-GHG-intensive processes. Thecompany is also actively pursuing GHG trading markets as ameans of further improving its GHG performance. To succeed inthese efforts and be eligible for emerging trading schemes, TataSteel must have an accurate GHG inventory that includes allprocesses and activities, allows for meaningful benchmarking,measures improvements, and promotes credible reporting. Tata Steel has developed the capacity to measure its progress in reducing GHG emissions. Tata Steel’s managers have access toon-line information on energy usage, material usage, waste andbyproduct generation, and other material streams. Using thisdata and the GHG Protocol calculation tools, Tata Steel generatestwo key long-term, strategic performance indicators: specificenergy consumption (Giga calorie / tonne of crude steel) and GHGintensity (tonne of CO 2equivalent / tonne of crude steel). These indicators are key sustainability metrics in the steel sector world-wide, and help ensure market acceptability and competitiveness.Since the company adopted the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard , tracking performance has become more structured and stream-lined. This system allows Tata Steel quick and easy access to itsGHG inventory and helps the company maximize process andmaterial flow efficiencies.

CHAPTER 2 Business Goals and Inventory Design 15GUIDANCEWhen Ford Motor Company, a global automaker, embarked on an effort to understand and reduce its GHG impacts, it wanted totrack emissions with enough accuracy and detail to managethem effectively. An internal cross-functional GHG inventory teamwas formed to accomplish this goal. Although the company wasalready reporting basic energy and carbon dioxide data at thecorporate level, a more detailed understanding of these emis-sions was essential to set and measure progress againstperformance targets and evaluate potential participation inexternal trading schemes. For several weeks, the team worked on creating a more compre- hensive inventory for stationary combustion sources, and quicklyfound a pattern emerging. All too often team members left meet-ings with as many questions as answers, and the same questionskept coming up from one week to the next. How should theydraw boundaries? How do they account for acquisitions anddivestitures? What emission factors should be used? And perhaps most importantly, how could their methodology be deemed credible with stakeholders? Although the team had noshortage of opinions, there also seemed to be no clearly right orwrong answers. TheGHG Protocol Corporate Standard helped answer many of these questions and the Ford Motor Company now has a morerobust GHG inventory that can be continually improved to fulfillits rapidly emerging GHG management needs. Since adopting theGHG Protocol Corporate Standard , Ford has expanded the coverage of its public reporting to all of its brands globally; it nowincludes direct emissions from sources it owns or controls andindirect emissions resulting from the generation of purchasedelectricity, heat, or steam. In addition, Ford is a founding memberof the Chicago Climate Exchange, which uses some of the GHG Protocol calculation tools for emissions reporting purposes.Ford Motor Company: Experiences using the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard

STANDARD 16usiness operations vary in their legal and organizational structures; they include wholly owned operations, incorporated and non-incorporated joint ventures, subsidiaries, and others. For the purposes of financial accounting,they are treated according to established rules that depend on the structure of theorganization and the relationships among the parties involved. In setting organi-zational boundaries, a company selects an approach for consolidating GHGemissions and then consistently applies the selected approach to define thosebusinesses and operations that constitute the company for the purpose ofaccounting and reporting GHG emissions. B3Setting Organizational Boundaries GUIDANCESTANDARD

For corporate reporting, two distinct approaches can be used to consolidate GHG emissions: the equity share andthe control approaches. Companies shall account for andreport their consolidated GHG data according to eitherthe equity share or control approach as presented below.If the reporting company wholly owns all its operations,its organizational boundary will be the same whicheverapproach is used. 1For companies with joint operations, the organizational boundary and the resulting emissionsmay differ depending on the approach used. In bothwholly owned and joint operations, the choice ofapproach may change how emissions are categorizedwhen operational boundaries are set (see chapter 4). Equity share approach Under the equity share approach, a company accounts forGHG emissions from operations according to its share ofequity in the operation. The equity share reflects economicinterest, which is the extent of rights a company has to therisks and rewards flowing from an operation. Typically, theshare of economic risks and rewards in an operation isaligned with the company’s percentage ownership of thatoperation, and equity share will normally be the same asthe ownership percentage. Where this is not the case, theeconomic substance of the relationship the company haswith the operation always overrides the legal ownershipform to ensure that equity share reflects the percentageof economic interest. The principle of economicsubstance taking precedent over legal form is consistentwith international financial reporting standards. Thestaff preparing the inventory may therefore need toconsult with the company’s accounting or legal staff toensure that the appropriate equity share per centage is applied for each joint operation (see Table 1 for definitionsof financial accounting categories). Control approach Under the control approach, a company accounts for 100 percent of the GHG emissions from operations overwhich it has control. It does not account for GHG emis-sions from operations in which it owns an interest buthas no control. Control can be defined in either financialor operational terms. When using the control approachto consolidate GHG emissions, companies shall choosebetween either the operational control or financialcontrol criteria. In most cases, whether an operation is controlled by the company or not does not vary based on whether the finan-cial control or operational control criterion is used. Anotable exception is the oil and gas industry, which oftenhas complex ownership / operatorship structures. Thus,the choice of control criterion in the oil and gas industrycan have substantial consequences for a company’s GHG inventory. In making this choice, companies shouldtake into account how GHG emissions accounting andreporting can best be geared to the requirements ofemissions reporting and trading schemes, how it can bealigned with financial and environmental reporting,and which criterion best reflects the company’s actualpower of control.  Financial Control. The company has financial control over the operation if the former has the ability to directthe financial and operating policies of the latter with aview to gaining economic benefits from its activities. 2 For example, financial control usually exists if thecompany has the right to the majority of benefits of theoperation, however these rights are conveyed. Similarly,a company is considered to financially control anoperation if it retains the majority risks and rewardsof ownership of the operation’s assets. Under this criterion, the economic substance of the relationship between the company and the operationtakes precedence over the legal ownership status, sothat the company may have financial control over theoperation even if it has less than a 50 percent interestin that operation. In assessing the economic substanceof the relationship, the impact of potential votingrights, including both those held by the company andthose held by other parties, is also taken into account.This criterion is consistent with international financialaccounting standards; therefore, a company has finan-cial control over an operation for GHG accountingpurposes if the operation is considered as a groupcompany or subsidiary for the purpose of financialCHAPTER 3 Setting Organizational Boundaries 17STANDARD 

--- Page 20 of 116 ---

consolidation, i.e., if the operation is fully consolidated in financial accounts. If this criterion is chosen todetermine control, emissions from joint ventures wherepartners have joint financial control are accounted forbased on the equity share approach (see Table 1 fordefinitions of financial accounting categories).  Operational Control. A company has operational control over an operation if the former or one of itssubsidiaries (see Table 1 for definitions of financialaccounting categories) has the full authority to introduce and implement its operating policies at theoperation. This criterion is consistent with the currentaccounting and reporting practice of many compa-nies that report on emissions from facilities, whichthey operate (i.e., for which they hold the operatinglicense). It is expected that except in very rarecircumstances, if the company or one of itssubsidiaries is the operator of a facility, it will havethe full authority to introduce and implement itsoperating policies and thus has operational control. Under the operational control approach, a company accounts for 100% of emissions from operations overwhich it or one of its subsidiaries has operational control. It should be emphasized that having operational control does not mean that a company necessarilyhas authority to make all decisions concerning anoperation. For example, big capital investments willlikely require the approval of all the partners thathave joint financial control. Operational control doesmean that a company has the authority to introduceand implement its operating policies. More information on the relevance and application of the operational control criterion is provided inpetroleum industry guidelines for reporting GHGemissions (IPIECA, 2003). Sometimes a company can have joint financial control over an operation, but not operational control. In suchcases, the company would need to look at the contractualarrangements to determine whether any one of the part-ners has the authority to introduce and implement itsoperating policies at the operation and thus has theresponsibility to report emissions under operationalcontrol. If the operation itself will introduce and imple-ment its own operating policies, the partners with jointfinancial control over the operation will not report anyemissions under operational control.Table 2 in the guidance section of this chapter illustrates the selection of a consolidation approach at the corpo-rate level and the identification of which joint operationswill be in the organizational boundary depending on thechoice of the consolidation approach. Consolidation at multiple levels The consolidation of GHG emissions data will only resultin consistent data if all levels of the organization followthe same consolidation policy. In the first step, themanagement of the parent company has to decide on aconsolidation approach (i.e., either the equity share orthe financial or operational control approach). Once acorporate consolidation policy has been selected, it shallbe applied to all levels of the organization. State-ownership The rules provided in this chapter shall also be appliedto account for GHG emissions from industry jointoperations that involve state ownership or a mix ofprivate/ state ownership. STANDARD CHAPTER 3 18Setting Organizational Boundaries BP reports GHG emissions on an equity share basis, includingthose operations where BP has an interest, but where BP is not theoperator. In determining the extent of the equity share reportingboundary BP seeks to achieve close alignment with financialaccounting procedures. BP’s equity share boundary includes alloperations undertaken by BP and its subsidiaries, joint venturesand associated undertakings as determined by their treatment inthe financial accounts. Fixed asset investments, i.e., where BPhas limited influence, are not included. GHG emissions from facilities in which BP has an equity share are estimated according to the requirements of the BP GroupReporting Guidelines for Environmental Performance (BP 2000).In those facilities where BP has an equity share but is not theoperator, GHG emissions data may be obtained directly from theoperating company using a methodology consistent with the BPGuidelines, or is calculated by BP using activity data provided bythe operator. BP reports its equity share GHG emissions every year. Since 2000, independent external auditors have expressed the opinionthat the reported total has been found to be free from materialmisstatement when audited against the BP Guidelines.BP: Reporting on the basis of equity share

CHAPTER 3 Setting Organizational Boundaries 19 TABLE 1. Financial accounting categories ACCOUNTING CATEGORY Group companies / subsidiaries Associated / affiliatedcompanies Non-incorporated joint ventures /partnerships /operations wherepartners have jointfinancial control Fixed asset investments FranchisesFINANCIAL ACCOUNTING DEFINITION The parent company has the ability to direct the financial and operating policies of the company with a view to gainingeconomic benefits from its activities. Normally, this categoryalso includes incorporated and non-incorporated joint venturesand partnerships over which the parent company has financialcontrol. Group companies/ subsidiaries are fully consolidated,which implies that 100 percent of the subsidiary’s income,expenses, assets, and liabilities are taken into the parentcompany’s profit and loss account and balance sheet, respec-tively. Where the parent’s interest does not equal 100 percent,the consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheetshows a deduction for the profits and net assets belonging tominority owners. The parent company has significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the company, but does not have finan-cial control. Normally, this category also includes incorporatedand non-incorporated joint ventures and partnerships over whichthe parent company has significant influence, but not financialcontrol. Financial accounting applies the equity share method to associated/ affiliated companies, which recognizes the parentcompany’s share of the associate’s profits and net assets. Joint ventures/ partnerships/operations are proportionally consolidated, i.e., each partner accounts for their propor-tionate interest of the joint venture’s income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. The parent company has neither significant influence nor financial control. This category also includes incorporated and non-incorporated joint ventures and partnerships over which the parentcompany has neither significant influence nor financial control.Financial accounting applies the cost/ dividend method to fixedasset investments. This implies that only dividends received arerecognized as income and the investment is carried at cost. Franchises are separate legal entities. In most cases, the fran- chiser will not have equity rights or control over the franchise.Therefore, franchises should not be included in consolidation ofGHG emissions data. However, if the franchiser does have equityrights or operational/ financial control, then the same rules for consolidation under the equity or control approaches apply.ACCOUNTING FOR GHG EMISSIONS ACCORDING TO GHG PROTOCOL CORPORATE STANDARD BASED ON EQUITY SHARE Equity share of GHG emissions Equity share of GHG emissions Equity share of GHG emissions 0% Equity share of GHG emissionsBASED ON FINANCIAL CONTROL 100% of GHG emissions 0% of GHG emissions Equity share of GHG emissions 0% 100% of GHG emissionsSTANDARD NOTE: T able 1 is based on a comparison of UK, US, Netherlands and International Financial Reporting Standards (KPMG, 2000).

hen planning the consolidation of GHG data, it is important to distinguish between GHG accountingand GHG reporting. GHG accounting concerns the recognition and consolidation of GHG emissions from operations in which a parent company holds an interest(either control or equity) and linking the data to specificoperations, sites, geographic locations, businessprocesses, and owners. GHG reporting, on the otherhand, concerns the presentation of GHG data in formatstailored to the needs of various reporting uses and users. Most companies have several goals for GHG reporting, e.g., official government reporting requirements, emissionstrading programs, or public reporting (see chapter 2).In developing a GHG accounting system, a fundamentalconsideration is to ensure that the system is capable ofmeeting a range of reporting requirements. Ensuringthat data are collected and recorded at a sufficientlydisaggregated level, and capable of being consolidatedin various forms, will provide companies with maximumflexibility to meet a range of reporting requirements. Double counting When two or more companies hold interests in the samejoint operation and use different consolidation approaches(e.g., Company A follows the equity share approach whileCompany B uses the financial control approach), emissionsfrom that joint operation could be double counted. Thismay not matter for voluntary corporate public reportingas long as there is adequate disclosure from the companyon its consolidation approach. However, double countingof emissions needs to be avoided in trading schemes andcertain mandatory government reporting programs. Reporting goals and level of consolidation Reporting requirements for GHG data exist at variouslevels, from a specific local facility level to a moreaggregated corporate level. Examples of drivers forvarious levels of reporting include: Official government reporting programs or certain emissions trading programs may require GHG data tobe reported at a facility level. In these cases, consoli-dation of GHG data at a corporate level is not relevant Government reporting and trading programs may require that data be consolidated within certaingeographic and operational boundaries (e.g., the U.K.Emissions Trading Scheme) To demonstrate the company’s account to wider stake- holders, companies may engage in voluntary publicreporting, consolidating GHG data at a corporate levelin order to show the GHG emissions of their entirebusiness activities. Contracts that cover GHG emissions To clarify ownership (rights) and responsibility (obliga-tions) issues, companies involved in joint operations maydraw up contracts that specify how the ownership ofemissions or the responsibility for managing emissionsand associated risk is distributed between the parties.Where such arrangements exist, companies may option-ally provide a description of the contractual arrangementand include information on allocation of CO 2related risks and obligations (see Chapter 9). Using the equity share or control approach Different inventory reporting goals may require differentdata sets. Thus companies may need to account for theirGHG emissions using both the equity share and thecontrol approaches. The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard makes no recommendation as to whether voluntarypublic GHG emissions reporting should be based on theequity share or any of the two control approaches, butencourages companies to account for their emissionsapplying the equity share and a control approach sepa-rately. Companies need to decide on the approach bestsuited to their business activities and GHG accountingand reporting requirements. Examples of how these maydrive the choice of approach include the following:  Reflection of commercial reality. It can be argued that a company that derives an economic profit from acertain activity should take ownership for any GHGemissions generated by the activity. This is achievedby using the equity share approach, since thisapproach assigns ownership for GHG emissions on thebasis of economic interest in a business activity. Thecontrol approaches do not always reflect the full GHGemissions portfolio of a company’s business activities,but have the advantage that a company takes fullownership of all GHG emissions that it can directly influence and reduce.GUIDANCESetting Organizational Boundaries CHAPTER 3 20W

Government reporting and emissions trading programs. Government regulatory programs will always need to monitor and enforce compliance. Since complianceresponsibility generally falls to the operator (notequity holders or the group company that has financialcontrol), governments will usually require reportingon the basis of operational control, either through afacility level-based system or involving the consolida-tion of data within certain geographical boundaries(e.g. the EU ETS will allocate emission permits to theoperators of certain installations).  Liability and risk management. While reporting and compliance with regulations will most likely continueto be based directly on operational control, the ulti-mate financial liability will often rest with the groupcompany that holds an equity share in the operation orhas financial control over it. Hence, for assessing risk,GHG reporting on the basis of the equity share andfinancial control approaches provides a more completepicture. The equity share approach is likely to result inthe most comprehensive coverage of liability and risks.In the future, companies might incur liabilities forGHG emissions produced by joint operations in whichthey have an interest, but over which they do not havefinancial control. For example, a company that is anequity shareholder in an operation but has no financialcontrol over it might face demands by the companieswith a controlling share to cover its requisite share ofGHG compliance costs.  Alignment with financial accounting. Future financial accounting standards may treat GHG emissions asliabilities and emissions allowances / credits as assets.To assess the assets and liabilities a company createsby its joint operations, the same consolidation rules that are used in financial accounting should be appliedin GHG accounting. The equity share and financialcontrol approaches result in closer align ment between GHG accounting and financial accounting.  Management information and performance tracking. For the purpose of performance tracking, the control approaches seem to be more appropriate sincemanagers can only be held accountable for activitiesunder their control. Cost of administration and data access. The equity share approach can result in higher administrativecosts than the control approach, since it can be diffi-cult and time consuming to collect GHG emissionsdata from joint operations not under the control of thereporting company. Companies are likely to havebetter access to operational data and therefore greaterability to ensure that it meets minimum quality standards when reporting on the basis of control.  Completeness of reporting. Companies might find it difficult to demonstrate completeness of reportingwhen the operational control criterion is adopted,since there are unlikely to be any matching records orlists of financial assets to verify the operations thatare included in the organizational boundary.CHAPTER 3 Setting Organizational Boundaries 21GUIDANCE In the oil and gas industry, ownership and control structures areoften complex. A group may own less than 50 percent of aventure’s equity capital but have operational control over theventure. On the other hand, in some situations, a group may holda majority interest in a venture without being able to exert opera-tional control, for example, when a minority partner has a vetovote at the board level. Because of these complex ownership andcontrol structures, Royal Dutch/Shell, a global group of energyand petrochemical companies, has chosen to report its GHG emis-sions on the basis of operational control. By reporting 100 percentof GHG emissions from all ventures under its operational control,irrespective of its share in the ventures’ equity capital, RoyalDutch/Shell can ensure that GHG emissions reporting is in linewith its operational policy including its Health, Safety andEnvironmental Performance Monitoring and Reporting Guidelines.Using the operational control approach, the group generates datathat is consistent, reliable, and meets its quality standards.

STANDARD 24fter a company has determined its organizational boundaries in terms of the operations that it owns or controls, it then sets its operational boundaries. This involves identifying emissions associated with its operations,categorizing them as direct and indirect emissions, and choosing the scope ofaccounting and reporting for indirect emissions. A4Setting Operational Boundaries GUIDANCESTANDARD

--- Page 27 of 116 ---

For effective and innovative GHG management, setting operational boundaries that are comprehensive withrespect to direct and indirect emissions will help acompany better manage the full spectrum of GHG risksand opportunities that exist along its value chain. Direct GHG emissions are emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the company.1 Indirect GHG emissions are emissions that are a consequence of the activities of the company but occurat sources owned or controlled by another company. What is classified as direct and indirect emissions is dependent on the consolidation approach (equity shareor control) selected for setting the organizationalboundary (see chapter 3). Figure 2 below shows therelationship between the organizational and operationalboundaries of a company. Introducing the concept of “ scope” To help delineate direct and indirect emission sources,improve transparency, and provide utility for differenttypes of organizations and different types of climate poli-cies and business goals, three “scopes” (scope 1, scope2, and scope 3) are defined for GHG accounting andreporting purposes. Scopes 1 and 2 are carefully definedin this standard to ensure that two or more companieswill not account for emissions in the same scope. Thismakes the scopes amenable for use in GHG programswhere double counting matters. Companies shall separately account for and report on scopes 1 and 2 at a minimum.Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions Direct GHG emissions occur from sources that are owned or controlled by the company, for example,emissions from combustion in owned or controlledboilers, fur naces, vehicles, etc.; emissions from chemical production in owned or controlled process equipment. Direct CO 2emissions from the combustion of biomass shall not be included in scope 1 but reported separately(see chapter 9). GHG emissions not covered by the Kyoto Protocol, e.g. CFCs, NOx, etc. shall not be included in scope 1 but maybe reported separately (see chapter 9). Scope 2: Electricity indirect GHG emissions Scope 2 accounts for GHG emissions from the genera-tion of purchased electricity 2consumed by the company. Purchased electricity is defined as electricity that ispurchased or otherwise brought into the organizationalboundary of the company. Scope 2 emissions physicallyoccur at the facility where electricity is generated. Scope 3: Other indirect GHG emissions Scope 3 is an optional reporting category that allowsfor the treatment of all other indirect emissions. Scope3 emissions are a consequence of the activities of thecompany, but occur from sources not owned orcontrolled by the company. Some examples of scope 3activities are extraction and production of purchasedmaterials; transportation of purchased fuels; and use ofsold products and services.

n operational boundary defines the scope of direct and indirect emissions for operations that fall withina company’s established organizational boundary. The operational boundary (scope 1, scope 2, scope 3) isdecided at the corporate level after setting the organiza-tional boundary. The selected operational boundary is thenuniformly applied to identify and categorize direct andindirect emissions at each operational level (see Box 2).The established organizational and operational bound-aries together constitute a company’s inventory boundary.Accounting and reporting on scopes Companies account for and report emissions from scope 1 and 2 separately. Companies may furthersubdivide emissions data within scopes where this aidstransparency or facilitates comparability over time. For example, they may subdivide data by businessunit/facility, country, source type (stationary combustion,process, fugitive, etc.), and activity type (production of electricity, consumption of electricity, generation orpurchased electricity that is sold to end users, etc.). In addition to the six Kyoto gases, companies may also provide emissions data for other GHGs (e.g., MontrealProtocol gases) to give context to changes in emissionlevels of Kyoto Protocol gases. Switching from a CFCto HFC, for example, will increase emissions of KyotoProtocol gases. Information on emissions of GHGs otherthan the six Kyoto gases may be reported separatelyfrom the scopes in a GHG public report. Together the three scopes provide a comprehensive accounting framework for managing and reducingdirect and indirect emissions. Figure 3 provides anoverview of the relationship between the scopes and the activities that generate direct and indirect emissionsalong a company’s value chain. A company can benefit from efficiency gains throughout the value chain. Even without any policy drivers,accounting for GHG emissions along the value chain mayreveal potential for greater efficiency and lower costs(e.g., the use of fly ash as a clinker substitute in themanufacture of cement that reduces downstream emis-sions from processing of waste fly ash, and upstream 26Setting Operational Boundaries CHAPTER 4GUIDANCEBOX 2. Organizational and operational boundaries Organization X is a parent company that has full ownership andfinancial control of operations A and B, but only a 30% non-operated interest and no financial control in operation C. Setting Organizational Boundary: X would decide whether to account for GHG emissions by equity share or financial control. Ifthe choice is equity share, X would include A and B, as well as 30%of C’s emissions. If the approach chosen is financial control, Xwould count only A and B’s emissions as relevant and subject toconsolidation. Once this has been decided, the organizationalboundary has been defined. Setting Operational Boundary: Once the organizational boundary is set, X then needs to decide, on the basis of its business goals,whether to account only for scope 1 and scope 2, or whether toinclude relevant scope 3 categories for its operations. Operations A, B and C (if the equity approach is selected) account for the GHG emissions in the scopes chosen by X, i.e., they apply thecorporate policy in drawing up their operational boundaries.

emissions from producing clinker). Even if such “win- win” options are not available, indirect emissionsreductions may still be more cost effective to accomplishthan scope 1 reductions. Thus accounting for indirectemissions can help identify where to allocate limitedresources in a way that maximizes GHG reduction andreturn on investment. Appendix D lists GHG sources and activities along the value chain by scopes for various industry sectors. Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions Companies report GHG emissions from sources they ownor control as scope 1. Direct GHG emissions are princi-pally the result of the following types of activitiesundertaken by the company:  Generation of electricity, heat, or steam. These emis- sions result from combustion of fuels in stationarysources, e.g., boilers, furnaces, turbines  Physical or chemical processing.3Most of these emis- sions result from manufacture or processing of chemicalsand materials, e.g., cement, aluminum, adipic acid,ammonia manufacture, and waste processing  Transportation of materials, products, waste, and employees. These emissions result from the combus- tion of fuels in company owned/controlled mobilecombustion sources (e.g., trucks, trains, ships,airplanes, buses, and cars)  Fugitive emissions. These emissions result from inten- tional or unintentional releases, e.g., equipment leaksfrom joints, seals, packing, and gaskets; methaneemissions from coal mines and venting; hydrofluoro-carbon (HFC) emissions during the use of refrigerationand air conditioning equipment; and methane leakagesfrom gas transport. SALE OF OWN-GENERATED ELECTRICITY Emissions associated with the sale of own-generatedelectricity to another company are not deducted/nettedfrom scope 1. This treatment of sold electricity is consis-tent with how other sold GHG intensive products areaccounted, e.g., emissions from the production of soldclinker by a cement company or the production of scrapsteel by an iron and steel company are not subtractedfrom their scope 1 emissions. Emissions associated withthe sale/transfer of own-generated electricity may bereported in optional information (see chapter 9).Scope 2: Electricity indirect GHG emissions Companies report the emissions from the generation ofpurchased electricity that is consumed in its owned orcontrolled equipment or operations as scope 2. Scope 2emissions are a special category of indirect emissions. Formany companies, purchased electricity represents one ofthe largest sources of GHG emissions and the most signifi-cant opportunity to reduce these emissions. Accountingfor scope 2 emissions allows companies to assess the risksand opportunities associated with changing electricity andGHG emissions costs. Another important reason forcompanies to track these emissions is that the informationmay be needed for some GHG programs. Companies can reduce their use of electricity by investing in energy efficient technologies and energy conservation.Additionally, emerging green power markets 4provide opportunities for some companies to switch to less GHGintensive sources of electricity. Companies can also installan efficient on site co-generation plant, particularly if itreplaces the purchase of more GHG intensive electricityfrom the grid or electricity supplier. Reporting of scope 2emissions allows transparent accounting of GHG emis-sions and reductions associated with such opportunities. INDIRECT EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION Electric utility companies often purchase electricity from independent power generators or the grid and resell it toend-consumers through a transmission and distribution(T&D) system. 5A portion of the electricity purchased by a utility company is consumed (T&D loss) during itstransmission and distribution to end-consumers (see Box 3). Consistent with the scope 2 definition, emissions from the generation of purchased electricity that is consumedduring transmission and distribution are reported inscope 2 by the company that owns or controls the T&Doperation. End consumers of the purchased electricity donot report indirect emissions associated with T&D lossesin scope 2 because they do not own or control the T&Doperation where the electricity is consumed (T&D loss). CHAPTER 4 Setting Operational Boundaries 27GUIDANCE BOX 3. Electricity balance Purchased electricity consumed by the utility company during T&D + Purchased electricity consumed by end consumersGENERATED ELECTRICITY=

This approach ensures that there is no double counting within scope 2 since only the T&D utility company willaccount for indirect emissions associated with T&Dlosses in scope 2. Another advantage of this approach isthat it adds simplicity to the reporting of scope 2 emis-sions by allowing the use of commonly available emissionfactors that in most cases do not include T&D losses.End consumers may, however, report their indirect emis-sions associated with T&D losses in scope 3 under thecategory “generation of electricity consumed in a T&D system.” Appendix A provides more guidance onaccounting for emissions associated with T&D losses. OTHER ELECTRICITY-RELATED INDIRECT EMISSIONS Indirect emissions from activities upstream of acompany’s electricity provider (e.g., exploration, drilling,flaring, transportation) are reported under scope 3.Emissions from the generation of electricity that has beenpurchased for resale to end-users are reported in scope 3under the category “generation of electricity that ispurchased and then resold to end users.” Emissions fromthe generation of purchased electricity for resale to non-end-users (e.g., electricity traders) may be reported sepa-rately from scope 3 in “optional information.” The following two examples illustrate how GHG emissions are accounted for from the generation, sale, and purchase of electricity.Example one (Figure 4): Company A is an independent power generator that owns a power generation plant.The power plant produces 100 MWh of electricity andreleases 20 tonnes of emissions per year. Company B is an electricity trader and has a supply contract withcompany A to purchase all its electricity. Company B re-sells the purchased electricity (100 MWh) to company C,a utility company that owns / controls the T&D system.Company C consumes 5 MWh of electricity in its T&Dsystem and sells the remaining 95 MWh to company D.Company D is an end user who consumes the purchasedelectricity (95 MWh) in its own operations. Company Areports its direct emissions from power generation under scope 1. Company B reports emissions from thepurchased electricity sold to a non-end-user as optionalinformation separately from scope 3. Company C reportsthe indirect emissions from the generation of the part ofthe purchased electricity that is sold to the end-userunder scope 3 and the part of the purchased electricitythat it consumes in its T&D system under scope 2. End-user D reports the indirect emissions associated with itsown consumption of purchased electricity under scope 2and can optionally report emissions associated withupstream T&D losses in scope 3. Figure 4 shows theaccounting of emissions associated with these transactions. Example two: Company D installs a co-generation unit and sells surplus electricity to a neighboring company Efor its consumption. Company D reports all direct emis-sions from the co-generation unit under scope 1. Indirectemissions from the generation of electricity for export toE are reported by D under optional information separatelyGUIDANCESetting Operational Boundaries CHAPTER 4 28Seattle City Light (SCL), Seattle’s municipal utility company, sellselectricity to its end-use customers that is either produced at itsown hydropower facilities, purchased through long-term contracts,or purchased on the short-term market. SCL used the first edition oftheGHG Protocol Corporate Standard to estimate its year 2000 and year 2002 GHG emissions, and emissions associated with genera-tion of net purchased electricity sold to end-users was an importantcomponent of that inventory. SCL tracks and reports the amount ofelectricity sold to end-users on a monthly and annual basis. SCL calculates net purchases from the market (brokers and other utility companies) by subtracting sales to the market frompurchases from the market, measured in MWh. This allows acomplete accounting of all emissions impacts from its entire oper-ation, including interactions with the market and end-users. On anannual basis, SCL produces more electricity than there is end-usedemand, but the production does not match load in all months. So SCL accounts for both purchases from the market and sales into themarket. SCL also includes the scope 3 upstream emissions fromnatural gas production and delivery, operation of SCL facilities,vehicle fuel use, and airline travel. SCL believes that sales to end-users are a critical part of the emis- sions profile for an electric utility company. Utility companies needto provide information on their emissions profile to educate end-users and adequately represent the impact of their business, theproviding of electricity. End-use customers need to rely on theirutility company to provide electricity, and except in some instances(green power programs), do not have a choice in where their elec-tricity is purchased. SCL meets a customer need by providingemissions information to customers who are doing their own emis-sions inventory.

from scope 3. Company E reports indirect emissions associated with the consumption of electricity purchasedfrom the company D’s co-generation unit under scope 2. For more guidance, see Appendix A on accounting for indirect emissions from purchased electricity. Scope 3: Other indirect GHG emissions Scope 3 is optional, but it provides an opportunity to beinnovative in GHG management. Companies may want tofocus on accounting for and reporting those activities thatare relevant to their business and goals, and for which theyhave reliable information. Since companies have discretionover which categories they choose to report, scope 3 maynot lend itself well to comparisons across companies. Thissection provides an indicative list of scope 3 categoriesand includes case studies on some of the categories. Some of these activities will be included under scope 1 if the pertinent emission sources are owned or controlled by thecompany (e.g., if the transportation of products is done invehicles owned or controlled by the company). To determineif an activity falls within scope 1 or scope 3, the companyshould refer to the selected consolidation approach (equityor control) used in setting its organizational boundaries. Extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels 6 Transport-related activities Transportation of purchased materials or goods Transportation of purchased fuels Employee business travel Employees commuting to and from work Transportation of sold products Transportation of waste Electricity-related activities not included in scope 2 (see Appendix A) Extraction, production, and transportation of fuels consumed in the generation of electricity (either purchased or own generated by the reporting company) Purchase of electricity that is sold to an end user (reported by utility company) Generation of electricity that is consumed in a T&Dsystem (reported by end-user) Leased assets, franchises, and outsourced activities— emissions from such contractual arrangements areonly classified as scope 3 if the selected consolidationapproach (equity or control) does not apply to them.Clarification on the classification of leased assetsshould be obtained from the company accountant (seesection on leases below). Use of sold products and services Waste disposal Disposal of waste generated in operations Disposal of waste generated in the production of purchased materials and fuels Disposal of sold products at the end of their life ACCOUNTING FOR SCOPE 3 EMISSIONS Accounting for scope 3 emissions need not involve afull-blown GHG life cycle analysis of all products andoperations. Usually it is valuable to focus on one or twomajor GHG-generating activities. Although it is diffi-cult to provide generic guidance on which scope 3emissions to include in an inventory, some general stepscan be articulated: CHAPTER 4 Setting Operational Boundaries 29GUIDANCE ➡➡ ➡➡➡ ➡ ➡ ➡ ➡A’s Scope 1 emissions = 20t emission factor = 0.2 t/MWh100 MWh 100 MWh 95 MWh emission factor = 0.2 t/MWhemission factor = 0.2 t/MWh B’s Optional Information = 20t C’s Scope 3 emissions = 19t D’s Scope 3 emissions = 1tC’s Scope 2 emissions = 1tD’s Scope 2 emissions = 19t Generator A End-user DElectricity Trader BUtility Company CFIGURE 4.

1. Describe the value chain. Because the assessment of scope 3 emissions does not require a full life cycleassessment, it is important, for the sake of transparency,to provide a general description of the value chain andthe associated GHG sources. For this step, the scope 3categories listed can be used as a checklist. Companiesusually face choices on how many levels up- and down-stream to include in scope 3. Consideration of thecompany’s inventory or business goals and relevance ofthe various scope 3 categories will guide these choices. 2. Determine which scope 3 categories are relevant. Only some types of upstream or downstream emissions cate-gories might be relevant to the company. They may berelevant for several reasons: They are large (or believed to be large) relative to the company’s scope 1 and scope 2 emissions They contribute to the company’s GHG risk exposure They are deemed critical by key stakeholders (e.g., feedback from customers, suppliers, investors, or civil society) There are potential emissions reductions that could be undertaken or influenced by the company. The following examples may help decide which scope 3 categories are relevant to the company. If fossil fuel or electricity is required to use the company’s products, product use phase emissions maybe a relevant category to report. This may be espe-cially important if the company can influence productdesign attributes (e.g., energy efficiency) or customerbehavior in ways that reduce GHG emissions duringthe use of the products.

Through participation in the Business Leaders Initiative onClimate Change, the company found that 98 percent of its emissionsin Sweden originate from the transport of goods via outsourcedpartner transportation firms. Each partner is required, as an elementof the subcontract payment scheme, to enter data on vehicles used,distance traveled, fuel efficiency, and background data. This data isused to calculate total emissions via a tailored calculation tool foroutsourced transportation which gives a detailed picture of its scope3 emissions. Linking data to specific carriers allows the company toscreen individual carriers for environmental performance and affectdecisions based on each carrier’s emissions performance, which isseen through scope 3 as DHL’s own performance. By including scope 3 and promoting GHG reductions throughout the value chain, DHL Express Nordic increased the relevance of itsemissions footprint, expanded opportunities for reducing itsimpacts and improved its ability to recognize cost saving opportu-nities. Without scope 3, DHL Express Nordic would have lackedmuch of the information needed to be able to understand and effec-tively manage its emissions.

CHAPTER 4 Setting Operational Boundaries 31 Outsourced activities are often candidates for scope 3 emissions assessments. It may be particularly importantto include these when a previously outsourced activitycontributed significantly to a company’s scope 1 orscope 2 emissions. If GHG-intensive materials represent a significant fraction of the weight or composition of a productused or manufactured (e.g., cement, aluminum),companies may want to examine whether there areopportunities to reduce their consumption of theproduct or to substitute less GHG-intensive materials. Large manufacturing companies may have significant emissions related to transporting purchased materialsto centralized production facilities. Commodity and consumer product companies may want to account for GHGs from transporting rawmaterials, products, and waste. Service sector companies may want to report on emis- sions from employee business travel; this emissionssource is not as likely to be significant for other kindsof companies (e.g., manufacturing companies). 3. Identify partners along the value chain. Identify any partners that contribute potentiallysignificant amounts of GHGs along the value chain(e.g., customers/users, product designers/manufac-turers, energy providers, etc.). This is important whentrying to identify sources, obtain relevant data, andcalculate emissions. 4. Quantify scope 3 emissions. While data availability and reliability may influence which scope 3 activitiesare included in the inventory, it is accepted that dataaccuracy may be lower. It may be more important to understand the relative magnitude of and possiblechanges to scope 3 activities. Emission estimates areacceptable as long as there is transparency with regardto the estimation approach, and the data used for theanalysis are adequate to support the objectives of theinventory. Verification of scope 3 emissions will oftenbe difficult and may only be considered if data is ofreliable quality. Leased assets, outsourcing, and franchises The selected consolidation approach (equity share or oneof the control approaches) is also applied to account forand categorize direct and indirect GHG emissions fromcontractual arrangements such as leased assets,outsourcing, and franchises. If the selected equity orcontrol approach does not apply, then the company mayaccount for emissions from the leased assets,outsourcing, and franchises under scope 3. Specific guid-ance on leased assets is provided below:  USING EQUITY SHARE OR FINANCIAL CONTROL: The lessee only accounts for emissions from leased assetsthat are treated as wholly owned assets in financialaccounting and are recorded as such on the balancesheet (i.e., finance or capital leases).IKEA, an international home furniture and furnishings retailer,decided to include scope 3 emissions from customer travel whenit became clear, through participation in the Business LeadersInitiative on Climate Change (BLICC) program, that these emis-sions were large relative its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions.Furthermore, these emissions are particularly relevant to IKEA’sstore business model. Customer travel to its stores, often fromlong distances, is directly affected by IKEA’s choice of store loca-tion and the warehouse shopping concept. Customer transportation emission calculations were based on customer surveys at selected stores. Customers were asked forthe distance they traveled to the store (based on home postalcode), the number of customers in their car, the number of otherstores they intended to visit at that shopping center that day, andwhether they had access to public transportation to the store.Extrapolating this data to all IKEA stores and multiplying distanceby average vehicle efficiencies for each country, the companycalculated that 66 percent of its emissions inventory was fromscope 3 customer travel. Based on this information, IKEA will havesignificant influence over future scope 3 emissions by consideringGHG emissions when developing public transportation optionsand home delivery services for its existing and new stores.IKEA: Customer transportation to and from its retail storesGUIDANCE

GUIDANCESetting Operational Boundaries CHAPTER 4 32USING OPERATIONAL CONTROL: The lessee only accounts for emissions from leased assets that it oper-ates (i.e., if the operational control criterion applies). Guidance on which leased assets are operating and which are finance leases should be obtained from thecompany accountant. In general, in a finance lease, anorganization assumes all rewards and risks from theleased asset, and the asset is treated as wholly ownedand is recorded as such on the balance sheet. Allleased assets that do not meet those criteria are oper-ating leases. Figure 5 illustrates the application ofconsolidation criteria to account for emissions fromleased assets.Double counting Concern is often expressed that accounting for indirectemissions will lead to double counting when twodifferent companies include the same emissions in theirrespective inventories. Whether or not double countingoccurs depends on how consistently companies withshared ownership or trading program administratorschoose the same approach (equity or control) to set theorganizational boundaries. Whether or not doublecounting matters, depends on how the reported informa-tion is used. Double counting needs to be avoided when compiling national (country) inventories under the Kyoto Protocol,but these are usually compiled via a top-down exerciseusing national economic data, rather than aggregationof bottom-up company data. Compliance regimes aremore likely to focus on the “point of release” of emis-sions (i.e., direct emissions) and/or indirect emissionsfrom use of electricity. For GHG risk management andvoluntary reporting, double counting is less important. The World Resources Institute has a long-standing commitment toreduce its annual GHG emissions to net zero through a combinationof internal reduction efforts and external offset purchases. WRI’semissions inventory includes scope 2 indirect emissions associ-ated with the consumption of purchased electricity and scope 3indirect emissions associated with business air travel, employeecommuting, and paper use. WRI has no scope 1 direct emissions. Collecting employee commuting activity data from WRI’s 140 staff can be challenging. The method used is to survey employees onceeach year about their average commuting habits. In the first twoyears of the initiative, WRI used an Excel spreadsheet accessible to all employees on a shared internal network, but only achieved a 48 percent participation rate. A simplified, web-based survey that downloaded into a spreadsheet improved participation to 65 percent in the third year. Using feedback on the survey design,WRI further simplified and refined survey questions, improved userfriendliness, and reduced the time needed to complete the survey toless than a minute. Employee participation rate rose to 88 percent. Designing a survey that was easily navigable and had clearly artic- ulated questions significantly improved the completeness andaccuracy of the employee commuting activity data. An addedbenefit was that employees felt a certain amount of pride at having contributed to the inventory development process. The experiencealso provided a positive internal communications opportunity. WRI has developed a guide consistent with GHG Protocol Corporate Standard to help office-based organizations understand how to track and manage their emissions. Working 9 to 5 on Climate Change: An Office Guide is accompanied by a suite of calculation tools, including one for using a survey method to estimate employeecommuting emissions. The Guide and tools can be downloaded fromthe GHG Protocol Initiative website (www.ghgprotocol.org). Transportation-related emissions are the fastest growing GHG emissions category in the United States. This includes commercial,business, and personal travel as well as commuting. By accountingfor commuting emissions, companies may find that several practical opportunities exist for reducing them. For example, whenWRI moved to new office space, it selected a building located closeto public transportation, reducing the need for employees to drive to work. In its lease, WRI also negotiated access to a locked bikeroom for those employees who cycle to work. Finally, teleworkprograms significantly reduce commuting emissions by avoiding ordecreasing the need to travel. World Resources Institute: Innovations in estimating employee commuting emissions

For participating in GHG markets or obtaining GHG credits, it would be unacceptable for two organizationsto claim ownership of the same emissions commodityand it is therefore necessary to make sufficientprovisions to ensure that this does not occur betweenparticipating companies (see chapter 11). SCOPES AND DOUBLE COUNTING The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard is designed to prevent double counting of emissions between differentcompanies within scope 1 and 2. For example, thescope 1 emissions of company A (generator of electricity) can be counted as the scope 2 emissions ofcompany B (end-user of electricity) but company A’sscope 1 emissions cannot be counted as scope 1 emis-sions by company C (a partner organization ofcompany A) as long as company A and company Cconsistently apply the same control or equity shareapproach when consolidating emissions. Similarly, the definition of scope 2 does not allow double counting of emissions within scope 2, i.e., two differentcompanies cannot both count scope 2 emissions fromthe purchase of the same electricity. Avoiding this typeof double counting within scope 2 emissions makes it auseful accounting category for GHG trading programsthat regulate end users of electricity. When used in external initiatives such as GHG trading, the robustness of the scope 1 and 2 definitions combinedwith the consistent application of either the control orequity share approach for defining organizational bound-aries allows only one company to exercise ownership ofscope 1 or scope 2 emissions.CHAPTER 4 Setting Operational Boundaries 33 ABB, an energy and automation technology company based inSwitzerland, produces a variety of appliances and equipment,such as circuit breakers and electrical drives, for industrial appli-cations. ABB has a stated goal to issue Environmental ProductDeclarations (EPDs) for all its core products based on life cycleassessment. As a part of its committment, ABB reports bothmanufacturing and product use phase GHG emissions for avariety of its products using a standardized calculation methodand set of assumptions. For example, product use phase calcula-tions for ABB’s 4 kW DriveIT Low Voltage AC drive are based on a15-year expected lifetime and an average of 5,000 annual oper-ating hours. This activity data is multiplied by the averageelectricity emission factor for OECD countries to produce totallifetime product use emissions. Compared with manufacturing emissions, product use phase emissions account for about 99 percent of total life cycle emis-sions for this type of drive. The magnitude of these emissions andABB’s control of the design and performance of this equipmentclearly give the company significant leverage on its customers’emissions by improving product efficiency or helping customersdesign better overall systems in which ABB’s products areinvolved. By clearly defining and quantifying significant valuechain emissions, ABB has gained insight into and influence overits emissions footprint.ABB: Calculating product use phase emissions associated with electrical appliances NOTES 1The terms “direct” and “indirect” as used in this document should notbe confused with their use in national GHG inventories where ‘direct’refers to the six Kyoto gases and ‘indirect’ refers to the precursors NOx,NMVOC, and CO. 2The term “electricity” is used in this chapter as shorthand for elec-tricity, steam, and heating/cooling. 3For some integrated manufacturing processes, such as ammonia manu-facture, it may not be possible to distinguish between GHG emissions fromthe process and those from the production of electricity, heat, or steam. 4Green power includes renewable energy sources and specific clean energytechnologies that reduce GHG emissions relative to other sources of energythat supply the electric grid, e.g., solar photovoltaic panels, geothermalenergy, landfill gas, and wind turbines. 5A T&D system includes T&D lines and other T&D equipment (e.g., transformers). 6“Purchased materials and fuels” is defined as material or fuel that is purchased or otherwise brought into the organizational boundary of the company.

34 ompanies often undergo significant structural changes such as acquisitions, divestments, and mergers. These changes will alter a company’s historical emission profile, making meaningful comparisons overtime difficult. In order to maintain consistency over time, or in other words,to keep comparing “like with like”, historic emission data will have to be recalculated. CTracking Emissions Over Time GUIDANCESTANDARD5 STANDARD

Companies may need to track emissions over time in response to a variety of business goals, including: Public reporting Establishing GHG targets Managing risks and opportunities Addressing the needs of investors and other stakeholders A meaningful and consistent comparison of emissions over time requires that companies set a performancedatum with which to compare current emissions. Thisperformance datum is referred to as the base year 1 emissions. For consistent tracking of emissions overtime, the base year emissions may need to be recalcu-lated as companies undergo significant structuralchanges such as acquisitions, divestments, and mergers. The first step in tracking emissions, however, is the selec- tion of a base year. Choosing a base year Companies shall choose and report a base year for whichverifiable emissions data are available and specify theirreasons for choosing that particular year. Most companies select a single year as their base year. However, it is also possible to choose an average ofannual emissions over several consecutive years. Forexample, the U.K. ETS specifies an average of 1998–2000 emissions as the reference point for trackingreductions. A multi-year average may help smooth outunusual fluctuations in GHG emissions that would makea single year’s data unrepresentative of the company’stypical emissions profile. The inventory base year can also be used as a basis for setting and tracking progress towards a GHG target inwhich case it is referred to as a target base year (seechapter 11).Recalculating base year emissions Companies shall develop a base year emissions recalcu-lation policy, and clearly articulate the basis andcontext for any recalculations. If applicable, the policyshall state any “significance threshold” applied fordeciding on historic emissions recalculation. “Significancethreshold” is a qualitative and/or quantitative criterionused to define any significant change to the data, inven-tory boundary, methods, or any other relevant factors.It is the responsibility of the company to determine the “significance threshold” that triggers base yearemissions recalculation and to disclose it. It is theresponsibility of the verifier to confirm the company’sadherence to its threshold policy. The following casesshall trigger recalculation of base year emissions: Structural changes in the reporting organization that have a significant impact on the company’s base yearemissions. A structural change involves the transferof ownership or control of emissions-generating activ-ities or operations from one company to another.While a single structural change might not have asignificant impact on the base year emissions, thecumulative effect of a number of minor structuralchanges can result in a significant impact. Structuralchanges include: Mergers, acquisitions, and divestments Outsourcing and insourcing of emitting activities Changes in calculation methodology or improvements in the accuracy of emission factors or activity datathat result in a significant impact on the base yearemissions data Discovery of significant errors, or a number of cumu- lative errors, that are collectively significant. In summary, base year emissions shall be retroactively recalculated to reflect changes in the company thatwould otherwise compromise the consistency and rele-vance of the reported GHG emissions information. Oncea company has determined its policy on how it will recal-culate base year emissions, it shall apply this policy in aconsistent manner. For example, it shall recalculate forboth GHG emissions increases and decreases. CHAPTER 5 Tracking Emissions Over Time 35STANDARD

election and recalculation of a base year should relate to the business goals and the particularcontext of the company: For the purpose of reporting progress towards volun- tary public GHG targets, companies may follow thestandards and guidance in this chapter A company subject to an external GHG program may face external rules governing the choice and recalcu-lation of base year emissions For internal management goals, the company may follow the rules and guidelines recommended in thisdocument, or it may develop its own approach, whichshould be followed consistently.Choosing a base year Companies should choose as a base year the earliest rele-vant point in time for which they have reliable data.Some organizations have adopted 1990 as a base year inorder to be consistent with the Kyoto Protocol. However,obtaining reliable and verifiable data for historical baseyears such as 1990 can be very challenging. If a company continues to grow through acquisitions, it may adopt a policy that shifts or “rolls” the base yearforward by a number of years at regular intervals.Chapter 11 contains a description of such a “rollingbase year,” including a comparison with the fixed baseyear approach described in this chapter. A fixed baseyear has the advantage of allowing emissions data to becompared on a like-with-like basis over a longer timeperiod than a rolling base year approach. Most emis-sions trading and registry programs require a fixed baseyear policy to be implemented.GUIDANCETracking Emissions Over Time 36FIGURE 6. Base year emissions recalculation for an acquisition Base Year Increase in ProductionGamma Acquires C123 Company Gamma consists of two business units (A and B). In its base year (year one), each business unit emits 25 tonnes CO2. In year two, the company undergoes “organic growth,” leading to an increase in emissions to 30 tonnes CO2per business unit, i.e., 60 tonnes CO2in total. The base year emissions are not recalculated in this case. At the beginning of year three, the company acquires producti on facility C from another company. The annual emissions of facility C in year one were 15 tonnes CO2, and 20 tonnes CO2in years two and three. The total emission of company Gamma in year three, including facility C, are therefore 80 tonnes CO2. To maintain consistency over time, the company recalculates its base year emissions to take into account the acquisition of facility C. The base year emissions increa se by 15 tonnes CO2—the quantity of emissions produced by facility C in Gamma’s base year. The recalculated base year emissions are 65 tonnes CO2. Gamma also (optionally) reports 80 tonnes CO2as the recalculated emissions for year two. ➡ 25 2530 30302020 2015 30251520 20 2530 3030 30Figures reported in respective yearsGAMMA EMISSIONSRecalculated Figures Facility C Unit BUnit A 123 CHAPTER 5S Facility C emissions

Significance thresholds for recalculations Whether base year emissions are recalculated depends on the significance of the changes. The determination ofa significant change may require taking into account thecumulative effect on base year emissions of a number of small acquisitions or divestments. The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard makes no specific recommenda- tions as to what constitutes “significant.” However, some GHG programs do specify numerical significancethresholds, e.g., the California Climate ActionRegistry, where the change threshold is 10 percent ofthe base year emissions, determined on a cumulativebasis from the time the base year is established. Base year emissions recalculation for structural changes Structural changes trigger recalculation because they merely transfer emissions from one company to anotherwithout any change of emissions released to the atmos-phere, for example, an acquisition or divestment only transfers existing GHG emissions from one company’sinventory to another. Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the effect of structural changes and the application of this standard on recalcu-lation of base year emissions. Timing of recalculations for structural changes When significant structural changes occur during themiddle of the year, the base year emissions should berecalculated for the entire year, rather than only for theremainder of the reporting period after the structuralchange occurred. This avoids having to recalculate baseyear emissions again in the succeeding year. Similarly,current year emissions should be recalculated for theentire year to maintain consistency with the base yearrecalculation. If it is not possible to make a recalcula-tion in the year of the structural change (e.g., due toCHAPTER 5 Tracking Emissions Over Time 37GUIDANCEFIGURE 7.

Each business unit emits 25 tonnes CO2and the total emissions for the company are 75 tonnes CO2in the base year (year one). In year two, the output of the company grows, leading to an increase in emissions to 30 tonnes CO2per business unit, i.e., 90 tonnes CO2in total. At the beginning of year three, Beta divests business unit C and its annual emissions are now 60 tonnes, representing an apparent reduction of 15 tonnes relative to the base year emissions. However, to m aintain consistency over time, the company recalculates its base year emissions to take into account the divestment of business unit C. The base year emissions are lowered by 25 tonnes CO2—the quantity of emissions produced by the business unit C in the base year. The recalcu- lated base year emissions are 50 tonnes CO2, and the emissions of company Beta are seen to have risen by 10 tonnes CO2over the three years.

lack of data for an acquired company), the recalculation may be carried out in the following year.2 Recalculations for changes in calculation methodology or improvements in data accuracy A company might report the same sources of GHG emis- sions as in previous years, but measure or calculatethem differently. For example, a company might haveused a national electric power generation emissionsfactor to estimate scope 2 emissions in year one ofreporting. In later years, it may obtain more accurateutility-specific emission factors (for the current as wellas past years) that better reflect the GHG emissionsassociated with the electricity that it has purchased. If the differences in emissions resulting from such achange are significant, historic data is recalculatedapplying the new data and/or methodology. Sometimes the more accurate data input may not reason- ably be applied to all past years or new data points maynot be available for past years. The company may thenhave to backcast these data points, or the change in datasource may simply be acknowledged without recalcula-tion. This acknowledgement should be made in the reporteach year in order to enhance transparency; otherwise,new users of the report in the two or three years after thechange may make incorrect assumptions about theperformance of the company. Any changes in emission factor or activity data that reflect real changes in emissions (i.e., changes in fueltype or technology) do not trigger a recalculation. Optional reporting for recalculations Optional information that companies may report onrecalculations includes: The recalculated GHG emissions data for all years between the base year and the reporting year All actual emissions as reported in respective years in the past, i.e., the figures that have not been recalcu-lated. Reporting the original figures in addition to therecalculated figures contributes to transparency sinceit illustrates the evolution of the company’s structureover time. No base year emissions recalculations for facilities that did not exist in the base year Base year emissions are not recalculated if the company makes an acquisition of (or insources) operations thatdid not exist in its base year. There may only be a recal-culation of historic data back to the year in which theacquired company came into existence. The same appliesto cases where the company makes a divestment of (oroutsources) operations that did not exist in the base year. Figure 8 illustrates a situation where no recalculation of base year emissions is required, since the acquiredfacility came into existence after the base year was set. No recalculation for “ outsourcing/insourcing” if reported under scope 2 and/or scope 3 Structural changes due to “outsourcing” or “insourcing” do not trigger base year emissions recalculation if thecompany is reporting its indirect emissions from relevantoutsourced or insourced activities. For example,outsourcing production of electricity, heat, or steamdoes not trigger base year emissions recalculation, sincethe GHG Protocol Corporate Standard requires scope 2 reporting. However, outsourcing/insourcing that shiftssignificant emissions between scope 1 and scope 3 whenscope 3 is not reported does trigger a base year emis-sions recalculation (e.g., when a company outsourcesthe transportation of products). In case a company decides to track emissions over time separately for different scopes, and has separate baseyears for each scope, base year emissions recalculationfor outsourcing or insourcing is made. GUIDANCETracking Emissions Over Time CHAPTER 5 38TheGHG Protocol Corporate Standard requires setting a base year for comparing emissions over time. To be able to compare over time, thebase year emissions must be recalculated if any structural changesoccur in the company. In a deal completed January 2002, theENDESA Group, a power generation company based in Spain, sold its87.5 percent holding in Viesgo, a part of its Spanish power genera-tion business, to ENEL, an Italian power company. To account for thisstructural change, historical emissions from the six power plantsincluded in the sale were no longer accounted for in the Endesa GHGinventory and therefore removed from its base year emissions. Thisrecalculation provides ENDESA with a complete and comparablepicture of its historical emissions. ENDESA: Recalculation of base year emissions because of structural changes

--- Page 41 of 116 ---

No recalculation for organic growth or decline Base year emissions and any historic data are not recalculated for organic growth or decline. Organic growth/decline refers to increases or decreases inproduction output, changes in product mix, and closuresand openings of operating units that are owned orcontrolled by the company. The rationale for this isthat organic growth or decline results in a change ofemissions to the atmosphere and therefore needs to becounted as an increase or decrease in the company’semissions profile over time.

In its base year (year one), the company emits 50 tonnes CO2.In year two, the company undergoes organic growth, leading to an increase in emissions to 30 tonnes CO2per business unit, i.e., 60 tonnes CO2in total. The base year emissions are not recalculated in this case. At the beginning of year three, Teta acquires a production facility C from another company. Facility C came into existence in year two, its emissions being 15 tonnes CO2in year two and 20 tonnes CO2in year three. The total emissions of company Teta in year three, including facility C, are therefore 80 tonnes CO2. In this acquisition case, the base year emissions of company Teta do not change because the acquired facility C did not exist in year one when the base year of Teta was set. The base year emissions of Teta therefore remain at 50 tonnes CO2. Teta (optionally) reports 75 tonnes as the recalculated figure for year two emissions. TETA EMISSIONSGUIDANCE NOTES 1Terminology on this topic can be confusing. Base year emissions should be differentiated from the term “baseline,” which is mostly used in thecontext of project-based accounting. The term base year focuses on acomparison of emissions over time, while a baseline is a hypotheticalscenario for what GHG emissions would have been in the absence of a GHG reduction project or activity. 2For more information on the timing of base year emissions recalcula-tions, see the guidance document “Base year recalculationmethodologies for structural changes” on the GHG Protocol website(www.ghgprotocol.org). 20

GUIDANCE 40 nce the inventory boundary has been established, companies generally calculate GHG emissions using the following steps: 1. Identify GHG emissions sources2. Select a GHG emissions calculation approach3. Collect activity data and choose emission factors4. Apply calculation tools5. Roll-up GHG emissions data to corporate level. This chapter describes these steps and the calculation tools developed by the GHG Protocol. The calculation tools are available on the GHG Protocol Initiative websiteat www.ghgprotocol.org.

To create an accurate account of their emissions, companies have found it useful to divide overall emis-sions into specific categories. This allows a companyto use specifically developed methodologies to accu-rately calculate the emissions from each sector andsource category. Identify GHG emissions sources The first of the five steps in identifying and calculating a company’s emissions as outlined in Figure 9 is to categorize the GHG sources within that company’sboundaries. GHG emissions typically occur from thefollowing source categories:  Stationary combustion: combustion of fuels in stationary equipment such as boilers, furnaces,burners, turbines, heaters, incinerators, engines,flares, etc.  Mobile combustion: combustion of fuels in trans- portation devices such as automobiles, trucks, buses,trains, airplanes, boats, ships, barges, vessels, etc.  Process emissions: emissions from physical or chem- ical processes such as CO2from the calcination step in cement manufacturing, CO2from catalytic cracking in petrochemical processing, PFC emissions fromaluminum smelting, etc.  Fugitive emissions: intentional and unintentional releases such as equipment leaks from joints, seals,packing, gaskets, as well as fugitive emissions fromcoal piles, wastewater treatment, pits, cooling towers,gas processing facilities, etc. Every business has processes, products, or services that generate direct and/or indirect emissions from one ormore of the above broad source categories. The GHG Protocol calculation tools are organized based on these categories. Appendix D provides an overview of directand indirect GHG emission sources organized by scopesand industry sectors that may be used as an initial guideto identify major GHG emission sources. IDENTIFY SCOPE 1 EMISSIONS As a first step, a company should undertake an exer-cise to identify its direct emission sources in each ofthe four source categories listed above. Process emis-sions are usually only relevant to certain industrysectors like oil and gas, aluminum, cement, etc.Manufacturing companies that generate process emis-sions and own or control a power production facility will likely have direct emissions from all the main sourcecategories. Office-based organizations may not have anydirect GHG emissions except in cases where they own oroperate a vehicle, combustion device, or refrigerationand air-conditioning equipment. Often companies aresurprised to realize that significant emissions comefrom sources that are not initially obvious (see UnitedTechnologies case study). IDENTIFY SCOPE 2 EMISSIONS The next step is to identify indirect emission sources fromthe consumption of purchased electricity, heat, or steam.Almost all businesses generate indirect emissions due to thepurchase of electricity for use in their processes or services. IDENTIFY SCOPE 3 EMISSIONS This optional step involves identification of other indirectemissions from a company’s upstream and downstreamactivities as well as emissions associated withoutsourced/contract manufacturing, leases, or franchisesnot included in scope 1 or scope 2. The inclusion of scope 3 emissions allows businesses to expand their inventory boundary along their value chainand to identify all relevant GHG emissions. This providesa broad overview of various business linkages andpossible opportunities for significant GHG emissionreductions that may exist upstream or downstream of acompany’s immediate operations (see chapter 4 for anoverview of activities that can generate GHG emissionsalong a company’s value chain).CHAPTER 6 Identifying and Calculating GHG Emissions 41GUIDANCEFIGURE 9.

Select a calculation approach Direct measurement of GHG emissions by monitoring concentration and flow rate is not common. More often,emissions may be calculated based on a mass balance orstoichiometric basis specific to a facility or process.However, the most common approach for calculatingGHG emissions is through the application of documentedemission factors. These factors are calculated ratiosrelating GHG emissions to a proxy measure of activity atan emissions source. The IPCC guidelines (IPCC, 1996)refer to a hierarchy of calculation approaches and tech-niques ranging from the application of generic emissionfactors to direct monitoring. In many cases, particularly when direct monitoring is either unavailable or prohibitively expensive, accurateemission data can be calculated from fuel use data. Evensmall users usually know both the amount of fuelconsumed and have access to data on the carbon contentof the fuel through default carbon content coefficients orthrough more accurate periodic fuel sampling.Companies should use the most accurate calculationapproach available to them and that is appropriate fortheir reporting context. Collect activity data and choose emission factors For most small to medium-sized companies and for many larger companies, scope 1 GHG emissions will be calcu-lated based on the purchased quantities of commercialfuels (such as natural gas and heating oil) usingpublished emission factors. Scope 2 GHG emissions willprimarily be calculated from metered electricityconsumption and supplier-specific, local grid, or otherpublished emission factors. Scope 3 GHG emissions willprimarily be calculated from activity data such as fueluse or passenger miles and published or third-partyemission factors. In most cases, if source- or facility-specific emission factors are available, they arepreferable to more generic or general emission factors. Industrial companies may be faced with a wider range of approaches and methodologies. They should seekguidance from the sector-specific guidelines on theGHG Protocol website (if available) or from theirindustry associations (e.g., International AluminumInstitute, International Iron and Steel Institute,American Petroleum Institute, WBCSD SustainableCement Initiative, International Petroleum IndustryEnvironmental Conservation Association). Apply calculation tools This section provides an overview of the GHG calcula-tion tools and guidance available on the GHG Protocol Initiative website (www.ghgprotocol.org). Use of these tools is encouraged as they have been peer reviewed by experts and industry leaders, are regularly updated,and are believed to be the best available. The tools,however, are optional. Companies may substitute theirown GHG calculation methods, provided they are more accurate than or are at least consistent with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards approaches. There are two main categories of calculation tools: Cross-sector tools that can be applied to different sectors. These include stationary combustion, mobilecombustion, HFC use in refrigeration and air condi-tioning, and measurement and estimation uncertainty.  Sector-specific tools that are designed to calculate emissions in specific sectors such as aluminum, ironand steel, cement, oil and gas, pulp and paper, office-based organizations.GUIDANCEIdentifying and Calculating GHG Emissions CHAPTER 6 42In 1996, United Technologies Corporation (UTC), a global aero-space and building systems technology corporation, appointed ateam to set boundaries for the company’s new Natural ResourceConservation, Energy and Water Use Reporting Program. The teamfocused on what sources of energy should be included in theprogram's annual report of energy consumption. The teamdecided jet fuel needed to be reported in the annual report; jet fuelwas used by a number of UTC divisions for engine and flight hard-ware testing and for test firing. Although the amount of jet fuelused in any given year was subject to wide variation due tochanging test schedules, the total amount consumed in anaverage year was believed to be large and potentially smallenough to be specifically excluded. However, jet fuel consumptionreports proved that initial belief incorrect. Jet fuel has accountedfor between 9 and 13 percent of the corporation's total annual useof energy since the program commenced. Had UTC not includedthe use of jet fuel in annual data collection efforts, a significantemissions source would have been overlooked.United Technologies Corporation: More than meets the eye

Most companies will need to use more than one calcu- lation tool to cover all their GHG emission sources. For example, to calculate GHG emissions from analuminum production facility, the company would usethe calculation tools for aluminum production,stationary combustion (for any consumption ofpurchased electricity, generation of energy on-site, etc),mobile combustion (for transportation of materials andproducts by train, vehicles employed on-site, employeebusiness travel, etc), and HFC use (for refrigeration,etc). See Table 3 for the full list of tools. STRUCTURE OF GHG PROTOCOL CALCULATION TOOLS Each of the cross-sector and sector-specific calculationtools on the website share a common format andinclude step-by-step guidance on measuring and calcu-lating emissions data. Each tool consists of a guidancesection and automated worksheets with explanations onhow to use them. The guidance for each calculation tool includes the following sections:  Overview: provides an overview of the purpose and content of the tool, the calculation method used in thetool, and a process description  Choosing activity data and emission factors: provides sector-specific good practice guidance and referencesfor default emission factors  Calculation methods: describes different calculation methods depending on the availability of site-specificactivity data and emission factors  Quality control: provides good practice guidance Internal reporting and documentation: provides guidance on internal documentation to support emissions calculations.CHAPTER 6 Identifying and Calculating GHG Emissions 43GUIDANCEChevronTexaco, a global energy company, has developed and imple-mented energy utilization and GHG estimation and reportingsoftware consistent with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard . This software is available free of charge and makes it easier, more accu-rate, and less costly to institute a corporate-wide GHG accountingand reporting system in the oil and gas sector. Called the SANGEA ™ Energy and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimating System, it iscurrently in use at all ChevronTexaco facilities worldwide, comprisingmore than 70 reporting entities. The system is an auditable, Excel-and-Visual-Basic-based tool for estimating GHG emissions and energy utilization. It streamlines corpo-rate-level data consolidation by allowing the inventory coordinator ateach facility to configure a spreadsheet, enter monthly data, and sendquarterly reports to a centralized database. In practice, the SANGEA ™system employs a variety of strategies to ensure consistent calculation methods and ease company-widestandardization: • Spreadsheet configuration and material input information for specific facilities can be carried over from year to year. Inventoryspecialists can easily modify configurations as a facility changes(due to new construction, retirement of units, etc.). • Updates are efficient. Methodologies for estimating emissions, emission factors, and calculation equations are stored centrally inthe software, easing updates when methodologies or default factors change. Updates to this central reference are automati-cally applied to the existing configuration and input data.Updates will mirror the timing and content of updates to theAmerican Petroleum Institute Compendium of GHG emission esti-mating methodologies. • The system is auditable. The software requires detailed audit trail information on data inputs and system users. There is docu-mented accountability of who made any change to the system. • Using one system saves money. Significant cost savings are achieved by using the same system in all facilities, as comparedto conventional, disparate systems. ChevronTexaco’s one-off investment in developing the SANGEA ™system has already shown results: A rough cost estimate for ChevronTexaco'sRichmond, California, refinery indicates savings of more than 70percent over a five-year period compared with the conventionalapproaches based on locally developed reporting systems. SANGEA ™is expected to reduce the long term expenses of maintaining a legacysystem and hiring independent consultants. Employing a combinationof the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard s and SANGEA ™calculation software to replace a diverse and confusing set of accounting andreporting templates yields significant efficiency and accuracy gains,and allows the company to more accurately manage GHG emissionsand institute specific emissions improvements.ChevronTexaco: The SANGEATMaccounting and reporting system

In the automated worksheet section, it is only necessary to insert activity data into the worksheets and to selectan appropriate emission factor or factors. Default emis-sion factors are provided for the sectors covered, but it isalso possible to insert customized emission factors thatare more representative of the reporting company’s oper-ations. The emissions of each GHG (CO 2, CH4, N2O, etc.) are calculated separately and then converted to CO2 equivalents on the basis of their global warming potential. Some tools, such as the iron and steel sector tool and the HFC cross-sector tool, take a tiered approach, offering achoice between a simple and a more advanced calculationmethodology. The more advanced methods are expectedto produce more accurate emissions estimates but usuallyrequire collection of more detailed data and a morethorough understanding of a company’s technologies. Roll-up GHG emissions data to corporate level To report a corporation’s total GHG emissions, compa-nies will usually need to gather and summarize datafrom multiple facilities, possibly in different countriesand business divisions. It is important to plan thisprocess carefully to minimize the reporting burden,reduce the risk of errors that might occur whilecompiling data, and ensure that all facilities arecollecting information on an approved, consistent basis.Ideally, corporations will integrate GHG reporting withtheir existing reporting tools and processes, and takeadvantage of any relevant data already collected andreported by facilities to division or corporate offices,regulators or other stakeholders. The tools and processes chosen to report data will depend upon the information and communication infra-structure already in place (i.e., how easy is it to includenew data categories in corporate databases). It will alsodepend upon the amount of detail that corporate head-quarters wishes to be reported from facilities. Datacollection and management tools could include: Secure databases available over the company intranet or internet, for direct data entry by facilities Spreadsheet templates filled out and e-mailed to a corpo- rate or division office, where data is processed further Paper reporting forms faxed to a corporate or division office where data is re-entered in a corporate data-base. However, this method may increase thelikelihood of errors if there are not sufficient checks inplace to ensure the accurate transfer of the data.For internal reporting up to the corporate level, it is recommended that standardized reporting formats be used to ensure that data received from differentbusiness units and facilities is comparable, and thatinternal reporting rules are observed (see BP casestudy). Standardized formats can significantly reducethe risk of errors.CHAPTER 6 Identifying and Calculating GHG Emissions 45GUIDANCEBP, a global energy company, has been collecting GHG data fromthe different parts of its operations since 1997 and has consoli-dated its internal reporting processes into one central databasesystem. The responsibility for reporting environmental emissionslies with about 320 individual BP facilities and business depart-ments, which are termed “reporting units.” All reporting units haveto complete a standard Excel pro-forma spreadsheet every quarter,stating actual emissions for the preceding three months andupdates to forecasts for the current year and the next two years. Inaddition, reporting units are asked to account for all significantvariances, including sustainable reductions. The reporting units alluse the same BP GHG Reporting Guidelines “Protocol” (BP, 2000)for quantifying their emissions of carbon dioxide and methane. All pro-forma spreadsheets are e-mailed automatically by the central database to the reporting units, and the completed e-mailreturns are uploaded into the database by a corporate team, whocheck the quality of the incoming data. The data are then compiled,by the end of the month following each quarter end, to provide thetotal emission inventory and forecasts for analysis against BP’sGHG target. Finally, the inventory is reviewed by a team of inde-pendent external auditors to provide assurance on the quality andaccuracy of the data.BP: A standardized system for internal reporting of GHGs

Approaches for rolling up GHG emissions data to corporate level There are two basic approaches for gathering data on GHG emissions from a corporation’s facilities (Figure 10): Centralized: individual facilities report activity/fuel use data (such as quantity of fuel used) to the corpo-rate level, where GHG emissions are calculated.  Decentralized: individual facilities collect activity/fuel use data, directly calculate their GHG emissionsusing approved methods, and report this data to thecorporate level. The difference between these two approaches is in where the emissions calculations occur (i.e., where activity datais multiplied by the appropriate emission factors) and inwhat type of quality management procedures must be putin place at each level of the corporation. Facility-levelstaff is generally responsible for initial data collectionunder both approaches. Under both approaches, staff at corporate and lower levels of consolidation should take care to identify andexclude any scope 2 or 3 emissions that are alsoaccounted for as scope 1 emissions by other facilities,business units, or companies included in the emissionsinventory consolidation. CENTRALIZED APPROACH: INDIVIDUAL FACILITIES REPORT ACTIVITY/FUEL USE DATA This approach may be particularly suitable for office- based organizations. Requesting that facilities reporttheir activity/fuel use data may be the preferred option if: The staff at the corporate or division level can calcu- late emissions data in a straightforward manner onthe basis of activity/fuel use data; and Emissions calculations are standard across a number of facilities.DECENTRALIZED APPROACH: INDIVIDUAL FACILITIES CALCULATE GHG EMISSIONS DATA Asking facilities to calculate GHG emissions themselves will help to increase their awareness and understandingof the issue. However, it may also lead to resistance,increased training needs, an increase in calculationerrors, and a greater need for auditing of calculations.Requesting that facilities calculate GHG emissionsthemselves may be the preferred option if: GHG emission calculations require detailed knowledge of the kind of equipment being used at facilities; GHG emission calculation methods vary across a number of facilities; Process emissions (in contrast to emissions from burning fossil fuels) make up an important share oftotal GHG emissions; Resources are available to train facility staff to conduct these calculations and to audit them; A user-friendly tool is available to simplify the calcu- lation and reporting task for facility-level staff; or Local regulations require reporting of GHG emissions at a facility level. The choice of collection approach depends on the needs and characteristics of the reporting company. Forexample, United Technologies Corporation uses thecentralized approach, leaving the choice of emissionfactors and calculations to corporate staff, while BP usesthe decentralized approach and follows up with audits toensure calculations are correct, documented, and followapproved methods. To maximize accuracy and minimizereporting burdens, some companies use a combination ofthe two approaches. Complex facilities with processemissions calculate their emissions at the facility level,while facilities with uniform emissions from standardsources only report fuel use, electricity consumption, andtravel activity. The corporate database or reporting toolthen calculates total GHG emissions for each of thesestandard activities. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive and should produce the same result. Thus companiesdesiring a consistency check on facility-level calcula-tions can follow both approaches and compare theresults. Even when facilities calculate their own GHGemissions, corporate staff may still wish to gatheractivity/fuel use data to double-check calculations andexplore opportunities for emissions reductions.

CHAPTER 6 Identifying and Calculating GHG Emissions 47GUIDANCEdata should be available and transparent to staff at all corporate levels. Corporate staff should also verify thatfacility-reported data are based on well defined, consis-tent, and approved inventory boundaries, reportingperiods, calculation methodologies, etc. Common guidance on reporting to corporate level Reports from facility level to corporate or divisionoffices should include all relevant information as speci-fied in chapter 9. Some reporting categories arecommon to both the centralized and decentralizedapproaches and should be reported by facilities to theircorporate offices. These include: A brief description of the emission sources A list and justification of specific exclusion or inclu- sion of sources Comparative information from previous years The reporting period covered Any trends evident in the data Progress towards any business targets A discussion of uncertainties in activity/fuel use or emissions data reported, their likely cause, and recom-mendations for how data can be improved A description of events and changes that have an impact on reported data (acquisitions, divestitures, closures,technology upgrades, changes of reporting boundariesor calculation methodologies applied, etc.). REPORTING FOR THE CENTRALIZED APPROACH In addition to the activity/fuel use data and aforemen-tioned common categories of reporting data, facilitiesfollowing the centralized approach by reportingactivity/fuel use data to the corporate level should alsoreport the following: Activity data for freight and passenger transport activities (e.g., freight transport in tonne-kilometers) Activity data for process emissions (e.g., tonnes of fertilizer produced, tonnes of waste in landfills) Clear records of any calculations undertaken to derive activity/fuel use data Local emission factors necessary to translate fuel use and/or electricity consumption into CO 2emissions.REPORTING FOR THE DECENTRALIZED APPROACH In addition to the GHG emissions data and aforemen-tioned common categories of reporting data, individualfacilities following the decentralized approach byreporting calculated GHG emissions to the corporatelevel should also report the following: A description of GHG calculation methodologies and any changes made to those methodologies relative toprevious reporting periods Ratio indicators (see chapter 9) Details on any data references used for the calculations, in particular information on emission factors used. Clear records of calculations undertaken to derive emissions data should be kept for any future internal orexternal verification.

ompanies have different reasons for managing the quality of their GHG emissions inventory, ranging from identifying opportunities for improvement to stakeholder demand to preparation for regulation. The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard recognizes that these reasons are a function of a company’s goals and its expectations for the future. A company’s goals for andvision of the evolution of the GHG emissions issue should guide the design ofits corporate inventory, the implementation of a quality management system,and the treatment of uncertainty within its inventory. GUIDANCE 48C7Managing Inventory Quality GUIDANCE

--- Page 51 of 116 ---

A corporate GHG inventory program includes all institu- tional, managerial, and technical arrangements made forthe collection of data, preparation of the inventory, andimplementation of steps to manage the quality of theinventory. 1The guidance in this chapter is intended to help companies develop and implement a qualitymanagement system for their inventory. Given an uncertain future, high quality information will have greater value and more uses, while low qualityinformation may have little or no value or use and mayeven incur penalties. For example, a company maycurrently be focusing on a voluntary GHG program butalso want its inventory data to meet the anticipatedrequirements of a future when emissions may havemonetary value. A quality management system is essential to ensuring that an inventory continues to meet the principles of the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and anticipates the requirements of future GHG emissions programs. Even if a company is not anticipating a future regulatory mechanism, internal and external stakeholders willdemand high quality inventory information. Therefore,the implementation of some type of quality managementsystem is important. However, the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard recognizes that companies do not have unlim- ited resources, and, unlike financial accounting,corporate GHG inventories involve a level of scientificand engineering complexity. Therefore, companies shoulddevelop their inventory program and quality manage-ment system as a cumulative effort in keeping with theirresources, the broader evolution of policy, and their owncorporate vision. A quality management system provides a systematic process for preventing and correcting errors, and identifies areas where investments will likely lead tothe greatest improvement in overall inventory quality.However, the primary objective of quality management is ensuring the credibility of a company’s GHG inven-tory information. The first step towards achieving thisobjective is defining inventory quality.Defining inventory quality The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard outlines five accounting principles that set an implicit standard forthe faithful representation of a company’s GHG emissionthrough its technical, accounting, and reporting efforts(see chapter 1). Putting these principles into practicewill result in a credible and unbiased treatment and pres-entation of issues and data. For a company to followthese principles, quality management needs to be anintegral part of its corporate inventory program. Thegoal of a quality management system is to ensure thatthese principles are put into practice.CHAPTER 7 Managing Inventory Quality 49GUIDANCEKPMG, a global services company, found that a key factor in thederivation of reliable, verifiable GHG data is the integration ofGHG data management and reporting mechanisms with compa-nies’ core operational management and assurance processes.This is because: •It is more efficient to widen the scope of existing embedded management and assurance processes than to develop a separatefunction responsible for generating and reporting GHG information. •As GHG information becomes increasingly monetized, it will attract the same attention as other key performance indicatorsof businesses. Therefore, management will need to ensureadequate procedures are in place to report reliable data. Theseprocedures can most effectively be implemented by functionswithin the organization that oversee corporate governance,internal audit, IT, and company reporting. Another factor that is often not given sufficient emphasis is training of personnel and communication of GHG objectives. Datageneration and reporting systems are only as reliable as thepeople who operate them. Many well-designed systems failbecause the precise reporting needs of the company are notadequately explained to the people who have to interpret areporting standard and calculation tools. Given the complexity ofaccounting boundaries and an element of subjectivity that mustaccompany source inclusion and equity share, inconsistent inter-pretation of reporting requirements is a real risk. It is alsoimportant that those responsible for supplying input data areaware of its use. The only way to minimize this risk is throughclear communication, adequate training and knowledge sharing.KPMG: The value of integrating GHG management with existing systems

An inventory program framework A practical framework is needed to help companies conceptualize and design a quality management systemand to help plan for future improvements. This frame-work focuses on the following institutional, managerial,and technical components of an inventory (Figure 11): METHODS: These are the technical aspects of inventory preparation. Companies should select or develop method-ologies for estimating emissions that accurately representthe characteristics of their source categories. The GHG Protocol provides many default methods and calculation tools to help with this effort. The design of an inventoryprogram and quality management system should providefor the selection, application, and updating of inventorymethodologies as new research becomes available,changes are made to business operations, or the impor-tance of inventory reporting is elevated. DATA: This is the basic information on activity levels, emission factors, processes, and operations. Althoughmethodologies need to be appropriately rigorous anddetailed, data quality is more important. No method-ology can compensate for poor quality input data. Thedesign of a corporate inventory program should facilitatethe collection of high quality inventory data and themaintenance and improvement of collection procedures. INVENTORY PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS: These are the institutional, managerial, and technical procedures forpreparing GHG inventories. They include the team andprocesses charged with the goal of producing a highquality inventory. To streamline GHG inventory quality management, these processes and systems may be inte- grated, where appropriate, with other corporateprocesses related to quality. DOCUMENTATION: This is the record of methods, data, processes, systems, assumptions, and estimates used toprepare an inventory. It includes everything employeesneed to prepare and improve a company’s inventory.Since estimating GHG emissions is inherently technical(involving engineering and science), high quality, trans-parent documentation is particularly important tocredibility. If information is not credible, or fails to beeffectively communicated to either internal or externalstakeholders, it will not have value. Companies should seek to ensure the quality of these components at every level of their inventory design. Implementing an inventory quality management system A quality management system for a company’s inventory program should address all four of the inventory compo-nents described above. To implement the system, acompany should take the following steps: 1. Establish an inventory quality team. This team should be responsible for implementing a quality manage-ment system, and continually improving inventoryquality. The team or manager should coordinateinteractions between relevant business units, facilities and external entities such as governmentagency programs, research institutions, verifiers, orconsulting firms.

2. Develop a quality management plan. This plan describes the steps a company is taking to implementits quality management system, which should beincorporated into the design of its inventory programfrom the beginning, although further rigor andcoverage of certain procedures may be phased inover multiple years. The plan should include proce-dures for all organizational levels and inventorydevelopment processes—from initial data collectionto final reporting of accounts. For efficiency andcomprehensiveness, companies should integrate (andextend as appropriate) existing quality systems tocover GHG management and reporting, such as anyISO procedures. To ensure accuracy, the bulk of the plan should focus on practical measures for imple-menting the quality management system, asdescribed in steps three and four. 3. Perform generic quality checks. These apply to data and processes across the entire inventory, focusing onappropriately rigorous quality checks on data handling,documentation, and emission calculation activities(e.g., ensuring that correct unit conversions are used).Guidance on quality checking procedures is providedin the section on implementation below (see table 4).CHAPTER 7 Managing Inventory Quality 51GUIDANCETABLE 4.

4. Perform source-category-specific quality checks. This includes more rigorous investigations into the appro-priate application of boundaries, recalculationprocedures, and adherence to accounting andreporting principles for specific source categories, aswell as the quality of the data input used (e.g.,whether electricity bills or meter readings are the bestsource of consumption data) and a qualitative descrip-tion of the major causes of uncertainty in the data.The information from these investigations can also beused to support a quantitative assessment of uncer-tainty. Guidance on these investigations is provided inthe section on implementation below. 5. Review final inventory estimates and reports. After the inventory is completed, an internal technicalreview should focus on its engineering, scientific,and other technical aspects. Subsequently, aninternal managerial review should focus on securingofficial corporate approval of and support for theinventory. A third type of review involving expertsexternal to the company’s inventory program isaddressed in chapter 10. 6. Institutionalize formal feedback loops. The results of the reviews in step five, as well as the results of everyother component of a company’s quality managementsystem, should be fed back via formal feedback proce-dures to the person or team identified in step one.Errors should be corrected and improvements imple-mented based on this feedback. 7. Establish reporting, documentation, and archiving procedures. The system should contain record keeping procedures that specify what information will be docu-mented for internal purposes, how that informationshould be archived, and what information is to bereported for external stakeholders. Like internal andexternal reviews, these record keeping proceduresinclude formal feedback mechanisms. A company’s quality management system and overall inventory program should be treated as evolving, inkeeping with a company’s reasons for preparing aninventory. The plan should address the company’sstrategy for a multi-year implementation (i.e., recognizethat inventories are a long-term effort), including stepsto ensure that all quality control findings from previousyears are adequately addressed. Practical measures for implementation Although principles and broad program design guidelinesare important, any guidance on quality managementwould be incomplete without a discussion of practicalinventory quality measures. A company should imple-ment these measures at multiple levels within the company, from the point of primary data collection to the finalcorporate inventory approval process. It is important toimplement these measures at points in the inventoryprogram where errors are mostly likely to occur, such asthe initial data collection phase and during calculation anddata aggregation. While corporate level inventory qualitymay initially be emphasized, it is important to ensurequality measures are implemented at all levels of disaggre-gation (e.g., facility, process, geographical, according to aparticular scope, etc) to be better prepared for GHGmarkets or regulatory rules in the future. Companies also need to ensure the quality of their histor- ical emission estimates and trend data. They can achievethis by employing inventory quality measures to mini-mize biases that can arise from changes in thecharacteristics of the data or methods used to calculatehistorical emission estimates, and by following the stan-dards and guidance of chapter 5. The third step of a quality management system, as described above, is to implement generic qualitychecking measures. These measures apply to all sourcecategories and all levels of inventory preparation.Table 4 provides a sample list of such measures. The fourth step of a quality management system is source category-specific data quality investigations. Theinformation gathered from these investigations can alsobe used for the quantitative and qualitative assessmentof data uncertainty (see section on uncertainty).Addressed below are the types of source-specific qualitymeasures that can be employed for emission factors,activity data, and emission estimates.GUIDANCEManaging Inventory Quality CHAPTER 7 52

EMISSION FACTORS AND OTHER PARAMETERS For a particular source category, emissions calculations will generally rely on emission factors and other parame-ters (e.g., utilization factors, oxidation rates, methaneconversion factors). 2These factors and parameters may be published or default factors, based on company-specific data, site-specific data, or direct emission orother measurements. For fuel consumption, publishedemission factors based on fuel energy content are gener-ally more accurate than those based on mass or volume,except when mass or volume based factors have beenmeasured at the company- or site-specific level. Qualityinvestigations need to assess the representativeness andapplicability of emission factors and other parameters tothe specific characteristics of a company. Differencesbetween measured and default values need to be qualita-tively explained and justified based upon the company’soperational characteristics. ACTIVITY DATA The collection of high quality activity data will often bethe most significant limitation for corporate GHG inven-tories. Therefore, establishing robust data collectionprocedures needs to be a priority in the design of anycompany’s inventory program. The following are usefulmeasures for ensuring the quality of activity data: Develop data collection procedures that allow the same data to be efficiently collected in future years. Convert fuel consumption data to energy units before applying carbon content emission factors, which may bebetter correlated to a fuel’s energy content than its mass. Compare current year data with historical trends. If data do not exhibit relatively consistent changes fromyear to year then the causes for these patterns shouldbe investigated (e.g., changes of over 10 percent fromyear to year may warrant further investigation). Compare activity data from multiple reference sources (e.g., government survey data or data compiled bytrade associations) with corporate data when possible.Such checks can ensure that consistent data is beingreported to all parties. Data can also be comparedamong facilities within a company.Investigate activity data that is generated for purposes other than preparing a GHG inventory. In doing so,companies will need to check the applicability of thisdata to inventory purposes, including completeness,consistency with the source category definition, andconsistency with the emission factors used. Forexample, data from different facilities may be exam-ined for inconsistent measurement techniques,operating conditions, or technologies. Quality controlmeasures (e.g., ISO) may have already been conductedduring the data’s original preparation. These measurescan be integrated with the company’s inventory qualitymanagement system. Check that base year recalculation procedures have been followed consistently and correctly (see chapter 5). Check that operational and organizational boundary decisions have been applied correctly and consistentlyto the collection of activity data (see chapters 3 and 4). CHAPTER 7 Managing Inventory Quality 53GUIDANCEInterface, Inc., is the world’s largest manufacturer of carpet tilesand upholstery fabrics for commercial interiors. The company hasestablished an environmental data system that mirrors its corpo-rate financial data reporting. The Interface EcoMetrics system isdesigned to provide activity and material flow data from businessunits in a number of countries (the United States, Canada,Australia, the United Kingdom, Thailand and throughout Europe)and provides metrics for measuring progress on environmentalissues such as GHG emissions. Using company-wide accountingguidelines and standards, energy and material input data arereported to a central database each quarter and made availableto sustainability personnel. These data are the foundation ofInterface’s annual inventory and enable data comparison overtime in the pursuit of improved quality. Basing emissions data systems on financial reporting helps Interface improve its data quality. Just as financial data need tobe documented and defensible, Interface’s emissions data areheld to standards that promote an increasingly transparent,accurate, and high-quality inventory. Integrating its financial andemissions data systems has made Interface’s GHG accountingand reporting more useful as it strives to be a “completelysustainable company” by 2020.Interface: Integration of emissions and business data systems

Investigate whether biases or other characteristics that could affect data quality have been previously identi-fied (e.g., by communicating with experts at aparticular facility or elsewhere). For example, a biascould be the unintentional exclusion of operations atsmaller facilities or data that do not correspondexactly with the company’s organizational boundaries. Extend quality management measures to cover any additional data (sales, production, etc.) used to esti-mate emission intensities or other ratios. EMISSION ESTIMATES Estimated emissions for a source category can becompared with historical data or other estimates toensure they fall within a reasonable range. Potentiallyunreasonable estimates provide cause for checkingemission factors or activity data and determiningwhether changes in methodology, market forces, orother events are sufficient reasons for the change. Insituations where actual emission monitoring occurs(e.g., power plant CO 2emissions), the data from moni- tors can be compared with calculated emissions usingactivity data and emission factors. If any of the above emission factor, activity data, emis- sion estimate, or other parameter checks indicate aproblem, more detailed investigations into the accuracyof the data or appropriateness of the methods may berequired. These more detailed investigations can also be utilized to better assess the quality of data. Onepotential measure of data quality is a quantitative andqualitative assessment of their uncertainty.Inventory quality and inventory uncertainty Preparing a GHG inventory is inherently both anaccounting and a scientific exercise. Most applicationsfor company-level emissions and removal estimatesrequire that these data be reported in a format similar tofinancial accounting data. In financial accounting, it isstandard practice to report individual point estimates(i.e., single value versus a range of possible values). Incontrast, the standard practice for most scientific studiesof GHG and other emissions is to report quantitativedata with estimated error bounds (i.e., uncertainty). Justlike financial figures in a profit and loss or bank accountstatement, point estimates in a corporate emission inven-tory have obvious uses. However, how would or shouldthe addition of some quantitative measure of uncertaintyto an emission inventory be used? In an ideal situation, in which a company had perfect quantitative information on the uncertainty of its emis-sion estimates at all levels, the primary use of thisinformation would almost certainly be comparative.Such comparisons might be made across companies,across business units, across source categories, orthrough time. In this situation, inventory estimates couldeven be rated or discounted based on their qualitybefore they were used, with uncertainty being the objec-tive quantitative metric for quality. Unfortunately, suchobjective uncertainty estimates rarely exist. TYPES OF UNCERTAINTIES Uncertainties associated with GHG inventories can be broadly categorized into scientific uncertainty and estimation uncertainty .Scientific uncertainty arises when the science of the actual emission and/or removalprocess is not completely understood. For example, many direct and indirect factors associated with globalwarming potential (GWP) values that are used tocombine emission estimates for various GHGs involvesignificant scientific uncertainty. Analyzing and quanti-fying such scientific uncertainty is extremely problematicand is likely to be beyond the capacity of most companyinventory programs.GUIDANCEManaging Inventory Quality CHAPTER 7 54The experience of the U.K. automotive manufacturer VauxhalMotors illustrates the importance of attention to detail insetting up GHG information collection systems. The companywished to calculate GHG emissions from staff air travel.However, when determining the impact of flight travel, it isimportant to make sure that the round trip distance is usedwhen calculating emissions. Fortunately, Vauxhall’s review ofits assumptions and calculation methodologies revealed thisfact and avoided reporting emissions that were 50 percentlower than the actual value.Vauxhall Motors: The importance of accuracy checks

--- Page 57 of 116 ---

Estimation uncertainty arises any time GHG emissions are quantified. Therefore all emissions or removal esti-mates are associated with estimation uncertainty.Estimation uncertainty can be further classified into twotypes: model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty.3 Model uncertainty refers to the uncertainty associated with the mathematical equations (i.e., models) used tocharacterize the relationships between various parame-ters and emission processes. For example, modeluncertainty may arise either due to the use of an incor-rect mathematical model or inappropriate input intothe model. As with scientific uncertainty, estimatingmodel uncertainty is likely to be beyond mostcompany’s inventory efforts; however, some companiesmay wish to utilize their unique scientific and engi-neering expertise to evaluate the uncertainty in theiremission estimation models. Parameter uncertainty refers to the uncertainty associ- ated with quantifying the parameters used as inputs(e.g., activity data and emission factors) into estima-tion models. Parameter uncertainties can be evaluatedthrough statistical analysis, measurement equipmentprecision determinations, and expert judgment.Quantifying parameter uncertainties and then esti-mating source category uncertainties based on theseparameter uncertainties will be the primary focus ofcompanies that choose to investigate the uncertainty intheir emission inventories. LIMITATIONS OF UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATES Given that only parameter uncertainties are within thefeasible scope of most companies, uncertainty estimatesfor corporate GHG inventories will, of necessity, beimperfect. Complete and robust sample data will notalways be available to assess the statistical uncertainty 4 in every parameter. For most parameters (e.g., liters ofgasoline purchased or tonnes of limestone consumed),only a single data point may be available. In somecases, companies can utilize instrument precision orcalibration information to inform their assessment ofstatistical uncertainty. However, to quantify some of thesystematic uncertainties 5associated with parameters and to supplement statistical uncertainty estimates, companies will usually have to rely on expert judgment.6The problem with expert judgment, though, is that it is difficult to obtain in acomparable (i.e., unbiased) and consistent manneracross parameters, source categories, or companies. CHAPTER 7 Managing Inventory Quality 55GUIDANCE

--- Page 58 of 116 ---

For these reasons, almost all comprehensive estimates of uncertainty for GHG inventories will be not only imper-fect but also have a subjective component and, despite the most thorough efforts, are themselves consideredhighly uncertain. In most cases, uncertainty estimatescannot be interpreted as an objective measure of quality.Nor can they be used to compare the quality of emissionestimates between source categories or companies. Exceptions to this include the following cases in which it is assumed that either statistical or instrument precisiondata are available to objectively estimate each para-meter’s statistical uncertainty (i.e., expert judgment isnot needed): When two operationally similar facilities use identical emission estimation methodologies, the differences inscientific or model uncertainties can, for the mostpart, be ignored. Then quantified estimates of statis-tical uncertainty can be treated as being comparablebetween facilities. This type of comparability is what isaimed for in some trading programs that prescribespecific monitoring, estimation, and measurementrequirements. However, even in this situation, thedegree of comparability depends on the flexibility thatparticipants are given for estimating emissions, thehomogeneity across facilities, as well as the level ofenforcement and review of the methodologies used. Similarly, when a single facility uses the same estima- tion methodology each year, the systematic parameteruncertainties—in addition to scientific and modeluncertainties—in a source’s emission estimates fortwo years are, for the most part, identical. 7Because the systematic parameter uncertainties then cancelout, the uncertainty in an emission trend (e.g., thedifference between the estimates for two years) isgenerally less than the uncertainty in total emissionsfor a single year. In such a situation, quantified uncer-tainty estimates can be treated as being comparableover time and used to track relative changes in thequality of a facility’s emission estimates for thatsource category. Such estimates of uncertainty inemission trends can also be used as a guide to settinga facility’s emissions reduction target. Trend uncer-tainty estimates are likely to be less useful for settingbroader (e.g., company-wide) targets (see chapter 11)because of the general problems with comparabilitybetween uncertainty estimates across gases, sources,and facilities.Given these limitations, the role of qualitative and quan- titative uncertainty assessments in developing GHGinventories include: Promoting a broader learning and quality feedback process. Supporting efforts to qualitatively understand and document the causes of uncertainty and help identifyways of improving inventory quality. For example,collecting the information needed to determine thestatistical properties of activity data and emissionfactors forces one to ask hard questions and to care-fully and systematically investigate data quality. Establishing lines of communication and feedback with data suppliers to identify specific opportunities to improve quality of the data and methods used. Providing valuable information to reviewers, verifiers, and managers for setting priorities for investmentsinto improving data sources and methodologies. The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard has developed a supplementary guidance document on uncertainty assess-ments (“Guidance on uncertainty assessment in GHGinventories and calculating statistical parameter uncer-tainty”) along with an uncertainty calculation tool, bothof which are available on the GHG Protocol website. Theguidance document describes how to use the calculationtool in aggregating uncertainties. It also discusses inmore depth different types of uncertainties, the limita-tions of quantitative uncertainty assessment, and howuncertainty estimates should be properly interpreted. Additional guidance and information on assessing uncertainty—including optional approaches to devel-oping quantitative uncertainty estimates and eliciting judgments from experts— can also be found in EPA'sEmissions Inventory Improvement Program, Volume VI:Quality Assurance/Quality Control (1999) and in chapter 6 of the IPCC’s Good Practice Guidance (2000a).GUIDANCEManaging Inventory Quality CHAPTER 7 56

CHAPTER 7 Managing Inventory Quality 57GUIDANCE NOTES 1Although the term “emissions inventory” is used throughout this chapter, the guidance equally applies to estimates of removals due to sink cate-gories (e.g., forest carbon sequestration). 2Some emission estimates may be derived using mass or energybalances, engineering calculations, or computer simulation models. Inaddition to investigating the input data to these models, companiesshould also consider whether the internal assumptions (includingassumed parameters in the model) are appropriate to the nature of thecompany’s operations. 3Emissions estimated from direct emissions monitoring will generally onlyinvolve parameter uncertainty (e.g., equipment measurement error). 4Statistical uncertainty results from natural variations (e.g., randomhuman errors in the measurement process and fluctuations in measure-ment equipment). Statistical uncertainty can be detected throughrepeated experiments or sampling of data.5Systematic parameter uncertainty occurs if data are systematicallybiased. In other words, the average of the measured or estimated value isalways less or greater than the true value. Biases arise, for example,because emission factors are constructed from non-representativesamples, all relevant source activities or categories have not been identi-fied, or incorrect or incomplete estimation methods or faulty measurementequipment have been used. Because the true value is unknown, suchsystematic biases cannot be detected through repeated experiments and,therefore, cannot be quantified through statistical analysis. However, it ispossible to identify biases and, sometimes, to quantify them through dataquality investigations and expert judgments. 6The role of expert judgment can be twofold: First, it can provide the datanecessary to estimate the parameter. Second, it can help (in combinationwith data quality investigations) identify, explain, and quantify bothstatistical and systematic uncertainties. 7It should be recognized, however, that biases may not be constant fromyear to year but instead may exhibit a pattern over time (e.g., may begrowing or falling). For example, a company that continues to disinvest incollecting high quality data may create a situation in which the biases inits data get worse each year. These types of data quality issues areextremely problematic because of the effect they can have on calculatedemission trends. In such cases, systematic parameter uncertaintiescannot be ignored.

GUIDANCE 58 s voluntary reporting, external GHG programs, and emission trading systems evolve, it is becoming more and more essential for compa- nies to understand the implications of accounting for GHG emissions changesover time on the one hand, and, on the other hand, accounting for offsets orcredits that result from GHG reduction projects. This chapter elaborates on thedifferent issues associated with the term “GHG reductions.”A8Accounting for GHG Reductions GUIDANCE

--- Page 61 of 116 ---

The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard focuses on accounting and reporting for GHG emissions at thecompany or organizational level. Reductions in corpo-rate emissions are calculated by comparing changes in the company’s actual emissions inventory over timerelative to a base year. Focusing on overall corporateor organizational level emissions has the advantage ofhelping companies manage their aggregate GHG risksand opportunities more effectively. It also helps focusresources on activities that result in the most cost-effective GHG reductions. In contrast to corporate accounting, the forthcoming GHG Protocol Project Quantification Standard focuses on the quantification of GHG reductions from GHG miti-gation projects that will be used as offsets. Offsets arediscrete GHG reductions used to compensate for (i.e.,offset) GHG emissions elsewhere, for example to meeta voluntary or mandatory GHG target or cap. Offsetsare calculated relative to a baseline that represents a hypothetical scenario for what emissions would havebeen in the absence of the project. Corporate GHG reductions at facility or country level From the perspective of the earth's atmosphere, it does not matter where GHG emissions or reductions occur. Fromthe perspective of national and international policymakersaddressing global warming, the location where GHGreductions are achieved is relevant, since policies usuallyfocus on achieving reductions within specific countriesor regions, as spelled out, for example, in the KyotoProtocol. Thus companies with global operations willhave to respond to an array of state, national, or regionalregulations and requirements that address GHGs fromoperations or facilities within a specific geographic area. The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard calculates GHG emissions using a bottom-up approach. This involvescalculating emissions at the level of an individual sourceor facility and then rolling this up to the corporate level.Thus a company’s overall emissions may decrease, evenif increases occur at specific sources, facilities, or opera-tions and vice-versa. This bottom-up approach enablescompanies to report GHG emissions information atdifferent scales, e.g., by individual sources or facilities,or by a collection of facilities within a given country.Companies can meet an array of government require-ments or voluntary commitments by comparing actualemissions over time for the relevant scale. On a corpo-rate-wide scale, this information can also be used when setting and reporting progress towards a corporate-wideGHG target (see chapter 11). In order to track and explain changes in GHG emissions over time, companies may find it useful to provide information on the nature of these changes. Forexample, BP asks each of its reporting units to providesuch information in an accounting movement formatusing the following categories (BP 2000): Acquisitions and divestments Closure Real reductions (e.g., efficiency improvements, material or fuel substitution) Change in production level Changes in estimation methodology Other This type of information can be summarized at the corporate level to provide an overview of the company’sperformance over time. Reductions in indirect emissions Reductions in indirect emissions (changes in scope 2 or 3emissions over time) may not always capture the actualemissions reduction accurately. This is because there isnot always a direct cause-effect relationship between theactivity of the reporting company and the resulting GHGemissions. For example, a reduction in air travel wouldreduce a company’s scope 3 emissions. This reduction isusually quantified based on an average emission factorof fuel use per passenger. However, how this reductionactually translates into a change in GHG emissions tothe atmosphere would depend on a number of factors,including whether another person takes the “empty seat”or whether this unused seat contributes to reduced airtraffic over the longer term. Similarly, reductions in scope 2 emissions calculated with an average gridemissions factor may over- or underestimate the actualreduction depending on the nature of the grid. Generally, as long as the accounting of indirect emissions over time recognizes activities that in aggregate changeglobal emissions, any such concerns over accuracyshould not inhibit companies from reporting their indi-rect emissions. In cases where accuracy is moreimportant, it may be appropriate to undertake a moreCHAPTER 8 Accounting for GHG Reductions 59GUIDANCE

detailed assessment of the actual reduction using a project quantification methodology. Project based reductions and offsets/credits Project reductions that are to be used as offsets shouldbe quantified using a project quantification method, suchas the forthcoming GHG Protocol Project Quantification Standard, that addresses the following accounting issues:  SELECTION OF A BASELINE SCENARIO AND EMISSION. The baseline scenario represents what would have happened in the absence of the project. Baselineemissions are the hypothetical emissions associatedwith this scenario. The selection of a baselinescenario always involves uncertainty because itrepresents a hypothetical scenario for what wouldhave happened without the project. The projectreduction is calculated as the difference between the baseline and project emissions. This differs fromthe way corporate or organizational reductions aremeasured in this document, i.e., in relation to anactual historical base year.  DEMONSTRATION OF ADDITIONALITY. This relates to whether the project has resulted in emission reductionsor removals in addition to what would have happened inthe absence of the project. If the project reduction isused as an offset, the quantification procedure shouldaddress additionality and demonstrate that the projectitself is not the baseline and that project emissions areless than baseline emissions. Additionality ensures theintegrity of the fixed cap or target for which the offset isused. Each reduction unit from a project used as anoffset allows the organization or facility with a cap ortarget one additional unit of emissions. If the projectwere going to happen anyway (i.e., is non-additional),global emissions will be higher by the number of reduc-tion units issued to the project.  IDENTIFICATION AND QUANTIFICATION OF RELEVANT SECONDARY EFFECTS. These are GHG emissions changes resulting from the project not captured by theprimary effect(s). 1Secondary effects are typically the small, unintended GHG consequences of a project andinclude leakage (changes in the availability or quan-tity of a product or service that results in changes inGHG emissions elsewhere) as well as changes in GHGemissions up- and downstream of the project. If rele-vant, secondary effects should be incorporated intothe calculation of the project reduction.  CONSIDERATION OF REVERSIBILITY. Some projects achieve reductions in atmospheric carbon dioxidelevels by capturing, removing and/or storing carbonor GHGs in biological or non-biological sinks (e.g.,forestry, land use management, underground reser- voirs). These reductions may be temporary in thatthe removed carbon dioxide may be returned to theatmosphere at some point in the future throughintentional activities or accidental occurrences—such as harvesting of forestland or forest fires, etc. 2 The risk of reversibility should be assessed, togetherwith any mitigation or compensation measuresincluded in the project design.  AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE COUNTING. To avoid double counting, the reductions giving rise to the offset mustoccur at sources or sinks not included in the target orcap for which the offset is used. Also, if the reductionsoccur at sources or sinks owned or controlled bysomeone other than the parties to the project (i.e.,they are indirect), the ownership of the reductionshould be clarified to avoid double counting. Offsets may be converted into credits when used to meet an externally imposed target. Credits are convertible andtransferable instruments usually bestowed by an externalGHG program. They are typically generated from anactivity such as an emissions reduction project and thenused to meet a target in an otherwise closed system, suchas a group of facilities with an absolute emissions capplaced across them. Although a credit is usually based onthe underlying reduction calculation, the conversion of anoffset into a credit is usually subject to strict rules, whichmay differ from program to program. For example, aCertified Emission Reduction (CER) is a credit issued bythe Kyoto Protocol Clean Development Mechanism. Onceissued, this credit can be traded and ultimately used tomeet Kyoto Protocol targets. Experience from the “pre-compliance” market in GHG credits highlights theimportance of delineating project reductions that are tobe used as offsets with a credible quantification methodcapable of providing verifiable data. Reporting project based reductions It is important for companies to report their physicalinventory emissions for their chosen inventory bound-aries separately and independently of any GHG tradesthey undertake. GHG trades 3should be reported in its public GHG report under optional information—eitherin relation to a target (see chapter 11) or corporateGUIDANCEAccounting for GHG Reductions CHAPTER 8 60

inventory (see chapter 9). Appropriate information addressing the credibility of purchased or sold offsets orcredits should be included. When companies implement internal projects that reduce GHGs from their operations, the resulting reductions areusually captured in their inventory’s boundaries. Thesereductions need not be reported separately unless they aresold, traded externally, or otherwise used as an offset orcredit. However, some companies may be able to makechanges to their own operations that result in GHG emissions changes at sources not included in their owninventory boundary, or not captured by comparing emissions changes over time. For example: Substituting fossil fuel with waste-derived fuel thatmight otherwise be used as landfill or incineratedwithout energy recovery. Such substitution may haveno direct effect on (or may even increase) acompany’s own GHG emissions. However, it couldresult in emissions reductions elsewhere by anotherorganization, e.g., through avoiding landfill gas andfossil fuel use. Installing an on-site power generation plant (e.g., acombined heat and power, or CHP , plant) thatprovides surplus electricity to other companies mayincrease a company’s direct emissions, whiledisplacing the consumption of grid electricity by thecompanies supplied. Any resulting emissions reduc-tions at the plants where this electricity would haveotherwise been produced will not be captured in theinventory of the company installing the on-site plant. Substituting purchased grid electricity with an on-sitepower generation plant (e.g., CHP) may increase acompany’s direct GHG emissions, while reducing theGHG emissions associated with the generation of gridelectricity. Depending on the GHG intensity and thesupply structure of the electricity grid, this reductionmay be over- or underestimated when merelycomparing scope 2 emissions over time, if the latterare quantified using an average grid emission factor. These reductions may be separately quantified, for example using the GHG Protocol Project Quantification Standard, and reported in a company’s public GHG report under optional information in the same way asGHG trades described above. CHAPTER 8 Accounting for GHG Reductions 61GUIDANCEAlcoa, a global manufacturer of aluminum, is implementing avariety of strategies to reduce its GHG emissions. One approachhas been to purchase renewable energy certificates, or RECs, tooffset some of the company’s GHG emissions. RECs, which repre-sent the environmental benefits of renewable energy unbundledfrom the actual flow of electrons, are an innovative method ofproviding renewable energy to individual customers. RECs repre-sent the unbundled environmental benefits, such as avoided CO 2 emissions, generated by producing electricity from renewablerather than fossil sources. RECs can be sold bundled with theelectricity (as green power) or separately to customers interestedin supporting renewable energy. Alcoa found that RECs offer a variety of advantages, including direct access to the benefits of renewable energy for facilities thatmay have limited renewable energy procurement options. InOctober 2003, Alcoa began purchasing RECs equivalent to 100%of the electricity used annually at four corporate offices in T ennessee, Pennsylvania, and New York. The RECs Alcoa is purchasing effec-tively mean that the four corporate centers are now operating onelectricity generated by projects that produce electricity from land-fill gas, avoiding the emission of more than 6.3 million kilograms(13.9 million pounds) of carbon dioxide annually. Alcoa choseRECs in part because the supplier was able to provide RECs to allfour facilities through one contract. This flexibility lowered theadministrative cost of purchasing renewable energy for multiplefacilities that are served by different utilities. For more information on RECs, see the Green Power Market Development Group’s Corporate Guide to Green Power Markets:Installment #5 (WRI, 2003).Alcoa: Taking advantage of renewable energy certificates NOTES 1Primary effects are the specific GHG reducing elements or activities(reducing GHG emissions, carbon storage, or enhancing GHG removals)that the project is intended to achieve. 2This problem with the temporary nature of GHG reductions is sometimesreferred to as the “permanence” issue. 3The term “GHG trades” refers to all purchases or sales of allowances,offsets, and credits.

62 credible GHG emissions report presents relevant information that is complete, consistent, accurate and transparent. While it takes time to develop a rigorous and complete corporate inventory of GHG emissions, knowledge will improve with experience in calculating and reporting data. It istherefore recommended that a public GHG report: Be based on the best data available at the time of publication, while being transparent about its limitations Communicate any material discrepancies identified in previous years Include the company’s gross emissions for its chosen inventory boundary separate from and independent of any GHG trades it might engage in.

y following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard reporting requirements, users adopt a compre- hensive standard with the necessary detail and transparency for credible public reporting. The appropriate level of reporting of optional informationcategories can be determined by the objectives andintended audience for the report. For national or voluntary GHG programs, or for internal managementpurposes, reporting requirements may vary (Appendix Csummarizes the requirements of various GHG programs). For public reporting, it is important to differentiate between a summary of a public report that is, forexample, published on the Internet or in Sustainability/Corporate Social Responsibility reporting (e.g., Global Reporting Initiative) and a full public reportthat contains all the necessary data as specified by thereporting standard spelled out in this volume. Notevery circulated report must contain all information as specified by this standard, but a link or referenceneeds to be made to a publicly available full reportwhere all information is available. For some companies, providing emissions data for specific GHGs or facilities/business units, or reportingratio indicators, may compromise business confiden-tiality. If this is the case, the data need not be publiclyreported, but can be made available to those auditing theGHG emissions data, assuming confidentiality is secured. Companies should strive to create a report that is as transparent, accurate, consistent and complete aspossible. Structurally, this may be achieved by adoptingthe reporting categories of the standard (e.g., requireddescription of the company and inventory boundary,required information on corporate emissions, optionalinformation on emissions and performance, andoptional information on offsets) as a basis of the report.Qualitatively, including a discussion of the reportingcompany’s strategy and goals for GHG accounting,any particular challenges or tradeoffs faced, thecontext of decisions on boundaries and other accountingparameters, and an analysis of emissions trends may help provide a complete picture of the company’sinventory efforts. Double Counting Companies should take care to identify and exclude fromreporting any scope 2 or scope 3 emissions that are also reported as scope 1 emissions by other facilities,business units, or companies included in the emissionsinventory consolidation (see chapter 6). Use of ratio indicators Two principal aspects of GHG performance are ofinterest to management and stakeholders. One concernsthe overall GHG impact of a company—that is theabsolute quantity of GHG emissions released to theatmosphere. The other concerns the company’s GHGemissions normalized by some business metric thatresults in a ratio indicator. The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard requires reporting of absolute emissions; reporting of ratio indicators is optional. Ratio indicators provide information on performance relative to a business type and can facilitate compar-isons between similar products and processes over time.Companies may choose to report GHG ratio indicatorsin order to: Evaluate performance over time (e.g., relate figures from different years, identify trends in the data, andshow performance in relation to targets and baseyears (see chapter 11). Establish a relationship between data from different categories. For example, a company may want toestablish a relationship between the value that anaction provides (e.g., price of a tonne of product) andits impact on society or on the environment (e.g.,emissions from product manufacturing). Improve comparability between different sizes of busi- ness and operations by normalizing figures (e.g., byassessing the impact of different sized businesses onthe same scale). It is important to recognize that the inherent diversity of businesses and the circumstances of individualcompanies can result in misleading indicators.Apparently minor differences in process, product, orlocation can be significant in terms of environmentaleffect. Therefore, it is necessary to know the businesscontext in order to be able to design and interpretratio indicators correctly.CHAPTER 9 Reporting GHG Emissions 65GUIDANCEB

Companies may develop ratios that make most sense for their business and are relevant to their decision-making needs. They may select ratios for externalreporting that improve the understanding and clarifythe interpretation of their performance for theirstakeholders. It is important to provide some perspec-tive on issues such as scale and limitations ofindicators in a way that users understand the natureof the information provided. Companies shouldconsider what ratio indicators best capture the bene-fits and impacts of their business, i.e., its operations,its products, and its effects on the marketplace and onthe entire economy. Some examples of different ratioindicators are provided here.PRODUCTIVITY/EFFICIENCY RATIOS. Productivity/efficiency ratios express the value orachievement of a business divided by its GHG impact.Increasing efficiency ratios reflect a positive perform-ance improvement. Examples of productivity/efficiencyratios include resource productivity (e.g., sales perGHG) and process eco-efficiency (e.g., productionvolume per amount of GHG).GUIDANCEReporting GHG Emissions CHAPTER 9 66MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, an energy companybased in Iowa, wanted a method to track a power plant’s GHGintensity, while also being able to roll individual plant results into a corporate “generation portfolio” GHG intensity indicator.MidAmerican also wanted to be able to take into account the GHGbenefits from planned renewable generation, as well as measurethe impacts of other changes to its generation portfolio over time(e.g., unit retirements or new construction). The company adopteda GHG intensity indicator that specifically measures pounds ofdirect emissions over total megawatt hours generated (lbs/MWh). To measure its direct emissions, the company leverages data currently gathered to satisfy existing regulatory requirementsand, where gaps might exist, uses fuel calculations. For coal-fired units, that means mainly using continuous emissionsmonitoring (CEM) data and the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency’s emission factors for natural gas- and fuel oil-firedunits. Using the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard , the company completes an annual emission inventory for each of its fossil-fired plants, gathering together a) fuel volume and heat inputdata, b) megawatt production data, c) CEMs data, and d) fuelcalculations using appropriate emission factors. For example, in 2001, using CEM data and fuel calculations, the company’s Iowa utility business emitted roughly 23 million tonnesof CO 2, while generating approximately 21 million megawatt hours. Its 2001 GHG intensity indicator calculates to approximately2,177 lbs/MWh of CO 2, reflecting the Iowa utility company’s reliance on traditional coal-fired generation. By 2008, the Iowa utility company will have constructed a new 790 MW coal-fueled plant, a 540 MW combined-cycle natural gasplant, and a 310 MW wind-turbine farm and added them to itsgeneration portfolio. The utility company’s overall CO 2emissions will increase, but so will its megawatt production. The combinedemissions from the new coal- and gas-fired plants will be addedto the GHG intensity indicator’s numerator, while the megawattproduction data from all three facilities will be added to the indi-cator’s denominator. More importantly, and the ratio indicatorillustrates this, over time MidAmerican’s GHG intensity willdecline as more efficient generation is brought online and olderpower plants are used less or retired altogether.MidAmerican: Setting ratio indicators for a utility company

INTENSITY RATIOS. Intensity ratios express GHG impact per unit of physical activity or unit of economicoutput. A physical intensity ratio is suitable when aggre-gating or comparing across businesses that have similarproducts. An economic intensity ratio is suitable whenaggregating or comparing across businesses thatproduce different products. A declining intensity ratioreflects a positive performance improvement. Manycompanies historically tracked environmental perform-ance with intensity ratios. Intensity ratios are oftencalled “normalized” environmental impact data.Examples of intensity ratios include product emissionintensity (e.g., tonnes of CO 2emissions per electricity generated); service intensity (e.g., GHG emissions perfunction or per service); and sales intensity (e.g., emis-sions per sales). PERCENTAGES. A percentage indicator is a ratio between two similar issues (with the same physical unitin the numerator and the denominator). Examples ofpercentages that can be meaningful in performancereports include current GHG emissions expressed as apercentage of base year GHG emissions. For further guidance on ratio indicators refer to CCAR, 2003; GRI, 2002; Verfaillie and Bidwell, 2000. CHAPTER 9 Reporting GHG Emissions 67GUIDANCE

Although the practiceof verifying corporate GHG inventories is still evolving the emergence of widelyaccepted standards, such as the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and the forth- coming GHG Protocol Project Quantification Standard , should help GHG verification become more uniform, credible, and widely accepted. V10 Verification of GHG Emissions GUIDANCE

This chapter provides an overview of the key elements of a GHG verification process. It is relevant to companieswho are developing GHG inventories and have plannedfor, or are considering, obtaining an independent verifi-cation of their results and systems. Furthermore, as theprocess of developing a verifiable inventory is largely thesame as that for obtaining reliable and defensible data,this chapter is also relevant to all companies regardlessof any intention to commission a GHG verification. Verification involves an assessment of the risks of mate- rial discrepancies in reported data. Discrepancies relateto differences between reported data and data generatedfrom the proper application of the relevant standardsand methodologies. In practice, verification involves theprioritization of effort by the verifier towards the dataand associated systems that have the greatest impact onoverall data quality. Relevance of GHG principles The primary aim of verification is to provide confidenceto users that the reported information and associatedstatements represent a faithful, true, and fair account ofa company’s GHG emissions. Ensuring transparency andverifiability of the inventory data is crucial for verifica-tion. The more transparent, well controlled and welldocumented a company’s emissions data and systemsare, the more efficient it will be to verify. As outlined inchapter 1, there are a number of GHG accounting andreporting principles that need to be adhered to whencompiling a GHG inventory. Adherence to these princi-ples and the presence of a transparent, well-documentedsystem (sometimes referred to as an audit trail) is thebasis of a successful verification. Goals Before commissioning an independent verification, acompany should clearly define its goals and decidewhether they are best met by an external verification.Common reasons for undertaking a verification include: Increased credibility of publicly reported emissions information and progress towards GHG targets,leading to enhanced stakeholder trust Increased senior management confidence in reported information on which to base investment and target-setting decisionsImprovement of internal accounting and reporting practices (e.g., calculation, recording and internalreporting systems, and the application of GHGaccounting and reporting principles), and facilitatinglearning and knowledge transfer within the company Preparation for mandatory verification requirements of GHG programs. Internal assurance While verification is often undertaken by an independent,external third party, this may not always be the case.Many companies interested in improving their GHGinventories may subject their information to internalverification by personnel who are independent of the GHG accounting and reporting process. Bothinternal and external verification should follow similar procedures and processes. For external stakeholders,external third part verification is likely to significantlyincrease the credibility of the GHG inventory. However,independent internal verifications can also providevaluable assurance over the reliability of information. Internal verification can be a worthwhile learning expe- rience for a company prior to commissioning an externalverification by a third party. It can also provide externalverifiers with useful information to begin their work. The concept of materiality The concept of “materiality” is essential to understandingthe process of verification. Chapter 1 provides a usefulinterpretation of the relationship between the principle ofcompleteness and the concept of materiality. Informationis considered to be material if, by its inclusion or exclu-sion, it can be seen to influence any decisions or actionstaken by users of it. A material discrepancy is an error (for example, from an oversight, omission or miscalcula-tion) that results in a reported quantity or statementbeing significantly different to the true value or meaning.In order to express an opinion on data or information, averifier would need to form a view on the materiality ofall identified errors or uncertainties. While the concept of materiality involves a value judg- ment, the point at which a discrepancy becomes material( materiality threshold ) is usually pre-defined. As a rule of thumb, an error is considered to be materially misleading CHAPTER 10 Verification of GHG Emissions 69GUIDANCE

GUIDANCEVerification of GHG Emissions 70if its value exceeds 5% of the total inventory for the part of the organization being verified. The verifier needs to assess an error or omission in the full context within which information is presented. Forexample, if a 2% error prevents a company fromachieving its corporate target then this would most likelybe considered material. Understanding how verifiersapply a materiality threshold will enable companies tomore readily establish whether the omissions of an indi-vidual source or activity from their inventory is likely toraise questions of materiality. Materiality thresholds may also be outlined in the requirements of a specific GHG program or determinedby a national verification standard, depending on whois requiring the verification and for what reasons. Amateriality threshold provides guidance to verifiers onwhat may be an immaterial discrepancy so that they canconcentrate their work on areas that are more likely to lead to materially misleading errors. A materialitythreshold is not the same as de minimis emissions, or a permissible quantity of emissions that a company canleave out of its inventory. Assessing the risk of material discrepancy Verifiers need to assess the risk of material discrepancyof each component of the GHG information collection andreporting process. This assessment is used to plan anddirect the verification process. In assessing this risk, theywill consider a number of factors, including: The structure of the organization and the approach used to assign responsibility for monitoring andreporting GHG emissions The approach and commitment of management to GHG monitoring and reporting Development and implementation of policies and processes for monitoring and reporting (includingdocumented methods explaining how data is generatedand evaluated) Processes used to check and review calculation methodologies Complexity and nature of operations Complexity of the computer information system used to process the informationThe state of calibration and maintenance of meters used, and the types of meters used Reliability and availability of input data Assumptions and estimations applied Aggregation of data from different sources Other assurance processes to which the systems and data are subjected (e.g., internal audit, externalreviews and certifications). Establishing the verification parameters The scope of an independent verification and the level ofassurance it provides will be influenced by the company'sgoals and/or any specific jurisdictional requirements. Itis possible to verify the entire GHG inventory or specificparts of it. Discrete parts may be specified in terms ofgeographic location, business units, facilities, and type ofemissions. The verification process may also examinemore general managerial issues, such as quality manage-ment procedures, managerial awareness, availability ofresources, clearly defined responsibilities, segregation ofduties, and internal review procedures. The company and verifier should reach an agreement up- front on the scope, level and objective of the verification.This agreement (often referred to as the scope of work) willaddress issues such as which information is to be includedin the verification (e.g., head office consolidation only orinformation from all sites), the level of scrutiny to whichselected data will be subjected (e.g., desk top review or on-site review), and the intended use of the results of theverification). The materiality threshold is another item tobe considered in the scope of work. It will be of key consid-eration for both the verifier and the company, and is linkedto the objectives of the verification. The scope of work is influenced by what the verifier actu- ally finds once the verification commences and, as a result,the scope of work must remain sufficiently flexible toenable the verifier to adequately complete the verification. A clearly defined scope of work is not only important to the company and verifier, but also for externalstakeholders to be able to make informed and appro-priate decisions. Verifiers will ensure that specificexclusions have not been made solely to improve thecompany’s performance. To enhance transparency andcredibility companies should make the scope of workpublicly available. CHAPTER 10

--- Page 73 of 116 ---

Site visits Depending on the level of assurance required from verification, verifiers may need to visit a number of sitesto enable them to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidenceover the completeness, accuracy and reliability ofreported information. The sites visited should be repre-sentative of the organization as a whole. The selection ofsites to be visited will be based on consideration of anumber of factors, including: Nature of the operations and GHG sources at each site Complexity of the emissions data collection and calculation process Percentage contribution to total GHG emissions from each site The risk that the data from sites will be materially misstated Competencies and training of key personnel Results of previous reviews, verifications, and uncertainty analyses.Timing of the verification The engagement of a verifier can occur at various pointsduring the GHG preparation and reporting process.Some companies may establish a semi-permanentinternal verification team to ensure that GHG data stan-dards are being met and improved on an on-going basis. Verification that occurs during a reporting period allows for any reporting deficiencies or data issues to beaddressed before the final report is prepared. This maybe particularly useful for companies preparing highprofile public reports. However, some GHG programsmay require, often on a random selection basis, an inde-pendent verification of the GHG inventory following thesubmission of a report (e.g., World Economic ForumGlobal GHG Registry, Greenhouse Challenge program inAustralia, EU ETS). In both cases the verificationcannot be closed out until the final data for the periodhas been submitted. CHAPTER 10 Verification of GHG Emissions 71GUIDANCE PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), a global services company, hasbeen conducting GHG emissions verifications for the past 10 yearsin various sectors, including energy, chemicals, metals, semicon-ductors, and pulp and paper. PwC’s verification process involvestwo key steps: 1. An evaluation of whether the GHG accounting and reporting methodology (e.g., GHG Protocol Corporate Standard ) has been correctly implemented 2. Identification of any material discrepancies.TheGHG Protocol Corporate Standard has been crucial in helping PwC to design an effective GHG verification methodology. Since thepublication of the first edition, PwC has witnessed rapid improve-ments in the quality and verifiability of GHG data reported. Inparticular the quantification on non-CO 2GHGs and combustion emissions has dramatically improved. Cement sector emissionsverification has been made easier by the release of the WBCSDcement sector tool. GHG emissions from purchased electricity arealso easy to verify since most companies have reliable data on MWh consumed and emission factors are publicly available. However, experience has shown that for most companies, GHG data for 1990 is too unreliable to provide a verifiable base year for thepurposes of tracking emissions over time or setting a GHG target.Challenges also remain in auditing GHG emissions embedded inwaste fuels, co-generation, passenger travel, and shipping. Over the past 3 years PwC has noticed a gradual evolution of GHG verification practices from “customized” and “voluntary” to “standardized” and “mandatory.” The California Climate ActionRegistry, World Economic Forum Global GHG Registry and theforthcoming EU ETS (covering 12,000 industrial sites in Europe)require some form of emissions verification. In the EU ETS GHGverifiers will likely have to be accredited by a national body. GHGverifier accreditation processes have already been established inthe UK for its domestic trading scheme, and in California for regis-tering emissions in the CCAR.PricewaterhouseCoopers: GHG inventory verification— lessons from the field

Selecting a verifier Some factors to consider when selecting a verifier include their: previous experience and competence in undertaking GHG verifications understanding of GHG issues including calculation methodologies understanding of the company’s operations and industry objectivity, credibility, and independence. It is important to recognize that the knowledge and qual- ifications of the individual(s) conducting the verificationcan be more important than those of the organization(s)they come from. Companies should select organizationsbased on the knowledge and qualifications of their actualverifiers and ensure that the lead verifier assigned tothem is appropriately experienced. Effective verificationof GHG inventories often requires a mix of specializedskills, not only at a technical level (e.g., engineeringexperience, industry specialists) but also at a businesslevel (e.g., verification and industry specialists). Preparing for a GHG verification The internal processes described in chapter 7 are likelyto be similar to those followed by an independent veri-fier. Therefore, the materials that the verifiers need aresimilar. Information required by an external verifier islikely to include the following: Information about the company's main activities and GHG emissions (types of GHG produced, descriptionof activity that causes GHG emissions) Information about the company/groups/organiza- tion (list of subsidiaries and their geographiclocation, ownership structure, financial entitieswithin the organization) Details of any changes to the company’s organiza- tional boundaries or processes during the period,including justification for the effects of these changeson emissions dataDetails of joint venture agreements, outsourcing and contractor agreements, production sharing agree-ments, emissions rights and other legal or contractualdocuments that determine the organizational andoperational boundaries Docum ented procedures for identifying sources of emissions within the organizational and operationalboundaries Information on other assurance processes to which the systems and data are subjected (e.g. internal audit,external reviews and certifications) Data used for calculating GHG emissions. This might, for example, include: Energy consumption data (invoices, delivery notes,weigh-bridge tickets, meter readings: electricity,gas pipes, steam, and hot water, etc.) Production data (tonnes of material produced, kWhof electricity produced, etc.) Raw material consumption data for mass balancecalculations (invoices, delivery notes, weighbridgetickets, etc.) Emission factors (laboratory analysis etc.). Description of how GHG emissions data have been calculated: Emission factors and other parameters used andtheir justification Assumptions on which estimations are based Information on the measurement accuracy ofmeters and weigh-bridges (e.g., calibration records),and other measurement techniques Equity share allocations and their alignment withfinancial reporting Documentation on what, if any, GHG sources oractivities are excluded due to, for example, tech-nical or cost reasons. Information gathering process: Description of the procedures and systems used to collect, document and process GHG emissions dataat the facility and corporate level Description of quality control procedures applied(internal audits, comparison with last year’s data,recalculation by second person, etc.).GUIDANCEVerification of GHG Emissions CHAPTER 10 72

--- Page 75 of 116 ---

Other information: Selected consolidation approach as defined in chapter 3 list of (and access to) persons responsible forcollecting GHG emissions data at each site and atthe corporate level (name, title, e-mail, and tele-phone numbers) information on uncertainties, qualitative and ifavailable, quantitative. Appropriate documentation needs to be available to support the GHG inventory being subjected to externalverification. Statements made by management for whichthere is no available supporting documentation cannot beverified. Where a reporting com pany has not yet imple- mented systems for routinely accounting and recordingGHG emissions data, an external verification will bedifficult and may result in the verifier being unable toissue an opinion. Under these circumstances, the veri-fiers may make recommendations on how current datacollection and collation process should be improved sothat an opinion can be obtained in future years. Companies are responsible for ensuring the existence, quality and retention of documentation so as to createan audit trail of how the inventory was compiled. If a company issues a specific base year against which itassesses its GHG performance, it should retain all relevant historical records to support the base year data.These issues should be born in mind when designing andimplementing GHG data processes and procedures. Using the verification findings Before the verifiers will verify that an inventory has metthe relevant quality standard, they may require thecompany to adjust any material errors that they identi-fied during the course of the verification. If the verifiersand the company cannot come to an agreementregarding adjustments, then the verifier may not be ableto provide the company with an unqualified opinion. Allmaterial errors (individually or in aggregate) need to beamended prior to the final verification sign off.As well as issuing an opinion on whether the reported information is free from material discrepancy, the veri-fiers may, depending on the agreed scope of work, alsoissue a verification report containing a number of recom-mendations for future improvements. The process ofverification should be viewed as a valuable input to theprocess of continual improvement. Whether verificationis undertaken for the purposes of internal review, publicreporting or to certify compliance with a particularGHG program, it will likely contain useful informationand guidance on how to improve and enhance acompany’s GHG accounting and reporting system. Similar to the process of selecting a verifier, those selected to be responsible for assessing and imple-menting responses to the verification findings shouldalso have the appropriate skills and understanding ofGHG accounting and reporting issues.

GUIDANCE 74 etting targets is a routine business practice that helps ensure that an issue is kept on senior management’s “radar screen” and factored into relevant decisions about what products and services to provide and whatmaterials and technologies to use. Often, a corporate GHG emission reductiontarget is the logical follow-up to developing a GHG inventory. S11Setting a GHG Target GUIDANCE

--- Page 77 of 116 ---

This chapter provides guidance on the process of setting and reporting on a corporate GHG target. Although the chapter focuses on emissions, many of the consid-erations equally apply to GHG sequestration (see Appendix B). It is not the purpose of this chapter toprescribe what a company’s target should be, rather thefocus is on the steps involved, the choices to be made,and the implications of those choices. Why Set a GHG Target? Any robust business strategy requires setting targets forrevenues, sales, and other core business indicators, aswell as tracking performance against those targets.Likewise, effective GHG management involves setting a GHG target. As companies develop strategies to reducethe GHG emissions of their products and operations, corporate-wide GHG targets are often key elements ofthese efforts, even if some parts of the company are or will be subject to mandatory GHG limits. Commondrivers for setting a GHG target include:  MINIMIZING AND MANAGING GHG RISKS While developing a GHG inventory is an important step towards identifying GHG risks and opportunities,a GHG target is a planning tool that can actually driveGHG reductions. A GHG target will help raise internalawareness about the risks and opportunities presentedby climate change and ensure the issue is on the busi-ness agenda. This can serve to minimize and moreeffectively manage the business risks associated withclimate change.  ACHIEVING COST SAVINGS AND STIMULATING INNOVATION Implementing a GHG target can result in cost savings by driving improvements in process innovation andresource efficiency. Targets that apply to products candrive R&D, which in turn creates products and serv-ices that can increase market share and reduceemissions associated with the use of products.  PREPARING FOR FUTURE REGULATIONS Internal accountability and incentive mechanisms that are established to support a target’s implementationcan also equip companies to respond more effectivelyto future GHG regulations. For example, some compa-nies have found that experimenting with internal GHGtrading programs has allowed them to better under-stand the possible impacts of future trading programson the company.

DEMONSTRATING LEADERSHIP AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY With the emergence of GHG regulations in many parts of the world, as well as growing concern about theeffects of climate change, a commitment such assetting a public corporate GHG target demonstratesleadership and corporate responsibility. This canimprove a company’s standing with customers,employees, investors, business partners, and the public,and enhance brand reputation.  PARTICIPATING IN VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS A growing number of voluntary GHG programs are emerging to encourage and assist companies insetting, implementing, and tracking progress towardGHG targets. Participation in voluntary programscan result in public recognition, may facilitate recog-nition of early action by future regulations, andenhance a company’s GHG accounting and reportingcapacity and understanding. Steps in Setting a Target Setting a GHG target involves making choices amongvarious strategies for defining and achieving a GHGreduction. The business goals, any relevant policycontext, and stakeholder discussions should informthese choices. The following sections outline the ten steps involved. Although presented sequentially, in practice targetsetting involves cycling back and forth between the steps.It is assumed that the company has developed a GHGinventory before implementing these steps. Figure 12summarizes the steps. 1. Obtain senior management commitment As with any corporate wide target, senior managementbuy-in and commitment particularly at the board/CEOlevel is a prerequisite for a successful GHG reductionprogram. Implementing a reduction target is likely tonecessitate changes in behavior and decision-makingthroughout the organization. It also requires estab-lishing an internal accountability and incentive systemand providing adequate resources to achieve the target.This will be difficult, if not impossible, without seniormanagement commitment. GUIDANCESetting a GHG Target CHAPTER 11 76BOX 4. Comparing absolute and intensity targets ABSOLUTE TARGETS reduce absolute emissions over time (Example: reduce CO2by 25 percent below 1994 levels by 2010) Advantages •Designed to achieve a reduction in a specified quantity of GHGs emitted to the atmosphere •Environmentally robust as it entails a commitment to reduce GHGs by a specified amount •Transparently addresses potential stakeholder concerns about the need to manage absolute emissions Disadvantages •Target base year recalculations for significant structural changes to the organization add complexity to tracking progress over time •Does not allow comparisons of GHG intensity/efficiency •Recognizes a company for reducing GHGs by decreasing produc- tion or output (organic decline, see chapter 5) •May be difficult to achieve if the company grows unexpectedly and growth is linked to GHG emissions INTENSITY TARGETS reduce the ratio of emissions relative to a business metric over time (Example: reduce CO2by 12 percent per tonne of clinker between 2000 and 2008) Advantages •Reflects GHG performance improvements independent of organic growth or decline •Target base year recalculations for structural changes are usually not required (see step 4) •May increase the comparability of GHG performance among companies Disadvantages •No guarantee that GHG emissions to the atmosphere will be reduced—absolute emissions may rise even if intensity goesdown and output increases •Companies with diverse operations may find it difficult to define a single common business metric •If a monetary variable is used for the business metric, such as dollar of revenue or sales, it must be recalculated for changes inproduct prices and product mix, as well as inflation, addingcomplexity to the tracking process

TYPE OF TARGET Reduce absolute emissions MP: not normally constrained Reduce GHG intensity Improve BPE (efficiency) Improve PE (efficiency)LEVEL OF DECISION-MAKING (IN GENERAL AND ON TARGET) Corporate All levels depending on scale (e.g. new venture, new plant, operational) Business in consultation with corporate Business Business Facility, supported by Shell Global Solutions EnergiseTMCHAPTER 11 Setting a GHG Target 77GUIDANCEThe Royal Dutch/Shell Group, a global energy corporation, discovered when implementing its voluntary GHG reduction target that one of the biggest challenges was to cascade the target down to the actions of all employees who influence target performance. It was concluded that successful implementation required different targets at different levels of the company. This is because each of the compo nents that underlie absolute GHG emissions is influenced by decision-making at various management levels (from the corporate level down to indi- vidual businesses and facilities). Absolute GHG emissions at a plant (tonnes of CO2-e.) = Function (MP x BPE x PE) MP Quantity of product manufactured by a facility. This is fundamental to the need to grow and is therefore controlled at corporat e level. GHG emissions are typically not managed by limiting this component. BPE Best process energy use per tonne. The optimal (or theoretical) energy consumed (translates to emissions) by a particular design of plant. The type of plant built is a business-level decision. Significant capital decisions may be involved in buildin g a new plant incorporating new technology. For existing plants, BPE is improved by significant design change and retrofitting. Thi s could also involve large capital expenditure. PE Plant efficiency index. An index that indicates how the plant is actually performing relative to BPE. PE is a result of day-to- day decisions taken by plant operators and technicians. It is improved also by the Shell Global Solutions EnergiseTM programme, which typically requires low capital expenditure to implement. Royal Dutch/Shell found that while this model is probably an oversimplification when it comes to exploration and production fac ilities, it is suitable for manufacturing facilities (e.g., refineries and chemical plants). It illustrates that an absolute target could o nly be set at the corporate level, while lower levels require intensity or efficiency targets. Royal Dutch/Shell: The target cascade ACTIONS THAT REDUCE EMISSIONS See below -------- See below Building new plants with new technology Retrofitting and changing design of plants Increase plant operating efficiency 2. Decide on the target type There are two broad types of GHG targets: absolute and intensity-based. An absolute target is usually expressedin terms of a reduction over time in a specified quantityof GHG emissions to the atmosphere, the unit typicallybeing tonnes of CO 2-e. An intensity target is usually expressed as a reduction in the ratio of GHG emissionsrelative to another business metric. 1The comparative metric should be carefully selected. It can be the outputof the company (e.g. tonne CO 2-e per tonne product, per kWh, per tonne mileage) or some other metric such assales, revenues or office space. To facilitate transparency,companies using an intensity target should also report theabsolute emissions from sources covered by the target.Box 4 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each type of target. Some companies have both anabsolute and an intensity target. Box 5 provides exam-ples of corporate GHG targets. The Royal Dutch/Shellcase study illustrates how a corporate wide absolutetarget can be implemented by formulating a combina-tion of intensity targets at lower levels ofdecision-making within the company. 3. Decide on the target boundary The target boundary defines which GHGs, geographic oper-ations, sources, and activities are covered by the target.The target and inventory boundary can be identical, or

--- Page 80 of 116 ---

the target may address a specified subset of the sources included in the company inventory. The quality of the GHGinventory should be a key factor informing this choice. Thequestions to be addressed in this step include the following:  WHICH GHGS? Targets usually include one or more of the six major GHGs covered by the Kyoto Protocol.For companies with significant non-CO 2GHG sources it usually makes sense to include these to increase therange of reduction opportunities. However, practicalmonitoring limitations may apply to smaller sources.  WHICH GEOGRAPHICAL OPERATIONS? Only country or regional operations with reliable GHG inventorydata should be included in the target. For companieswith global operations, it makes sense to limit thetarget’s geographical scope until a robust and reli-able inventory has been developed for all operations.Companies that participate in GHG programsinvolving trading 2will need to decide whether or not to include the emissions sources covered in the tradingprogram in their corporate target. If common sourcesare included, i.e., if there is overlap in sources coveredbetween the corporate target and the trading program,companies should consider how they will address any double counting resulting from the trading ofGHG reductions in the trading program (see step 8).  WHICH DIRECT AND INDIRECT EMISSION SOURCES? Including indirect GHG emissions in a target will facilitate more cost-effective reductions by increasingthe reduction opportunities available. However, indirect emissions are generally harder to measureaccurately and verify than direct emissions althoughsome categories, such as scope 2 emissions frompurchased electricity, may be amenable to accuratemeasurement and verification. Including indirectemissions can raise issues with regard to ownershipand double counting of reductions, as indirect emis-sions are by definition someone else’s direct emissions(see step 8).  SEPARATE TARGETS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF BUSINESSES? For companies with diverse operations it may make more sense to define separate GHG targets fordifferent core businesses, especially when using anintensity target, where the most meaningful businessmetric for defining the target varies across businessunits (e.g., GHGs per tonne of cement produced orbarrel of oil refined).GUIDANCESetting a GHG Target CHAPTER 11 78BOX 5.

4. Choose the target base year For a target to be credible, it has to be transparent how target emissions are defined in relation to past emissions.Two general approaches are available: a fixed target baseyear or a rolling target base year. USING A FIXED TARGET BASE YEAR. Most GHG targets are defined as a percentage reduction in emis-sions below a fixed target base year (e.g., reduce CO 2 emissions 25 percent below 1994 levels by 2010).Chapter 5 describes how companies should track emis-sions in their inventory over time in reference to afixed base year. Although it is possible to use differentyears for the inventory base year and the target baseyear, to streamline the inventory and target reportingprocess, it usually makes sense to use the same yearfor both. As with the inventory base year, it is impor-tant to ensure that the emissions data for the targetbase year are reliable and verifiable. It is possible touse a multi-year average target base year. The sameconsiderations as described for multi-year average base years in chapter 5 apply. Chapter 5 provides standards on when and how to recalculate base year emissions in order to ensurelike-with-like comparisons over time when structuralchanges (e.g., acquisitions/divestitures) or changes inmeasurement and calculation methodologies alter theemissions profile over time. In most cases, this willalso be an appropriate approach for recalculating datafor a fixed target base year. USING A ROLLING TARGET BASE YEAR. Companies may consider using a rolling target base year ifobtaining and maintaining reliable and verifiable datafor a fixed target base year is likely to be challenging(for example, due to frequent acquisitions). With arolling target base year, the base year rolls forward atregular time intervals, usually one year, so that emis-sions are always compared against the previous year. 4 However, emission reductions can still be collectivelyCHAPTER 11 Setting a GHG Target 79GUIDANCETABLE 5. Comparing targets with rolling and fixed base years How might the target be stated? What is the target base year? How far back is like-with-like comparison possible? What is the basis for comparing emissions between the targetbase year and completion year? (see also Figure 14) How far back are recalculations made? How reliable are the target base year emissions? When are recalculations made?FIXED TARGET BASE YEAR A target might take the form “we will emit X% less in year B than in year A” A fixed reference year in the past The time series of absolute emissions will compare like with like The comparison over time is based on what is owned/controlled by the companyin the target completion year. Emissions are recalculated for all years back to the fixed target base year If a company with a target acquires a company that did not have reliable GHGdata in the target base year; back-casting of emissions becomes necessary,reducing the reliability of the base year ROLLING TARGET BASE YEAR A target might take the form of “over the next Xyears we will reduce emissions every year by Y%compared to the previous year” 5 The previous year If there have been significant structural changes the time series of absolute emissions will not comparelike with like over more than two years at a time The comparison over time is based on what was owned/controlled by the company in the years theinformation was reported 6 Emissions are recalculated only for the year prior to the structural change, or ex-post for the year of the structural change which then becomes thebase year. Data from an acquired company’s GHG emissions are only necessary for the year before the acquisi-tion (or even only from the acquisition onwards),reducing or eliminating the need for back-casting The circumstances which trigger recalculations for structural changes etc. (see chapter 5) are the same under both approaches 

--- Page 82 of 116 ---

stated over several years. An example would be “from 2001 through 2012, emissions will be reduced by onepercent every year, compared to the previous year.”When structural or methodological changes occur,recalculati ons only need to be made to the previous year. 7As a result, like-with-like comparisons of emissions in the “target starting year” (2001 in theexample) and “target completion year” (2012)cannot be made because emissions are not recalcu-lated for all years back to the target starting year. The definition of what triggers a base-year emissions recalculation is the same as under the fixed base yearapproach. The difference lies in how far back emissionsare recalculated. Table 5 compares targets using therolling and fixed base year approaches while Figure 14illustrates one of the key differences. RECALCULATIONS UNDER INTENSITY TARGETS While the standard in chapter 5 applies to absoluteinventory emissions of companies using intensitytargets, recalculations for structural changes for thepurposes of the target are not usually needed unless thestructural change results in a significant change in theGHG intensity. However, if recalculations for structuralchanges are made for the purposes of the target, theyshould be made for both the absolute emissions and thebusiness metric. If the target business metric becomesirrelevant through a structural change, a reformulationof the target might be needed (e.g., when a companyrefocuses on a different industry but had used anindustry-specific business metric before). 5. Define the target completion date The target completion date determines whether thetarget is relatively short- or long-term. Long-termtargets (e.g., with a completion year ten years from thetime the target is set) facilitate long-term planning forlarge capital investments with GHG benefits. However,they might encourage later phase-outs of less efficientequipment. Generally, long-term targets depend onuncertain future developments, which can have opportu-nities as well as risks, which is illustrated in Figure 13.A five-year target period may be more practical fororganizations with shorter planning cycles.6. Define the length of the commitment period The target commitment period is the period of timeduring which emissions performance is actually measuredagainst the target. It ends with the target completiondate. Many companies use single-year commitmentperiods, whereas the Kyoto Protocol, for example, speci-fies a multi-year “first commitment period” of five years(2008 –2012). The length of the target commitmentperiod is an important factor in determining a company’slevel of commitment. Generally, the longer the targetcommitment period, the longer the period during whichemissions performance counts towards the target.  EXAMPLE OF A SINGLE YEAR COMMITMENT PERIOD. Company Beta has a target of reducing emissions by 10 percent compared to its target base year 2000, bythe commitment year 2010. For Beta to meet its target,it is sufficient for its emissions to be, in the year 2010,no more than 90 percent of year 2000 emissions.  EXAMPLE OF A MULTI-YEAR COMMITMENT PERIOD. Company Gamma has a target of reducing emissions by 10 percent, compared to its target base year 2000,by the commitment period 2008–2012. For Gammato meet its target, its sum total emissions from2008–2012 must not exceed 90 percent of year2000 emissions times five (number of years in theGUIDANCESetting a GHG Target CHAPTER 11 80 FIGURE 13.

CHAPTER 11 Setting a GHG Target 81GUIDANCEFIGURE 14. Comparing a stabilization target under the fixed and rolling target base year approach Company B Company AA aquires B at the start of year 3 123➡ Company ANO CHANGENO CHANGEINCREASE Company A Fixed base year Rolling base year123 12 23➡➡ A stabilization target is one that aims to keep emissions constant over time. In this example, company A acquires company B, wh ich has experienced organic GHG growth since the target base year (or “starting” year). Under the rolling approach, emissions growth in the acquired company (B) from year 1 to year 2 does not appear as an emissions increase in relation to the target of the acquiring company (A). Thus company A would meet its stabilization target when using the rolling approach but not when using the fixed approach. In parallel to the example in chapter 5, past GHG growth or decline in divested facilities (GHG changes before the divestment) would affect the target performance under the rolling approach, while it would not be counted under the fixed approach. commitment period). In other words, its average emissions over those five years must not exceed 90 percent of year 2000 emissions. Target commitment periods longer than one year can be used to mitigate the risk of unpredictable events inone particular year influencing performance againstthe target. Figure 15 shows that the length of thetarget commitment period determines how many emis-sions are actually relevant for target performance. For a target using a rolling base year, the commitment period applies throughout: emission performance iscontinuously being measured against the target everyyear from when the target is set until the targetcompletion date. 7. Decide on the use of GHG offsets or credits8 A GHG target can be met entirely from internal reduc-tions at sources included in the target boundary orthrough additionally using offsets that are generatedfrom GHG reduction projects that reduce emissions atsources (or enhance sinks) external to the targetboundary. 9The use of offsets may be appropriate when FIGURE 15.

the cost of internal reductions is high, opportunities for reductions limited, or the company is unable to meet itstarget because of unexpected circumstances. Whenreporting on the target, it should be specified whetheroffsets are used and how much of the target reductionwas achieved using them. CREDIBILITY OF OFFSETS AND TRANSPARENCY There are currently no generally accepted methodologiesfor quantifying GHG offsets. The uncertainties thatsurround GHG project accounting make it difficult toestablish that an offset is equivalent in magnitude to theinternal emissions it is offsetting. 10This is why compa- nies should always report their own internal emissionsin separate accounts from offsets used to meet thetarget, rather than providing a net figure (see step 10).It is also important to carefully assess the credibility ofoffsets used to meet a target and to specify the originand nature of the offsets when reporting. Informationneeded includes:the type of project geographic and organizational origin how offsets have been quantified whether they have been recognized by external programs (CDM, JI, etc.) One important way to ensure the credibility of offsets is to demonstrate that the quantification methodologyadequately addresses all of the key project accountingchallenges in chapter 8. Taking these challenges intoaccount, the forthcoming GHG Protocol Project Quantification Standard aims to improve the consistency, credibility, and rigor of project accounting. Additionally, it is important to check that offsets have not also been counted towards another organization’sGHG target. This might involve a contract between thebuyer and seller that transfers ownership of the offset.Step 8 provides more information on accounting forGHG trades in relation to a corporate target, includingestablishing a policy on double counting. OFFSETS AND INTENSITY TARGETS When using offsets under intensity targets, all the aboveconsiderations apply. In order to determine compliancewith the target, the offsets can be subtracted from thefigure used for absolute emissions (the numerator); theresulting difference is then divided by the corresponding metric. It is important, however, that absolute emissionsare still reported separately both from offsets and thebusiness metric (see step 9 below). 8. Establish a target double counting policy This step addresses double counting of GHG reductionsand offsets, as well as allowances issued by externaltrading programs. It applies only to companies thatengage in trading (sale or purchase) of GHG offsets orwhose corporate target boundaries interface with othercompanies’ targets or external programs. Given that there is currently no consensus on how such double counting issues should be addressed, companiesshould develop their own “Target Double CountingPolicy.” This should specify how reductions and tradesrelated to other targets and programs will be reconciledwith their corporate target, and accordingly which typesof double counting situations are regarded as relevant.Listed here are some examples of double counting thatmight need to be addressed in the policy.  DOUBLE COUNTING OF OFFSETS. This can occur when a GHG offset is counted towards the target by both theselling and purchasing organizations. For example,company A undertakes an internal reduction projectthat reduces GHGs at sources included in its owntarget. Company A then sells this project reduction tocompany B to use as an offset towards its target, whilestill counting it toward its own target. In this case,reductions are counted by two different organizationsagainst targets that cover different emissions sources.Trading programs address this by using registries thatallocate a serial number to all traded offsets or creditsand ensuring the serial numbers are retired oncethey are used. In the absence of registries this couldbe addressed by a contract between seller and buyer.  DOUBLE COUNTING DUE TO TARGET OVERLAP .11 This can occur when sources included under a company’s corporate target are also subject to limitsby an external program or another company’s target.Two examples: Company A has a corporate target that includesGHG sources that are also regulated under a tradingprogram. In this case, reductions at the commonsources are used by company A to meet both itscorporate target and the trading program target. GUIDANCESetting a GHG Target CHAPTER 11 82

--- Page 85 of 116 ---

Company B has a corporate target to reduce its direct emissions from the generation of electricity.12 Company C who purchases electricity directly fromcompany B also has a corporate target thatincludes indirect emissions from the purchase ofelectricity (scope 2). Company C undertakes energyefficiency measures to reduce its indirect emissionsfrom the use of the electricity. These will usuallyshow up as reductions in both companies’ targets. 13 These two examples illustrate that double counting isinherent when the GHG sources where the reductions occurare included in more than one target of the same ordifferent organizations. Without limiting the scope oftargets it may be difficult to avoid this type of doublecounting and it probably does not matter if the doublecounting is restricted to the organizations sharing the samesources in their targets (i.e., when the two targets overlap).  DOUBLE COUNTING OF ALLOWANCES TRADED IN EXTERNAL PROGRAMS. This occurs when a corporate target overlaps with an external trading program andallowances that cover the common sources are sold inthe trading program for use by another organizationand reconciled with the regulatory target, but notreconciled with the corporate target. This examplediffers from the previous example in that doublecounting occurs across two targets that are not over-lapping (i.e., they do not cover the same sources).This type of double counting could be avoided if thecompany selling the allowances reconciles the tradewith its corporate target (see Holcim case study).Whatever the company decides to do in this situation,in order to maintain credibility, it should addressbuying and selling of allowances in trading programsin a consistent way. For example, if it decides not toreconcile allowances that it sells in a trading programwith its corporate target, it should also not count anyallowances of the same type that it purchases to meetits corporate target. Ideally a company should try to avoid double counting in its corporate target if this undermines the environmentalintegrity of the target. Also, any prevented doublecounting between two organizations provides an addi-tional incentive for one of these companies to furtherreduce emissions. However, in practice the avoidance ofdouble counting can be quite challenging, particularlyfor companies subject to multiple external programs andwhen indirect GHG emissions are included in the target.Companies should therefore be transparent about theirdouble counting policy and state any reasons for choosing not to address some double counting situations. The Holcim case study describes how one company has chosen to track performance towards its target andaddress double counting issues. 9. Decide on the target level The decision on setting the target level should beinformed by all the previous steps. Other considerationsto take into account include: Understanding the key drivers affecting GHG emis- sions by examining the relationship between GHGemissions and other business metrics, such as produc-tion, square footage of manufacturing space, numberof employees, sales, revenue, etc. Developing different reduction strategies based on the major reduction opportunities available and examiningtheir effects on total GHG emissions. Investigate howemissions projections change with different mitigationstrategies. Looking at the future of the company as it relates to GHG emissions. Factoring in relevant growth factors such as production plans, revenue or sales targets, and Return on Investment(ROI) of other criteria that drive investment strategy.

GUIDANCESetting a GHG Target CHAPTER 11 84Holcim: Using a GHG balance sheet to track performance towards the target Holcim, a global cement producer, tracks its performance in relation to its voluntary corporate target using a GHG balancesheet. This balance sheet shows, for each commitment periodand for each country business, on one side the actual GHGemissions and on the other side the GHG “assets” and“instruments.” These assets and instruments consist of thevoluntary GHG target itself (the “voluntary cap”; in otherwords, the allowances that Holcim provides for itself), a regu-latory target (“cap”) if applicable, plus the CDM creditspurchased (added) or sold (subtracted), and any regulatoryemissions trading allowances purchased (added) or sold(subtracted). Thus if any country business sells CDM credits(generated at sources inside the voluntary target boundary), itis ensured that only the buying organization counts the credit(see first example of double counting in step 8). At the end of the commitment period, every country business must demonstrate a neutral or positive balance towards Holcim’starget. Those companies whose voluntary cap overlaps with a regulatory cap (e.g., in Europe) must also demonstrate aneutral or positive balance towards the regulatory cap. GHGreductions in Europe are thus reported towards both targets(see second example of double counting in step 8). Both sides of the country business balance sheets are consoli- dated to group level. Credits and allowances traded within thegroup simply cancel out in the asset column of the consoli-dated corporate level GHG balance sheet. Any credits orallowances traded externally are reconciled with both thevoluntary and regulatory caps at the bottom line of the assetcolumn of the balance sheet. This ensures that any soldallowance is only counted by the buying organization (whenHolcim’s target and that of the buying organization do notoverlap). A purchased allowance or credit is counted towardsboth the voluntary and regulatory targets of the European busi-ness (these two targets overlap).

Considering whether there are any existing environmental or energy plans, capital investments, product/servicechanges, or targets that will affect GHG emissions.Are there plans already in place for fuel switching, on site power generation, and/or renewable energyinvestments that affect the future GHG trajectory? Benchmarking GHG emissions with similar organizations. Generally, organizations that havenot previously invested in energy and other GHG reductions should be capable of meeting more aggres-sive reduction levels because they would have morecost-effective reduction opportunities. 10. Track and report progress Once the target has been set, it is necessary to trackperformance against it in order to check compliance,and also—in order to maintain credibility—to reportemissions and any external reductions in a consistent,complete and transparent manner.  CARRY OUT REGULAR PERFORMANCE CHECKS. In order to track performance against a target, it is importantto link the target to the annual GHG inventory processand make regular checks of emissions in relation tothe target. Some companies use interim targets forthis purpose (a target using a rolling target base yearautomatically includes interim targets every year). REPORT INFORMATION IN RELATION TO THE TARGET. Companies should include the following information when setting and reporting progress in relation to a target: 1. Description of the target Provide an outline of the target boundaries chosen Specify target type, target base year, target completion date, and length of commitment period Specify whether offsets can be used to meet the target; if yes, specify the type and amount Describe the target double counting policy Specify target level. 2. Information on emissions and performance in rela- tion to the target Report emissions from sources inside the target boundary separately from any GHG trades If using an intensity target, report absolute emis- sions from within the target boundary separately, both from any GHG trades and the business metric Report GHG trades that are relevant to compliance with the target (including how many offsets were used to meet the target) Report any internal project reductions sold or transferred to another organization for use as an offset Report overall performance in relation to the target.CHAPTER 11 Setting a GHG Target 85GUIDANCE 1Some companies may formulate GHG efficiency targets by formulating this ratio the other way around. 2Examples include the U.K. ETS, the CCX, and the EU ETS. 3Holcim’s and Lafarge’s target have been formulated using the termi-nology of the WBCSD Cement CO2Protocol (WBCSD, 2001), which uses“specific” to denote emissions per tonne of cement produced. 4It is possible to use an interval other than one year. However, the longer the interval at which the base year rolls forward, the more this approachbecomes like a fixed target base year. This discussion is based on arolling target base year that moves forward at annual intervals. 5Note that simply adding the yearly emissions changes under the rollingbase year yields a different result from the comparison over time madewith a fixed base year, even without structural changes. In absoluteterms, an X% reduction every year over 5 years (compared to theprevious year) is not the same as an (X times 5) reduction in year 5compared to year 1. 6Depending on which recalculation methodology is used when applyingthe rolling base year, the comparison over time can include emissionsthat occurred when the company did not own or control the emissionsources. However, the inclusion of this type of information is mini-mized. See also the guidance document “Base year recalculationmethodologies for structural changes” on the GHG Protocol website(www.ghgprotocol.org).7For further details on different recalculation methodologies, see theguidance document “Base year recalculation methodologies for struc-tural changes” on the GHG Protocol website (www.ghgprotocol.org). 8As noted in chapter 8, offsets can be converted to credits. Credits arethus understood to be a subset of offsets. This chapter uses the termoffsets as a generic term. 9For the purposes of this chapter, the terms “internal” and “external”refer to whether the reductions occur at sources inside (internal) oroutside (external) the target boundary. 10This equivalence is sometimes referred to as “fungibility.” However,“fungibility” can also refer to equivalence in terms of the value inmeeting a target (two fungible offsets have the same value in meetinga target, i.e., they can both be applied to the same target). 11Overlap here refers to a situation when two or more targets include thesame sources in their target boundaries. 12Similarly, company A in this example could be subject to a mandatorycap on its direct emissions under a trading program and engage intrading allowances covering the common sources it shares withcompany B. In this case, the example in the section “Double countingof allowances traded in external programs” is more relevant. 13The energy efficiency measures implemented by company C may notalways result in an actual reduction of company B’s emissions.

his appendix provides guidance on how to account for and report indirect emissions associated withthe purchase of electricity. Figure A–1 provides an overview of the transactions associated withpurchased electricity and the corresponding emissions. Purchased electricity for own consumption Emissions associated with the generation of purchasedelectricity that is consumed by the reporting companyare reported in scope 2. Scope 2 only accounts for theportion of the direct emissions from generating elec-tricity that is actually consumed by the company. Acompany that purchases electricity and transports it in atransmission and distribution (T&D) system that it ownsor controls reports the emissions associated with T&Dlosses under scope 2. However, if the reporting companyowns or controls the T&D system but generates (ratherthan p urchases) the electricity transmitted through its wires, the emissions associated with T&D losses arenot reported under scope 2, as they would already beaccounted for under scope 1. This is the case whengeneration, transmission, and distribution systems arevertically integrated and owned or controlled by thesame company. Purchased electricity for resale to end-users Emissions from the generation of purchased electricityfor resale to end-users, for example purchases by autility company, may be reported under scope 3 in thecategory “generation of purchased electricity that issold to end-users.” This reporting category is particu-larly relevant for utility companies that purchasewholesale electricity supplied by independent powerproducers for resale to their customers. Since utilitycompanies and electricity suppliers often exercise choice over where they purchase electricity, thisprovides them with an important GHG reduction opportunity (see Seattle City Light case study in chapter 4). Since scope 3 is optional, companiesthat are unable to track their electricity sales in terms ofend users and non-end users can choose not to reportthese emissions in scope 3. Instead, they can report thetotal emissions associated with purchased electricity thatis sold to both end- and non-end-users under optionalinformation in the category “generation of purchasedelectricity, heat, or steam for re-sale to non-end users.” Purchased electricity for resale to intermediaries Emissions associated with the generation of purchasedelectricity that is resold to an intermediary (e.g.,trading transactions) may be reported under optionalinformation under the category “Generation ofpurchased electricity, heat, or steam for re-sale to non-end users.” Examples of trading transactions includebrokerage/trading room transactions involving purchasedelectricity or any other transaction in which electricity ispurchased directly from one source or the spot marketand then resold to an intermediary (e.g., a non-end user).These emissions are reported under optional informationseparately from scope 3 because there could be anumber of trading transactions before the electricityfinally reaches the end-user. This may cause duplicativereporting of indirect emissions from a series of electricitytrading transactions for the same electricity. 86Own consumption Resale to end-users Resale to intermediariesScope 2 Indirect emissions from own consumption of purchased electricity Scope 3 Indirect emissions from purchased electricity sold to end users Optional Information Emissions from purchased electricity sold to non end usersFIGURE A– 1.

APPENDIX A 87 GHG emissions upstream of the generation of electricity Emissions associated with the extraction and production of fuels consumed in the generation of purchased electricity may be reported in scope 3 under the cate-gory “extraction, production, and transportation offuels consumed in the generation of electricity.” These emissions occur upstream of the generation of electricity.Examples include emissions from mining of coal,refining of gasoline, extraction of natural gas, andproduction of hydrogen (if used as a fuel). Choosing electricity emission factors To quantify scope 2 emissions, the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard recommends that companies obtain source/supplier specific emission factors for the elec-tricity purchased. If these are not available, regional or grid emission factors should be used. For moreinformation on choosing emission factors, see the relevant GHG Protocol calculation tools available on the GHG Protocol website (www.ghgprotocol.org). GHG emissions associated with the consumption of electricity in T&D Emissions from the generation of electricity that is consumed in a T&D system may be reported in scope 3under the category “generation of electricity that isconsumed in a T&D system” by end-users. Publishedelectricity grid emission factors do not usually includeT&D losses. To calculate these emissions, it may benecessary to apply supplier or location specific T&D lossfactors. Companies that purchase electricity and trans-port it in their own T&D systems would report theportion of electricity consumed in T&D under scope 2. Accounting for indirect emissions associated with T&D losses There are two types of electricity emission factors: Emission factor at generation (EFG) and Emissionsfactor at consumption (EFC). EFG is calculated fromCO 2emissions from generation of electricity divided by amount of electricity generated. EFC is calculatedfrom CO 2emissions from generation divided by amount of electricity consumed. EFC and EFG are related as shown below. As these equations indicate, EFC multiplied by the amount of consumed electricity yields the sum of emissions attrib-utable to electricity consumed during end use andtransmission and distribution. In contrast, EFG multipliedby the amount of consumed electricity yields emissionsattributable to electricity consumed during end use only. Consistent with the scope 2 definition (see chapter 4), the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard requires the use of EFG to calculate scope 2 emissions. The use ofEFG ensures internal consistency in the treatment ofelectricity related upstream emissions categories andavoids double counting in scope 2. Additionally, thereare several other advantages in using EFG: 1) It is simpler to calculate and widely available in published regional, national, and international sources. 2) It is based on a commonly used approach to calculate emissions intensity, i.e., emissions per unit of produc-tion output. 3) It ensures transparency in reporting of indirect emis- sions from T&D losses. The formula to account for emissions associated with T&D losses is the following: In some countries such as Japan, local regulations may require utility companies to provide both EFG and EFC toits consumers, and consumers may be required to use EFCto calculate indirect emissions from the consumption ofpurchased electricity. In this case, a company still needs touse EFG to report its scope 2 emissions for a GHG reportprepared in accordance with GHG Protocol Corporate Standard .APPENDIX AEFC xELECTRICITY CONSUMED = EFG x(ELECTRICITY CONSUMED +T&D LOSSES) T&D LOSSES ELECTRICITY CONSUMEDEFG = EFC =TOTAL CO2EMISSIONS FROM GENERATION ELECTRICITY GENERATED TOTAL CO2EMISSIONS FROM GENERATION ELECTRICITY CONSUMED ( ) INDIRECT EMISSIONS FROM CONSUMPTION OF ELECTRICITY DURING T&DEFG x ELECTRICITY CONSUMED DURING T&D=EFC =EFG x 1+

key purpose of the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard is to provide companies with guidance on how to develop inventories that provide an accurate and complete picture of their GHG emissions both fromtheir direct operations as well as those along the valuechain. 1For some types of companies, this is not possible without addressing the company’s impacts onsequestered atmospheric carbon. 2 Sequestered atmospheric carbon During photosynthesis, plants remove carbon (as CO2) from the atmosphere and store it in plant tissue. Untilthis carbon is cycled back into the atmosphere, itresides in one of a number of “carbon pools.” Thesepools include (a) above ground biomass (e.g., vegeta-tion) in forests, farmland, and other terrestrialenvironments, (b) below ground biomass (e.g., roots),and (c) biomass-based products (e.g., wood products)both while in use and when stored in a landfill. Carbon can remain in some of these pools for long periods of time, sometimes for centuries. An increase inthe stock of sequestered carbon stored in these poolsrepresents a net removal of carbon from the atmos-phere; a decrease in the stock represents a net additionof carbon to the atmosphere. Why include impacts on sequestered carbon in corporate GHG inventories? It is generally recognized that changes in stocks of sequestered carbon and the associated exchanges ofcarbon with the atmosphere are important to nationallevel GHG emissions inventories, and consequently, theseimpacts on sequestered carbon are commonly addressedin national inventories (UNFCCC, 2000). Similarly, forcompanies in biomass-based industries, such as the forestproducts industry, some of the most significant aspects ofa company’s overall impact on atmospheric CO 2levels will occur as a result of impacts on sequestered carbon intheir direct operations as well as along their value chain.Some forest product companies have begun to addressthis aspect of their GHG footprint within their corporateGHG inventories (Georgia Pacific, 2002). Moreover,WBCSD’s Sustainable Forest Products Industry WorkingGroup—which represents a significant cluster of inte-grated forestry companies operating internationally—isdeveloping a project that will further investigate carbonmeasurement, accounting, reporting, and ownershipissues associated with the forest products value chain.Information on a company’s impacts on sequestered atmospheric carbon can be used for strategic planning, foreducating stakeholders, and for identifying opportunitiesfor improving the company’s GHG profile. Opportunitiesmay also exist to create value from reductions createdalong the value chain by companies acting alone or inpartnership with raw material providers or customers. Accounting for sequestered carbon in the context of the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard Consensus methods have yet to be developed under the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard for accounting of sequestered atmospheric carbon as it moves through thevalue chain of biomass-based industries. Nonetheless,some issues that would need to be addressed whenaddressing impacts on sequestered carbon in corporateinventories can be examined in the context of existingguidance provided by the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard as highlighted below. SETTING ORGANIZATIONAL BOUNDARIES The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard outlines two approaches for consolidating GHG data—the equity shareapproach and the control approach. In some cases, itmay be possible to apply these approaches directly toemissions/removals associated with sequestered atmos-pheric carbon. Among the issues that may need to beexamined is the ownership of sequestered carbon underthe different types of contractual arrangementsinvolving land and wood ownership, harvesting rights,and control of land management and harvesting deci-sions. The transfer of ownership as carbon movesthrough the value chain may also need to be addressed.In some cases, as part of a risk management programfor instance, companies may be interested in performingvalue chain assessments of sequestered carbon withoutregard to ownership or control just as they might do forscope 2 and 3 emissions. SETTING OPERATIONAL BOUNDARIES As with GHG emissions accounting, setting operationalboundaries for sequestered carbon inventories would helpcompanies transparently report their impacts onsequestered carbon along their value chain. Companiesmay, for example, provide a description of the valuechain capturing impacts that are material to the resultsof the analysis. This should include which pools are 88Accounting for Sequestered Atmospheric CarbonAPPENDIXB A

included in the analysis, which are not, and the rationale for the selections. Until consensus methodsare developed for characterizing impacts onsequestered atmospheric carbon along the value chain,this information can be included in the “optionalinformation” section of a GHG inventory compiledusing the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. TRACKING REMOVALS OVER TIME As is sometimes the case with accounting for GHG emis-sions, base year data for impacts on sequestered carbonmay need to be averaged over multiple years to accom-modate the year-to-year variability expected of thesesystems. The temporal scale used in sequestered carbonaccounting will often be closely tied to the spatial scaleover which the accounting is done. The question of howto recalculate base years to account for land acquisitionand divestment, land use changes, and other activitiesalso needs to be addressed. IDENTIFYING AND CALCULATING GHG REMOVALS The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard does not include consensus methods for sequestered carbon quantifica-tion. Companies should, therefore, explain the methodsused. In some instances, quantification methods usedin national inventories can be adapted for corporate-level quantification of sequestered carbon. IPCC(1997; 2000b) provides useful information on how todo this. In 2004, IPCC is expected to issue GoodPractice Guidance for Land Use, Land Use Changeand Forestry, with information on methods for quan-tification of sequestered carbon in forests and forestproducts. Companies may also find it useful to consultthe methods used to prepare national inventories forthose countries where significant parts of theircompany’s value chain reside. In addition, although corporate inventory accounting differs from project-based accounting (as discussedbelow), it may be possible to use some of the calculationand monitoring methods derived from project levelaccounting of sequestration projects. ACCOUNTING FOR REMOVAL ENHANCEMENTS A corporate inventory can be used to account for yearlyremovals within the corporate inventory boundary. In contrast, the forthcoming GHG Protocol Project Quantification Standard is designed to calculate project reductions that will be used as offsets, relative to a hypo- thetical baseline scenario for what would have happenedwithout the project. In the forestry sector, projects take theform of removal enhancements. Chapter 8 in this document addresses some of the issues that must be addressed when accounting for offsetsfrom GHG reduction projects. Much of this guidance isalso applicable to removal enhancement projects. One example is the issue of reversibility of removals — also briefly described in chapter 8. REPORTING GHG REMOVALS Until consensus methods are developed for character- izing impacts on sequestered atmospheric carbon alongthe value chain, this information can be included in the “optional information” section of the inventory (Seechapter 9). Information on sequestered carbon in thecompany’s inventory boundary should be kept separatefrom project-based reductions at sources that are not inthe inventory boundary. Where removal enhancementprojects take place within a company’s inventoryboundary they would normally show up as an increase incarbon removals over time, but can also be reported inoptional information. However, they should also be iden-tified separately to ensure that they are not doublecounted. This is especially important when they are soldas offsets or credits to a third party. As companies develop experience using various methods for characterizing impacts on sequesteredcarbon, more information will become available on thelevel of accuracy to expect from these methods. In theearly stages of developing this experience, however,companies may find it difficult to assess the uncer-tainty associated with the estimates and therefore mayneed to give special care to how the estimates arerepresented to stakeholders. 89 APPENDIX B NOTES 1In this Appendix, “value chain” means a series of operations and entities, starting with the forest and extending through end-of-lifemanagement, that (a) supply or add value to raw materials and inter-mediate products to produce final products for the marketplace and (b)are involved in the use and end-of-life management of these products. 2In this Appendix the term “sequestered atmospheric carbon” refersexclusively to sequestration by biological sinks.

A GHG credit is a convertible and transferable instrument usually bestowed by a GHG program.(Chapter 8, 11) GHG offset Offsets are discrete GHG reductions used to compensate for (i.e., offset) GHG emissions elsewhere, for example to meet a voluntary or mandatory GHG target or cap. Offsets are calculated relative to abaseline that represents a hypothetical scenario for what emissions would have been in the absenceof the mitigation project that generates the offsets. To avoid double counting, the reduction givingrise to the offset must occur at sources or sinks not included in the target or cap for which it is used. GHG program A generic term used to refer to any voluntary or mandatory international, national, sub-national, government or non-governmental authority that registers, certifies, or regulates GHG emissions orremovals outside the company. e.g. CDM, EU ETS, CCX, and CCAR. GHG project A specific project or activity designed to achieve GHG emission reductions, storage of carbon, or enhancement of GHG removals from the atmosphere. GHG projects may be stand-alone projects, or specific activities or elements within a larger non-GHG related project. (Chapter 8, 11) GHG Protocol calculation tools A number of cross-sector and sector-specific tools that calculate GHG emissions on the basis of activity data and emission factors (available at www.ghgprotocol.org). GHG Protocol Initiative A multi-stakeholder collaboration convened by the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development to design, develop and promote the use of accounting and reporting standards for business. It comprises of two separate but linked standards — the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the GHG Protocol Project Quantification Standard. GHG Protocol Project An additional module of the GHG Protocol Initiative addressing the quantification of GHG Quantification Standard reduction projects. This includes projects that will be used to offset emissions elsewhere and/or generate credits. More information available at www.ghgprotocol.org. (Chapter 8, 11) GHG Protocol sector specific A GHG calculation tool that addresses GHG sources that are unique to certain sectors, e.g., process calculation tools emissions from aluminum production. (see also GHG Protocol Calculation tools) GHG public report Provides, among other details, the reporting company’s physical emissions for its chosen inventory boundary. (Chapter 9) 98Glossary

GHG registry A public database of organizational GHG emissions and/or project reductions. For example, the US Department of Energy 1605b Voluntary GHG Reporting Program, CCAR, World Economic Forum’s GlobalGHG Registry. Each registry has its own rules regarding what and how information is reported.(Introduction, Chapter 2, 5, 8, 10) GHG removal Absorbtion or sequestration of GHGs from the atmosphere. GHG sink Any physical unit or process that stores GHGs; usually refers to forests and underground/deep sea reservoirs of CO 2. GHG source Any physical unit or process which releases GHG into the atmosphere. GHG trades All purchases or sales of GHG emission allowances, offsets, and credits. Global Warming Potential (GWP) A factor describing the radiative forcing impact (degree of harm to the atmosphere) of one unit of a given GHG relative to one unit of CO2. Group company / subsidiary The parent company has the ability to direct the financial and operating policies of a group company/subsidiary with a view to gaining economic benefits from its activities. (Chapter 3) Heating value The amount of energy released when a fuel is burned completely. Care must be taken not to confuse higher heating values (HHVs), used in the US and Canada, and lower heating values, used in all othercountries (for further details refer to the calculation tool for stationary combustion available atwww.ghgprotocol.org). Indirect GHG emissions Emissions that are a consequence of the operations of the reporting company, but occur at sources owned or controlled by another company. (Chapter 4) Insourcing The administration of ancillary business activities, formally performed outside of the company, using resources within a company. (Chapter 3, 4, 5, 9) Intensity ratios Ratios that express GHG impact per unit of physical activity or unit of economic value (e.g. tonnes of CO 2emissions per unit of electricity generated). Intensity ratios are the inverse of productivity/effi- ciency ratios. (Chapter 9, 11) Intensity target A target defined by reduction in the ratio of emissions and a business metric over time e.g., reduce CO2per tonne of cement by 12% between 2000 and 2008. (Chapter 11) Intergovernmental Panel on International body of climate change scientists. The role of the IPCC is to assess the scientific, Climate Change (IPCC) technical and socio-economic information relevant to the understanding of the risk of human-induced climate change (www.ipcc.ch). Inventory A quantified list of an organization’s GHG emissions and sources. Inventory boundary An imaginary line that encompasses the direct and indirect emissions that are included in the inven- tory. It results from the chosen organizational and operational boundaries. (Chapter 3, 4) Inventory quality The extent to which an inventory provides a faithful, true and fair account of an organization’s GHG emissions. (Chapter 7) Joint Implementation (JI) The JI mechanism was established in Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol and refers to climate change miti- gation projects implemented between two Annex 1 countries. JI allows for the creation, acquisitionand transfer of “emission reduction units” (ERUs). Kyoto Protocol A protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Once entered into force it will require countries listed in its Annex B (developed nations) to meet reduction targetsof GHG emissions relative to their 1990 levels during the period of 2008–12.GLOSSARY 99

Glossary 100Leakage (Secondary effect) Leakage occurs when a project changes the availability or quantity of a product or service that results in changes in GHG emissions elsewhere. (Chapter 8) Life Cycle Analysis Assessment of the sum of a product’s effects (e.g. GHG emissions) at each step in its life cycle, including resource extraction, production, use and waste disposal. (Chapter 4) Material discrepancy An error (for example from an oversight, omission, or miscalculation) that results in the reported quantity being significantly different to the true value to an extent that will influence performance ordecisions. Also known as material misstatement.(Chapter 10) Materiality threshold A concept employed in the process of verification. It is often used to determine whether an error or omission is a material discrepancy or not. It should not be viewed as a de minimus for defining acomplete inventory. (Chapter 10) Mobile combustion Burning of fuels by transportation devices such as cars, trucks, trains, airplanes, ships etc. (Chapter 6) Model uncertainty GHG quantification uncertainty associated with mathematical equations used to characterize the relationship between various parameters and emission processes. (Chapter 7) Non-Annex 1 countries Countries that have ratified or acceded to the UNFCC but are not listed under Annex 1 and are there- fore not under any emission reduction obligation (see also Annex 1 countries). Operation A generic term used to denote any kind of business, irrespective of its organizational, governance, or legal structures. An operation can be a facility, subsidiary, affiliated company or other form of jointventure. (Chapter 3, 4) Operating lease A lease which does not transfer the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee and is not recorded as an asset in the balance sheet of the lessee. Leases other than Operating leases areCapital/Financial/Finance leases. Consult an accountant for further detail as definitions of leasetypes differ between various accepted financial standards. (Chapter 4) Operational boundaries The boundaries that determine the direct and indirect emissions associated with operations owned or controlled by the reporting company. This assessment allows a company to establish which operationsand sources cause direct and indirect emissions, and to decide which indirect emissions to includethat are a consequence of its operations. (Chapter 4) Organic growth/decline Increases or decreases in GHG emissions as a result of changes in production output, product mix, plant closures and the opening of new plants. (Chapter 5) Organizational boundaries The boundaries that determine the operations owned or controlled by the reporting company, depending on the consolidation approach taken (equity or control approach). (Chapter 3) Outsourcing The contracting out of activities to other businesses. (Chapter 3, 4, 5) Parameter uncertainty GHG quantification uncertainty associated with quantifying the parameters used as inputs to estima- tion models. (Chapter 7) Primary effects The specific GHG reducing elements or activities (reducing GHG emissions, carbon storage, or enhancing GHG removals) that the project is intended to achieve. (Chapter 8) Process emissions Emissions generated from manufacturing processes, such as the CO 2that is arises from the break- down of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) during cement manufacture. (Chapter 4, Appendix D) Productivity/efficiency ratios Ratios that express the value or achievement of a business divided by its GHG impact. Increasing effi- ciency ratios reflect a positive performance improvement. e.g. resource productivity(sales per tonneGHG). Productivity/efficiency ratios are the inverse of intensity ratios. (Chapter 9) Ratio indicator Indicators providing information on relative performance such as intensity ratios or productivity/effi- ciency ratios. (Chapter 9)

(Chapter 8) Rolling base year The process of shifting or rolling the base year forward by a certain number of years at regular inter- vals of time. (Chapter 5, 11) Scientific Uncertainty Uncertainty that arises when the science of the actual emission and/or removal process is not completely understood. (Chapter 7) Scope Defines the operational boundaries in relation to indirect and direct GHG emissions. (Chapter 4) Scope 1 inventory A reporting organization’s direct GHG emissions. (Chapter 4) Scope 2 inventory A reporting organization’s emissions associated with the generation of electricity, heating/ cooling, or steam purchased for own consumption. (Chapter 4) Scope 3 inventory A reporting organization’s indirect emissions other than those covered in scope 2.

(Chapter 10) Secondary effects (Leakage) GHG emissions changes resulting from the project not captured by the primary effect(s). These are typically the small, unintended GHG consequences of a project. (Chapter 8) Sequestered atmospheric carbon Carbon removed from the atmosphere by biological sinks and stored in plant tissue. Sequestered atmospheric carbon does not include GHGs captured through carbon capture and storage. Significance threshold A qualitative or quantitative criteria used to define a significant structural change. It is the responsi- bility of the company/ verifier to determine the “significance threshold” for considering base yearemissions recalculation. In most cases the “significance threshold” depends on the use of the infor-mation, the characteristics of the company, and the features of structural changes. (Chapter 5) Stationary Combustion Burning of fuels to generate electricity, steam, heat, or power in stationary equipment such as boilers, furnaces etc. Structural change A change in the organizational or operational boundaries of a company that result in the transfer of ownership or control of emissions from one company to another. Structural changes usually resultfrom a transfer of ownership of emissions, such as mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, but can alsoinclude outsourcing/ insourcing. (Chapter 5) Target base year The base year used for defining a GHG target, e.g. to reduce CO 2emissions 25% below the target base year levels by the target base year 2000 by the year 2010. (Chapter 11) Target boundary The boundary that defines which GHG’s, geographic operations, sources and activities are covered by the target. (Chapter 11) Target commitment period The period of time during which emissions performance is actually measured against the target. It ends with the target completion date. (Chapter 11) Target completion date The date that defines the end of the target commitment period and determines whether the target is relatively short- or long-term. (Chapter 11)GLOSSARY 101

Glossary 102 Target double counting policy A policy that determines how double counting of GHG reductions or other instruments, such as allowances issued by external trading programs, is dealt with under a GHG target. It applies only tocompanies that engage in trading (sale or purchase) of offsets or whose corporate target boundariesinterface with other companies’ targets or external programs. (Chapter 11) Uncertainty 1. Statistical definition: A parameter associated with the result of a measurement that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could be reasonably attributed to the measured quantity. (e.g., thesample variance or coefficient of variation). (Chapter 7) 2. Inventory definition: A general and imprecise term which refers to the lack of certainty in emissions- related data resulting from any causal factor, such as the application of non-representative factors ormethods, incomplete data on sources and sinks, lack of transparency etc. Reported uncertainty information typically specifies a quantitative estimates of the likely or perceived difference between a reported value and a qualitative description of the likely causes of the difference. (Chapter 7). United Nations Framework Signed in 1992 at the Rio Earth Summit, the UNFCCC is a milestone Convention on Climate Change Convention on Climate Change treaty that provides an overall framework for international efforts to (UNFCCC) mitigate climate (UNFCCC) change. The Kyoto Protocol is a protocol to the UNFCCC. Value chain emissions Emissions from the upstream and downstream activities associated with the operations of the reporting company.
