based) (tCO2eq)
AR 49. To highlight potential transition risks, the undertaking may disclose its total GHG emissions disaggregated by
major countries and, if applicable, by operating segments (applying the same segments for the financial
statements as required by the accounting standards, i.e., IFRS 8 Operating Segments or local GAAP). Scope 3 GHG
emissions may be excluded from these breakdowns by country if the related data is not readily available.
AR 50. The Scope 3 GHG emissions may also be presented by according to the indirect emission categories defined in EN
ISO 14064-1:2018.
AR 51. If it is material for the undertaking's Scope 3 emissions, it shall disclose the GHG emissions from purchased cloud
computing and data centre services as a subset of the overarching Scope 3 category “upstream purchased goods
and services”.
AR 52. The total GHG emissions disaggregated by Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions may be graphically presented in the
sustainability statement (e.g., as a bar or pie chart) showing the split of GHG emissions across the value chain
(Upstream, Own operations, Transport, Downstream).
GHG intensity based on net revenue
Calculation guidance
AR 53. When disclosing the information on GHG intensity based on net revenue required under paragraph 53, the
undertaking shall:
(a) calculate the GHG intensity ratio by the following formula:
(b) express the total GHG emissions in metric tonnes of CO2eq and the net revenue in monetary units (e.g., Euros)
and present the results for the market-based and location-based method;
(c) include the total GHG emissions in the numerator and overall net revenue in the denominator;
(d) calculate the total GHG emissions as required by paragraphs 44 (d) and 52; and
(e) calculate the net revenue in line with the requirements in accounting standards applied for financial
statements, i.e., IFRS 15 or local GAAP.
AR 54. The quantitative information may be presented in the following tabular format.
GHG intensity per net revenue Comparative N % N / N-1
