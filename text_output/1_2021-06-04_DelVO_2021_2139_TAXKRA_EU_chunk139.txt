Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the 
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set for anaerobic treatment of
waste in the latest relevant best available techniques (BAT) conclusions,
including the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for waste treat ­
ment (  214  ). No significant cross-media effects occur. 
Where the resulting digestate is intended for use as fertiliser or soil
improver, its nitrogen content (with tolerance level ± 25 %) is
communicated to the buyer or the entity in charge of taking off the
digestate.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
5.7.  Anaerobic digestion of bio-waste  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of dedicated facilities for the treatment of separately collected bio-waste (  215  ) through 
anaerobic digestion with the resulting production and utilisation of biogas and digestate and/or chemicals.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E38.21 and
F42.99 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. A monitoring and contingency plan is in place in order to minimise methane leakage at the facility.
2. The produced biogas is used directly for the generation of electricity or heat, or upgraded to bio-methane
for injection in the natural gas grid, or used as vehicle fuel or as feedstock in chemical industry.
3. The bio-waste that is used for anaerobic digestion is source segregated and collected separately.
4. The produced digestate is used as fertiliser or soil improver, either directly or after composting or any other
treatment.
5. In the dedicated bio-waste treatment plants, the share of food and feed crops (  216  ) used as input feedstock, 
measured in weight, as an annual average, is less than or equal to 10 % of the input feedstock.
