I (Acts whose publication is obligatory) REGULATION (EC) No 1893/2006 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 20 December 2006 establishing the statistical classification of economic activities NACE Revision 2 and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 as well as certain EC Regulations on specific statistical domains (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Commu- nity, and in particular Article 285(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (1), Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2), Whereas: (1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 (3) established the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (hereinafter referred to as ‘NACE Rev. 1’ or‘NACE Rev. 1.1’). (2) In order to reflect the technological development and structural changes of the economy, an up-to-date classifica- tion, called NACE Revision 2, should be established(hereinafter referred to as ‘NACE Rev. 2’). (3) An up-to-date classification such as NACE Rev. 2 is central to the Commission's ongoing efforts to modernise the production of Community statistics; it is expected tocontribute, through more comparable and relevant data, tobetter economic governance at both Community andnational level. (4) In order to function, the internal market requires statistical standards applicable to the collection, transmission and publication of national and Community statistics so thatbusinesses, financial institutions, governments and all otheroperators in the internal market can have access to reliableand comparable statistical data. To this end, it is vital thatthe various categories for classifying activities in theCommunity be interpreted uniformly in all the Member States. (5) Reliable and comparable statistics are necessary to enable businesses to assess their competitiveness, and are useful to the Community institutions in preventing distortions ofcompetition. (6) The establishment of a revised common statistical classifi- cation of economic activities does not oblige Member States to collect, publish or supply data. Only if the Member Statesuse activity classifications linked to the Communityclassification is it possible to provide integrated informationwith the reliability, speed, flexibility and degree of detailrequired for the management of the internal market. (7) Provision should be made for the Member States to be able, in order to meet national requirements, to integrate into their national classifications additional categories based onthe statistical classification of economic activities in theCommunity. (8) The international comparability of economic statistics requires that the Member States and the Community institutions use classifications of economic activities whichare directly linked to the International Standard IndustrialClassification of all economic activities (ISIC) Rev. 4, asadopted by the Statistical Commission of the UnitedNations. (9) Use of the classification of economic activities in the Community requires that the Commission be assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee set up by Coun-cil Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom ( 4) in particular as regards: the examination of problems arising fromimplementation of NACE Rev. 2; ensuring a fullycoordinated transition from NACE Rev. 1 to NACE Rev. 2;and, the preparation of future amendments to NACE Rev. 2.30.12.2006 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 393/1 (1) OJ C 79, 1.4.2006, p. 31.

(10) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2186/93 (1) established a common framework for setting up statistical business registers with harmonised definitions, characteristics, scopeand updating procedures. (11) The establishment of a revised statistical classification of economic activities makes it necessary to modify specific- ally various references to NACE Rev. 1 as well as to amend anumber of relevant instruments. It is therefore necessary toamend the following instruments: Regulation (EEC)No 3037/90; Council Regulation (EEC) No 3924/91 of19 December 1991 on the establishment of a Communitysurvey of industrial production ( 2); Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 58/97 of 20 December 1996 concerningstructural business statistics ( 3); Council Regulation (EC) No 1165/98 of 19 May 1998 concerning short termstatistics ( 4); Council Regulation (EC) No 1172/98 of 25 May 1998 on statistical returns in respect of thecarriage of goods by road ( 5); Council Regulation (EC) No 530/1999 of 9 March 1999 concerning structuralstatistics on earnings and on labour costs ( 6); Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002 of the European Parliament and of theCouncil of 25 November 2002 on waste statistics ( 7); Regulation (EC) No 450/2003 of the European Parliamentand of the Council of 27 February 2003 concerning thelabour cost index ( 8); Regulation (EC) No 48/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 December2003 on the production of annual Community statistics onthe steel industry for the reference years 2003-2009 ( 9); Regulation (EC) No 808/2004 of the European Parliamentand of the Council of 21 April 2004 concerningCommunity statistics on the information society ( 10); and, Regulation (EC) No 1552/2005 of the European Parliamentand of the Council of 7 September 2005 on statisticsrelating to vocational training in enterprises ( 11). (12) A number of Community instruments need to be amended, according to the specific procedures applicable to them, before transition to NACE Rev. 2, namely: CouncilRegulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on theEuropean system of national and regional accounts in the Community ( 12); Regulation (EC) No 138/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 December2003 on the economic accounts for agriculture in theCommunity ( 13); and Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 of the European Parliament and the Council of 12 January 2005on Community statistics concerning balance of payments,international trade in services and foreign direct invest-ment ( 14). (13) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down theprocedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 15). (14) In particular, power should be conferred on the Commis- sion to amend or supplement NACE Rev. 2 in order to take account of technological or economic developments or toalign it with other economic and social classifications. Sincethese measures are of general scope and designed to amendnon-essential elements of this Regulation or to supplementthis Regulation by the addition of new non-essentialelements, they should be adopted in accordance with theregulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for inArticle 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC. (15) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the creation of common statistical standards that permit the production of harmonised data, cannot be sufficiently achieved by theMember States and can therefore be better achieved atCommunity level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle ofproportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulationdoes not go beyond what is necessary to achieve thatobjective.

economic reality and enhances the comparability of national, Community and international classifications and, hence, ofnational, Community and international statistics. 2. This Regulation shall apply only to the use of the classification for statistical purposes. Article 2 NACE Rev. 2 1. NACE Rev. 2 shall include: (a) a first level consisting of headings identified by an alphabetical code (sections); (b) a second level consisting of headings identified by a two- digit numerical code (divisions); (c) a third level consisting of headings identified by a three- digit numerical code (groups); and (d) a fourth level consisting of headings identified by a four- digit numerical code (classes). 2. NACE Rev. 2 is set out in Annex I. Article 3 Use of NACE Rev. 2 The Commission shall use NACE Rev. 2 for all statistics classified according to economic activities. Article 4 National classifications of economic activities 1. Member States' statistics presented according to economic activities shall be produced using NACE Rev. 2 or a nationalclassification derived therefrom. 2. The national classification may introduce additional head- ings and levels and a different coding may be used. Each of thelevels, except for the highest, shall consist of either the sameheadings as the corresponding NACE Rev. 2 level or headingsconstituting an exact breakdown thereof. 3. Member States shall forward to the Commission, for its approval prior to their publication, the drafts defining ormodifying their national classifications. The Commission shallcheck the conformity of these drafts with paragraph 2 withintwo months. The Commission shall transmit the approvednational classification to the other Member States for informa-tion. The Member States' national classifications shall include atable of correspondence between the national classifications andNACE Rev. 2. 4. In the event of incompatibility between certain NACE Rev. 2 headings and the national economic structure, the Commissionmay authorise a Member State to use an aggregation of NACERev. 2 headings in a specific sector. To obtain such an authorisation, the Member State concerned must provide the Commission with all the necessary informationto consider its request. The Commission shall decide within three months. However, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, such an authorisation shall not entitle the Member State concerned tosubdivide the aggregated headings in a way different from NACERev. 2. 5. The Commission shall, together with the Member State concerned, periodically review the authorisations granted underparagraph 4 to verify whether they remain justified. Article 5 Commission activities The Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, shall ensure the dissemination, maintenance and promotion of NACERev. 2, in particular by: (a) drafting, updating and publishing explanatory notes for NACE Rev. 2; (b) drawing up and publishing guidelines for classifying statistical units in accordance with NACE Rev. 2; (c) publishing correspondence tables between NACE Rev. 1.1 and NACE Rev. 2 and between NACE Rev. 2 and NACERev. 1.1; and (d) working to improve consistency with other social and economic classifications.
