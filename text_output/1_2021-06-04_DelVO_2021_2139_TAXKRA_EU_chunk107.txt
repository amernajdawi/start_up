Where an economic activity is an integral element of the ‘Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy
technologies’ as referred to in Section 7.6 of this Annex, the technical screening criteria specified in Section 7.6
apply.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular D35.11 and
F42.22 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The activity generates electricity from wind power.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  In case of construction of offshore wind, the activity does not hamper the 
achievement of good environmental status as set out in Directive
2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (  158  ), 
requiring that the appropriate measures are taken to prevent or mitigate
impacts in relation to that Directive’s Descriptor 11 (Noise/Energy), laid
down in Annex I to that Directive, and as set out in Commission Decision
(EU) 2017/848 (  159  ) in relation to the relevant criteria and methodological 
standards for that descriptor.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  The activity assesses availability of and, where feasible, uses equipment and 
components of high durability and recyclability and that are easy to
dismantle and refurbish.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  N/A  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex (  160  ). 
In case of offshore wind, the activity does not hamper the achievement of
good environmental status as set out in Directive 2008/56/EC, requiring
that the appropriate measures are taken to prevent or mitigate impacts in
relation to that Directive’s Descriptors 1 (biodiversity) and 6 (seabed inte ­
grity), laid down in Annex I to that Directive, and as set out in Decision
(EU) 2017/848 in relation to the relevant criteria and methodological
standards for those descriptors.  
4.4.  Electricity generation from ocean energy technologies  
Description of the activity  
Construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity from ocean energy.  
___________  
( 158  ) Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 establishing a framework for community 
action in the field of marine environmental policy (Marine Strategy Framework Directive) (OJ L 164, 25.6.2008, p. 19).  
( 159  ) Commission Decision (EU) 2017/848 of 17 May 2017 laying down criteria and methodological standards on good environmental 
status of marine waters and specifications and standardised methods for monitoring and assessment, and repealing Decision
2010/477/EU (OJ L 125, 18.5.2017, p. 43).  
( 160  ) Practical guidance for the implementation of this criterion is contained in the European Commission notice C(2020) 7730 final  
“Guidance document on wind energy developments and EU nature legislation”, (version of 4.6.2021: https://ec.europa.eu/
environment/nature/natura2000/management/docs/wind_farms_en.pdf).EN  L 442/64 Official Journal of the European Union 9.12.2021
