ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 205/284(b) any geographies, at country level or other levels, or commodities for which there is a significant risk of child
labour , or of forced labour or compulsory labour, among workers in the undertaking’s value chain (104);
(c) in the case of material negative impacts, whether they are either (i) widespread or systemic in contexts where the
undertaking operates or has sourcing or other business relationships (e.g., child labour or forced labour in
particular commodity supply chains in specific countries or regions), or (ii) related to individual incidents (e.g.,
an industrial accident or an oil spill) or to specific business relationships. This includes consideration of impacts on value chain workers that may arise from the transition to greener and climate-neutral operations. Potential
impacts include impacts associated with innovation and restructuring, closure of mines, increased mining of minerals needed for the transition to a sustainable economy, and solar panel production;
(d) in the case of material positive impacts, a brief description of the activities that result in the positive impacts (e.g., updated purchasing practices, capacity-building to supply chain workers), including providing opportunities for
the workforce such as job creation and upskilling in the context of a ‘just transition’, and the types of value chain
workers that are positively affected or could be positively affected; the undertaking may also disclose whether the
positive impacts occur in specific countries or regions; and
(e) any material risks and opportunities for the undertaking arising from impacts and dependencies on value chain
workers.
12. In describing the main types of value chain workers who are or could be negatively affected, based on the materiality
assessment set out in ESRS 2 IRO-1, the undertaking shall disclose whether and how it has developed an understanding of how workers with particular characteristics, those working in particular contexts, or those
undertaking particular activities may be at greater risk of harm.
13. The undertaking shall disclose which, if any, of its material risks and opportunities arising from impacts and
dependencies on its value chain workers relate to specific groups of value chain workers (for example, particular age
groups, workers in a particular factory or country) rather than to all of the value chain workers.
