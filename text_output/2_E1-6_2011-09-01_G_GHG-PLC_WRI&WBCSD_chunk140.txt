guidanceCHAPTER 11 Calculating Inventory Results[89]
3.   Calculate total inventory results  
(CO2e/unit of analysis)
Once the inventory results in CO2e are calculated, the
company  needs to ensure that all results are on the same 
reference flow basis. For example, if the reference flow
for the studied product is 10 kg and the inventory results
are per kg of product, all the inventory results need to
multiplied by 10. Because the reference flow represents
to amount of product needed to fulfil the unit of
analysis, results on the reference flow basis are summed
together to calculate the total CO2e/unit of analysis. More
information on reference flows and unit of analysis is
available in chapter 6.
The following components make up the total inventory
results:The total CO2e/unit of analysis represents the amount
of CO2 equivalent GHGs entering the atmosphere as a
result of fulfilling the function of a product. Therefore,
emissions are treated as positive values and removals are
treated as negative values.
Land-use change impacts are included in the total
inventory results if they are attributable to the studied
product. Guidance on calculating land-use change impacts
is included in Appendix B. If no land-use change impacts
are attributable and no removals occur during the
product’s life cycle, the total inventory results are simply
the sum of emissions in CO2e per reference flow.

[90]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard
guidance4.    Calculate percentage of total inventory 
results by life cycle stage
The inventory results per life cycle stage are calculated
using the same equation given in step 3 above. Land-use
change impacts and removals are typically included in the
material acquisition and preprocessing or production stage
depending on the perception of the reporting company.
In some cases removals may occur during the use stage
(e.g. the absorption of CO2 by cement).  If the removals are 
large enough to create a negative percent impact from that
stage, this should be noted clearly in the inventory report.
The following equation is used to determine the
percentage of total inventory results by life cycle stage:
Percentage per   =       CO2e per life  cycle stage  
   Total CO2e inventory results      x   100
