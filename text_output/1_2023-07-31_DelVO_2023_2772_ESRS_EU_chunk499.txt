ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 210/284Appendix A
Application Requirements
This appendix is an integral part of the ESRS S2 Workers in the value chain. It supports the application of the disclosure
requirements set out in this standard and has the same authority as the other parts of ESRS S2.
Objective
AR 1. In addition to the issues listed in paragraph 2, the undertaking may also consider disclosing information about
other issues relevant to a material impact for a shorter period of time, for instance initiatives regarding the health
and safety of value chain workers during a pandemic.
AR 2. The overview of social and human rights matters provided in paragraph 2 is not meant to imply that all of these
issues should be disclosed in each Disclosure Requirement in this Standard. Rather, it provides a list of matters
that the undertaking shall consider in its materiality assessment (ref. to ESRS 1 chapter 3 Double materiality as the
basis for sustainability disclosures and ESRS 2 IRO-1) related to value chain workers and, as appropriate, disclose as
material impacts, risks and opportunities within the scope of this Standard.
AR 3. Examples of workers that fall within the scope of this Standard are:
(a) workers of outsourced services working in the workplace of the undertaking (e.g., third party catering or security workers);
(b) workers of a supplier contracted by the undertaking who work on the supplier’s premises using the supplier’s
work methods;
(c) workers for a ‘downstream’ entity which purchases goods or services from the undertaking;
(d) workers of an equipment supplier to the undertaking who, at a workplace controlled by the undertaking,
perform regular maintenance on the supplier’s equipment (e.g., photocopier) as stipulated in the contract
between the equipment supplier and the undertaking; and
(e) workers deeper in the supply chain who are extracting commodities that are then processed into components
that go in the undertaking’s products.
ESRS 2 General disclosures
Strategy
Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-2 - Interests and views of stakeholders
AR 4. Disclosure Requirement ESRS 2 SBM-2 requires the undertaking to provide an understanding of whether and how
it considers the role that its strategy and business model may play in creating, exacerbating or mitigating
significant material impacts on value chain workers, and whether and how the business model and strategy are
adapted to address such material impacts.
AR 5. While value chain workers may not be engaging with the undertaking at the level of its strategy or business model,
