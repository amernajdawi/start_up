(i) GAR for lending activities to equity holdings of non-financial undertakings for loans and advances (GAR L&A)
Credit institutions shall use and disclose the following items for the calculation of the GAR for this type of exposures:
(1)(a) total loans and advances to non-financial undertakings, including loans and advances recognised under the
