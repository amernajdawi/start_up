ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 54/164Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)
(1) Climate change mitigation The building is not dedicated to extraction, storage, transport or manufacture of fossil
fuels.
The Primary Energy Demand (PED) (87)setting out the energy performance of the
building resulting from the construction does not exceed the threshold set for the
nearly zero-energy building (NZEB) requirements in national regulation implementing
Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (88). The energy
performance is certified using an as built Energy Performance Certificate (EPC).
(2) Climate change adaptation The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.
(3) Sustainable use and protec ­
tion of water and marine
resourcesWhere installed, except for installations in residential building units, the specified water
use for the following water appliances are attested by product datasheets, a building
certification or an existing product label in the Union, in accordance with the technical
specifications laid down in Appendix E to Annex I to Delegated Regulation
(EU) 2021/2139:
(a) washhand basin taps and kitchen taps have a maximum water flow of 6 litres/min;
(b) showers have a maximum water flow of 8 litres/min;
(c) WCs, including suites, bowls and flushing cisterns, have a full flush volume of a
maximum of 6 litres and a maximum average flush volume of 3,5 litres;
(d) urinals use a maximum of 2 litres/bowl/hour. Flushing urinals have a maximum full
flush volume of 1 litre.
To avoid impact from the construction site, the activity complies with the criteria set out
in Appendix B to this Annex.
(5) Pollution prevention and controlBuilding components and materials used in the construction comply with the criteria set out in Appendix C to this Annex.
Building components and materials used in the construction that may come into contact
with occupiers (
89)emit less than 0,06 mg of formaldehyde per m3 of test chamber air
upon testing in accordance with the conditions specified in Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 and less than 0,001 mg of other categories 1A and 1B
carcinogenic volatile organic compounds per m
3 of test chamber air, upon testing in
accordance with CEN/EN 16516 (90)or ISO 16000-3:2011 (91)or other equivalent
standardised test conditions and determination methods (92).
(87)The calculated amount of energy needed to meet the energy demand associated with the typical uses of a building expressed by a
numeric indicator of total primary energy use in kWh/m2 per year and based on the relevant national calculation methodology and as
displayed on the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC).
(88)Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings (OJ L 153, 18.6.2010, p. 13).
(89)Applying to paints and varnishes, ceiling tiles, floor coverings, including associated adhesives and sealants, internal insulation and
interior surface treatments, such as those to treat damp and mould.
(90)CEN/TS 16516: 2013, Construction products – Assessment of release of dangerous substances –Determination of emissions into
indoor air.
(91)ISO 16000-3:2011, Indoor air – Part 3: Determination of formaldehyde and other carbonyl compounds in indoor air and test
chamber air – Active sampling method.
(92)The emissions thresholds for carcinogenic volatile organic compounds relate to a 28-day test period.OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
