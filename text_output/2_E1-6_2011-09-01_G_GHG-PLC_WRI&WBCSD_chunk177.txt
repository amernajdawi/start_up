company. These types of data are collected directly from
the production site, with actual areas and the mass or
volume of inputs used.  
Even with primary data from the production site, it is
unlikely that primary data is available for the measurement
of carbon stock changes and emissions from soils. In some
cases secondary data is available in peer-reviewed journals;
otherwise, common sources include:
 •Sector-specific activity data/emission factors:  These 
data are usually provided by associations, cooperatives,
and institutes representing a particular sector. It can
include aggregate activity data/emissions from site-
specific sources.
 •Country-specific activity data/emission factors:  
Information that reflects country-specific biomes,
agricultural practices, climate conditions, soil types,
vegetation groups, etc. This can be further broken
down into regional data. This type of information can
be found in national greenhouse gas inventories and
other official government publications, as well as from
country experts.  
 •Generic activity data/emission factors:  These are 
default values provided by the IPCC8, FAOSTAT9, etc.
These data refer to broad categories, such as high
activity clay soils and tropical rainforest, and usually
include carbon stock change impacts as well as land-
use change practice emissions within the default
emission factor.
Figure B.1 is a simplified illustration to show how carbon
stock information can be used to calculate land-use
change impacts. In this example, forest land is converted
into cropland, creating a 150-ton release of carbon due
to the change in carbon stock. If several carbon stock
changes occur within the assessment period, then the
overall impact of all changes must be considered.  If
