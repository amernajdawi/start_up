The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular F42.91, F71.1
or F71.20 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by
Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 10(1), point (i), of Regulation
(EU) 2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. The activity complies with one or more of the following criteria:
(a) the infrastructure is dedicated to the operation of vessels with zero direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emissions: electricity 
charging, hydrogen-based refuelling;
(b) the infrastructure is dedicated to the provision of shore-side electrical power to vessels at berth;
(c) the infrastructure is dedicated to the performance of the port’s own operations with zero direct (tailpipe) CO  2 
emissions;
(d) the infrastructure and installations are dedicated to transhipping freight between the modes: terminal infra ­
structure and superstructures for loading, unloading and transhipment of goods.
2. The infrastructure is not dedicated to the transport or storage of fossil fuels.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  At least 70 % (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and 
demolition waste (excluding naturally occurring material defined in
category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by
Decision 2000/532/EC) generated on the construction site is prepared
for reuse, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling oper ­
ations using waste to substitute other materials, in accordance with the
waste hierarchy and the EU Construction and Demolition Waste
Management Protocol (  279  ). Operators limit waste generation in processes 
related construction and demolition, in accordance with the EU
Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol and taking
into account best available techniques and using selective demolition to
enable removal and safe handling of hazardous substances and facilitate
reuse and high-quality recycling by selective removal of materials, using
available sorting systems for construction and demolition waste.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Measures are taken to reduce noise, vibration, dust and pollutant emissions 
during construction maintenance works.
