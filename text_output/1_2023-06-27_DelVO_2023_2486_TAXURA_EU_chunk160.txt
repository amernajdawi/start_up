ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 119/164(b) the area is destined to restoration or conservation in a statutory land, freshwater or maritime use plan approved by the
competent authorities;
(c) the area is the subject to a public or private contractual arrangement that can ensure that the conservation objectives
can be achieved and maintained.
5.2. The operator of the area where the conservation activity takes place commits that a new management plan or
equivalent instrument in line with the conservation objectives will be produced before the end of the previous plan.
6.Additional minimum requirements
6.1. The offsetting of the impacts of another economic activity is excluded under this activity (10). Only net biodiversity
gains resulting from conservation/restoration can be accounted for as substantial contribution under this activity (11).
6.2. The introduction of invasive alien species is prevented or their spread is managed in accordance with Regulation (EU)
No 1143/2014.
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)
(1) Climate change mitigation The activity does not involve the degradation of land with high carbon stock (12)nor the
degradation of marine environment with high carbon stock.
(2) Climate change adaptation The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.
(3) Sustainable use and protec ­
tion of water and marine
resourcesThe activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.
(4) Transition to a circular
economyN/A
(5) Pollution prevention and controlThe use of pesticides is minimised and alternative approaches or techniques, which may include non-chemical alternatives to pesticides are favoured, in accordance with
Directive 2009/128/EC, with exception of occasions where the use of pesticides is
needed to control outbreaks of pest and diseases.
The activity minimises the use of fertilisers, including manure, to ensure it does not go
beyond what is necessary to achieve the conservation and restoration objectives of the
area and complies with the Codes of Good Agricultural Practices and with the Nitrates
Action Plans in Nitrates Vulnerable Zones established in accordance with Council
Directive 91/676/EEC (
13). The activity complies with Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 or
national rules on fertilisers or soil improvers for agricultural use.
(10)Biodiversity offsets are measurable conservation outcomes resulting from measures designed to compensate for residual, unavoidable,
adverse biodiversity impacts arising from an activity or project after appropriate prevention and mitigation measures have been taken.
The goal of biodiversity offsets is to conserve the same biodiversity values (habitats, species or ecosystems) that are negatively impacted by the activity or project.
(11)This can include additional conservation/restoration outcomes beyond offsetting measures.
(12)‘Land with high-carbon stock’ means wetlands, including peatland, and continuously forested areas within the meaning of
Article 29(4)(a), (b) and (c) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.
(13)Council Directive 91/676/EEC of 12 December 1991 concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources (OJ L 375, 31.12.1991, p. 1).OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
