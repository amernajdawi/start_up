guided by the following questions, based on the “effectiveness criteria for non-judicial grievance mechanisms”, as
laid out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, in particular Principle 31. The below
considerations may be applied to individual channels or to a collective system of channels:
(a) do the channels hold legitimacy by providing appropriate accountability for their fair conduct and building stakeholder trust?
(b) are the channels known and accessible to stakeholders?
(c) do the channels have clear and known procedures, with indicative timeframes?
(d) do the channels ensure reasonable access for stakeholders to sources of information, advice and expertise?
(e) do the channels offer transparency by providing sufficient information both to complainants and, where
applicable, to meet any public interest?OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
