(5) Pollution prevention and control  For road vehicles of categories M, tyres comply with external rolling noise 
requirements in the highest populated class and with Rolling Resistance
Coefficient (influencing the vehicle energy efficiency) in the two highest
populated classes as set out in Regulation (EU) 2020/740 and as can be
verified from the European Product Registry for Energy Labelling (EPREL).
Where applicable, vehicles comply with the requirements of the most
recent applicable stage of the Euro VI heavy duty emission type-
approval set out in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 595/2009.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  N/A  
6.4.  Operation of personal mobility devices, cycle logistics  
Description of the activity  
Selling, purchasing, leasing, renting and operation of personal mobility or transport devices where the propulsion
comes from the physical activity of the user, from a zero-emissions motor, or a mix of zero-emissions motor and
physical activity. This includes the provision of freight transport services by (cargo) bicycles.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular N77.11 and
N77.21 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.
The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan,
such that:
(a) for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using
climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale;
(b) for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state-of-the-art
climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios (  464  ) consistent with the expected lifetime 
of the activity, including, at least, 10 to 30 year climate projections scenarios for major investments.
3. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and
take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line
with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports (  465  ), scientific peer-reviewed 
publications and open source (  466  ) or paying models.
