 easier to use internationally  recognized classification systems (e.g., the EUâ€™s CORINE 
system). A simplified set of land use categories is shown below.    LUC occurs when land is converted fr om one land use category to another
13; for instance,
when cropland is converted to grassland or when forests are converted to cropland. On
occasion, the same area of land might be used  to support multiple agricultural activities 
and so meet the definitions for different land-use categories. For instance, savannah
woodland might be used both to graze livesto ck and as a source of wood fuel. In such
cases, companies should categorize the land based on the agricultural activity that is economically most important .  

Land use
category Definition
Forest land An area of high concentra tion of woody biomass. Typically defined
on the basis of a minimum tree height and canopy cover. Forests lands include plantations, primary fo rests, and naturally regenerated
forests with evidence of human intervention   
Cropland Includes rice fields and agro-forestry systems.
Grassland Managed grasslands , rangelands, pasture land.
Wetland Areas of peat extraction and land that is covered or saturated by water
for all or part of the year (e.g., pe atlands) and that does not fall into
other categories.
Settlements All developed land (e.g., roads, buildings, etc.).
