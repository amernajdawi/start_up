ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 80/284Energy intensity based on net revenue (37)
40. The undertaking shall provide information on the energy intensity (total energy consumption per net revenue)
associated with activities in high climate impact sectors.
41. The disclosure on energy intensity required by paragraph 40 shall only be derived from the total energy consumption
and net revenue from activities in high climate impact sectors.
42. The undertaking shall specify the high climate impact sectors that are used to determine the energy intensity
required by paragraph 40.
43. The undertaking shall disclose the reconciliation to the relevant line item or notes in the financial statements of the net revenue amount from activities in high climate impact sectors (the denominator in the calculation of the energy
intensity required by paragraph 40).
Disclosure Requirement E1-6 – Gross Scopes 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions
44. The undertaking shall disclose in metric tonnes of CO2eq its (
38):
(a) gross Scope 1 GHG emissions;
(b) gross Scope 2 GHG emissions;
(c) gross Scope 3 GHG emissions; and
(d) total GHG emissions.
45. The objective of the Disclosure Requirement in paragraph 44 in respect of:
(a) gross Scope 1 GHG emissions as required by paragraph 44 (a) is to provide an understanding of the direct
impacts of the undertaking on climate change and the proportion of its total GHG emissions that are regulated
under emission trading schemes.
(b) gross Scope 2 GHG emissions as required by paragraph 44 (b) is to provide an understanding of the indirect
impacts on climate change caused by the undertaking’s consumed energy whether externally purchased or
acquired.
(c) gross Scope 3 GHG emissions as required by paragraph 44 (c) is to provide an understanding of the GHG
emissions that occur in the undertaking’s upstream and downstream value chain beyond its Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. For many undertakings, Scope 3 GHG emissions may be the main component of their GHG inventory
and are an important driver of the undertaking’s transition risks.
(d) total GHG emissions as required by paragraph 44 (d) is to provide an overall understanding of the undertaking’s
GHG emissions and whether they occur from its own operations or the usptream and donwstream value chain. This disclosure is a prerequisite for measuring progress towards reducing GHG emissions in accordance with the
undertaking’s climate-related targets and EU policy goals.
The information from this Disclosure Requirement is also needed to understand the undertaking’s climate-related
transition risks.
