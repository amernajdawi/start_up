4.2. In accordance with the national law, the operator of the activity commits that future updates to the
restoration plan, beyond the activity that is financed, will continue to seek the climate benefits as determined in
point 2. Besides, the operator of the activity commits to compensate any reduction in the climate benefit
determined in point 2 with an equivalent climate benefit resulting from the conduct of an activity that
corresponds to one of the environmental protection and restoration activities defined in this Regulation.
5. Audit  
Within two years after the beginning of the activity and every 10 years thereafter, the compliance of the activity
with the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation criteria and with the DNSH criteria are verified by
either of the following:
(a) the relevant national competent authorities;
(b) an independent third-party certifier, at the request of national authorities or the operator of the activity.
In order to reduce costs, audits may be performed together with any forest certification, climate certification or
other audit.
The independent third-party certifier may not have any conflict of interest with the owner or the funder, and may
not be involved in the development or operation of the activity.
6. Group assessment  
The compliance with the criteria for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and with DNSH criteria
may be checked at the level of a group of holdings sufficiently homogeneous to evaluate the risk of the
sustainability of the forest activity, provided that all those holdings have a durable relationship between them
and participate in the activity and the group of those holdings remains the same for all subsequent audits.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Peat extraction is minimised.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The use of pesticides is minimised and alternative approaches or tech ­
niques, which may include non-chemical alternatives to pesticides are
favoured, in accordance with Directive 2009/128/EC, with exception of
occasions where the use of pesticides is needed to control outbreaks of
pests and diseases.
The activity minimises the use of fertilisers and does not use manure. The
activity complies with Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 or national rules on
fertilisers or soil improvers for agricultural use.
