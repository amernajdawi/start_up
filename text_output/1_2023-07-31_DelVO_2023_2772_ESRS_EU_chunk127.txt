ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 129/284AR 8. In phase 2, to evaluate its impacts and dependencies for each priority location identified under AR 5, the
undertaking may:
(a) identify business processes and activities that lead to impacts and dependencies on environmental assets and
ecosystem services;
(b) identify water and marine resources-related impacts and dependencies across the undertaking’s value chain;
and
(c) assess the severity and likelihood of the positive and negative impacts on water and marine resources.
AR 9. For the identification of water and marine resources-related dependencies, the undertaking may rely on
international classifications such as the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES).
AR 10. When identifying its marine resources-related dependencies, the undertaking shall consider if it depends upon key
marine resources-related commodities, including but not limited to gravels and seafood products.
AR 11. Marine resources are defined according to their use by human societies and must be considered in relation to the
pressure they are subject to. Some of the pressure indicators are presented in other ESRS, namely microplastics
and emissions to water in ESRS E2 and plastic waste in ESRS E5.
AR 12. Examples of marine resources dependencies which may be considered by the undertaking are:
(a) dependencies on commercially exploited fish and shellfish in its own operations and its upstream and
downstream value chain; and
(b) fishing activity that involves mobile bottom trawling, which can also have negative impacts on the seabed.
AR 13. In Phase 3, to assess its material risks and opportunities based on the results of Phases 1 and 2, the undertaking
may :
(a) identify transition risks and opportunities in its own operations and its value chain by the categories of:
i. policy and legal: e.g., introduction of regulation or policy (e.g., changes such as increased water protection,
increased quality of water regulations, regulation of flows of water supply), ineffective governance of water
bodies or marine resources, in particular across boundaries (e.g., transboundary governance and
cooperation) resulting in water or oceans degradation, exposure to sanctions and litigation (e.g., non-
respect of permits or allocations; negligence towards or killing of threatened marine species), enhanced
reporting obligations on marine ecosystems and related services;
ii. technology: e.g., substitution of products or services by products or services with a lower impact on water
and marine resources, transition to more efficient and cleaner technologies (i.e., with lower impacts on
oceans and water), new monitoring technologies (e.g., satellite), water purification, flood protection;
iii. market: e.g., shifting supply, demand and financing, volatility or increased costs of water or marine
resources;
iv. reputation: e.g., changing societal, customer or community perceptions as a result of an organisation’s
impact on water and marine resources; and
v. contribution to systemic risks via its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain,
including the risks that a marine ecosystem collapses or the risks that a critical natural system no longer
functions (e.g., tipping points are reached, summing physical risks);
(b) identify physical risk including water quantity (water scarcity , water stress), water quality, infrastructure decay
or unavailability of some marine resources-related commodities (e.g. the rarefaction of some species of fish or
other underwater marine living organisms sold as products by the undertaking) leading for instance to the
impossibility of running operations in certain geographical areas;OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
