Application Requirements
This Appendix is an integral part of ESRS E2. It supports the application of the disclosure requirements set out in this
standard and has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard.
ESRS 2 GENERAL DISCLOSURES
Impact, risk and opportunity management
Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 IRO-1 – Description of the processes to identify and assess material
pollution-related impacts, risks and opportunities
AR 1. When conducting a materiality assessment on environmental subtopics, the undertaking shall assess the
materiality of pollution in its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain, and may consider
the four phases below, also known as the LEAP approach:
(a) Phase 1: locate where in its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain the interface with
nature takes place;
(b) Phase 2: evaluate the pollution-related dependencies and impacts;
(c) Phase 3: assess the material risks and opportunities; and
(d) Phase 4: prepare and report the results of the materiality assessment.
AR 2. The materiality assessment for ESRS E2 corresponds to the first three phases of this LEAP approach. The fourth
phase addresses the outcome of the process.
AR 3. The process to assess the materiality of impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities shall consider the
provisions in ESRS 2 IRO-1 Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities,
and IRO-2 Disclosure Requirements in ESRS covered by the undertaking’s sustainability statement.
AR 4. The sub-topics covered by the materiality assessment under ESRS E2 include:
(a) pollution of air, water and soil (excluding GHG emissions and waste), microplastics, and substances of
concern;
(b) dependencies on ecosystem services that help to mitigate pollution-related impacts.
AR 5. In Phase 1, to locate where in its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain the interface with
nature takes place, the undertaking may consider:
(a) the site locations of direct assets and operations and related upstream and downstream activities across the
value chain;
(b) the site locations where emissions of water, soil and air pollutants occur; and
(c) the sectors or business units related to those emissions or to the production, use, distribution, commercia ­
lisation and import/export of microplastics, substances of concern
, and substances of very high concern, on
their own, in mixtures or in articles.
AR 6. Phase 2 relates to the evaluation of the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies for each material site
or sector/business unit including by assessing the severity and likelihood of impacts on the environment and
human health.
AR 7. In Phase 3, to assess its material risks and opportunities based on the results of Phases 1 and 2, the undertaking
may :
(a) identify transition risks and opportunities in its own operations and its upstream and downstream value
chain by the categories of:
i. policy and legal: e.g., introduction of regulation, exposure to sanctions and litigation (e.g., negligence
towards ecosystems
), enhanced reporting obligations;OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
