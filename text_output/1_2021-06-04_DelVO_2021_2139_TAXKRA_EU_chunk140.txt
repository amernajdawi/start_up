Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  For anaerobic digestion plants treating over 100 tonnes per day, emissions 
to air and water are within or lower than the emission levels associated
with the best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set for anaerobic
treatment of waste in the latest relevant best available techniques (BAT)
conclusions, including the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for
waste treatment (  217  ). No significant cross-media effects occur. 
The produced digestate meets the requirements for fertilising materials set
out in Component Material Categories (CMC) 4 and 5 for digestate or
CMC 3 for compost, as applicable, in Annex II to Regulation (EU)
2019/1009, or national rules on fertilisers or soil improvers for
agricultural use
The Nitrogen content (with tolerance level ± 25 %) of the digestate used as
fertiliser or soil improver is communicated to the buyer or the entity in
charge of taking off the digestate.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
5.8.  Composting of bio-waste  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of dedicated facilities for the treatment of separately collected bio-waste (  218  ) through 
composting (aerobic digestion) with the resulting production and utilisation of compost.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E38.21 and
F42.99 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. The bio-waste that is composted is source segregated and collected separately.
2. The compost produced is used as fertiliser or soil improver and meets the requirements for fertilising
materials set out in Component Material Category 3 in Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 or national rules
on fertilisers or soil improvers for agricultural use.
