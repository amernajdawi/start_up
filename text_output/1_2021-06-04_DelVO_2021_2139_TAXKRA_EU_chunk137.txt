Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. The renewal of a collection system improves energy efficiency by decreasing the average energy
consumption by 20 % compared to own baseline performance averaged over three years, demonstrated on an
annual basis. That decrease of energy consumption can be accounted for at the level of the project (i.e. the
collection system renewal) or, across the downstream waste water agglomeration (i.e. including the downstream
collection system, treatment plant or discharge of waste water).
2. The renewal of a waste water treatment plant improves energy efficiency by decreasing the average energy
consumption of the system by at least 20 % compared to own baseline performance averaged over three years,
demonstrated on an annual basis.
3. For the purposes of points 1 and 2, the net energy consumption of the system is calculated in kWh per
population equivalent per annum of the waste water collected or effluent treated, taking into account measures
decreasing energy consumption relating to source control (reduction of storm water or pollutant load inputs)
and, as appropriate, energy generation within the system (such as hydraulic, solar, thermal and wind energy).
4. For the purpose of point 1 and 2, the operator demonstrates that there are no material changes relating to
external conditions, including modifications to discharge authorisation(s) or changes in load to the agglomeration
that would lead to a reduction of energy consumption, independent of efficiency measures taken.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex. Where the waste water is treated to a level suitable for reuse in
agricultural irrigation, the required risk management actions to avoid
adverse environmental impacts have been defined and implemented (  212  ). 
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Discharges to receiving waters meet the requirements laid down in 
Directive 91/271/EEC or as required by national provisions stating
maximum permissible pollutant levels from discharges to receiving waters.
Appropriate measures have been implemented to avoid and mitigate
excessive storm water overflows from the waste water collection system,
which may include nature-based solutions, separate storm water collection
systems, retention tanks and treatment of the first flush.
Sewage sludge is used in accordance with Directive 86/278/EEC or as
required by national law relating to the spreading of sludge on the soil
or any other application of sludge on and in the soil.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.

( 212  ) As set out in Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2020/741 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25May 2020 on minimum 
requirements for water reuse (OJ L 177, 5.6.2020, p. 32).EN  L 442/94 Official Journal of the European Union 9.12.2021
