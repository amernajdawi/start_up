4.22.  Production of heat/cool from geothermal energy  
Description of the activity  
Construction or operation of facilities that produce heat/cool from geothermal energy.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code D35.30 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The life-cycle GHG emissions from the generation of heat/cool from geothermal energy are lower than 100 g
CO  2 e/kWh. 
Life-cycle GHG emissions are calculated based on project-specific data, where available, using Commission
Recommendation 2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using ISO 14067:2018 or ISO 14064-1:2018.
Quantified life-cycle GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A
