ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/825/oj 3/16through the mechanis ms provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the
Council (4). The displa ying of sustainability labels remains possible without a certification sche me when such labels
are established by a public author ity, or where additional forms of expression and presentation of food are used in
accordance with Article 35 of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5).
Examples of sustainability labels established by public author ities are logos award ed when compl ying with the
requirements of Regulations (EC) No 1221/2009 (6)or (EC) No 66/2010 (7)of the European Parliament and of the
Council. Some certificat ion marks, as defined in Article 27 of Directive (EU) 2015/2436 of the European
Parliament and of the Council (8), can also operat e as sustainability labels if they promote a product, process or
business with reference, for example, to its environmental or social charact eristics or both. The trader should be
able to displa y such certification marks only if they are established by public author ities or based on a certificat ion
schem e. That rule complements Annex I, point (4), to Directive 2005/29/EC, whic h prohibits the making of a claim
that a trader , the commercial practices of a trader or a product have been approved, endorsed or author ised by a
public or private body when that is not the case, or the making of such a claim without compl ying with the term s
of the appro val, endorsement or author isation. Voluntar y market-based standards and voluntary public standards
for green and sustainable bonds do not primar ily target retail invest ors and are subject to specific laws. For those
reasons, those standards should not be considered to be sustainability labels under this Directive. It is important
that public author ities, as far as possible and in compl iance with Union law, promote measures to facilitat e access to
sustainability labels for small and medium-sized enterprises.
(8) In cases where the displa ying of a sustainability label involves a commercial communication that sugge sts or creat es
the imp ression that a product has a positive or zero impact on the environment, or is less damaging to the
environment than compe ting products, that sustainability label should also be considered as constituting an
environmental claim.
(9) Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC should also be amended to prohibit the making of a generic environmental claim
without recognised exce llent envi ronmental perf ormance whic h is relevant to the claim. Examples of gener ic
environmental claims include ‘environmentally friendly’ , ‘eco-fr iendly’, ‘green’, ‘nature ’s friend’, ‘ecological’,
‘envir onmentally correct’, ‘climate friendly’, ‘gentle on the envi ronment ’, ‘carbon friendly’ , ‘ energy efficient ’,
‘biodegradable’, ‘biobased’ or similar state ments that sugges t or creat e the impression of excellent envi ronmental
performa nce. Such gener ic environmental claims should be prohibit ed when recognised excellen t environmental
performa nce cannot be demonstrate d. Whenever the specification of the environmental claim is provid ed in clear
and prominent term s on the same medium, such as the same adver tising spot, the product’ s packag ing or online
selling interf ace, the environmental claim is not considered to be a gener ic environmental claim. For exam ple, the
claim ‘climat e-friendly packag ing’ would be a gener ic claim, whilst claiming that ‘100 % of energy used to produce
this packag ing comes from renewable sources’ would be a specifi c claim, which would not fall under this
prohibition, without prejudice to other provis ions of Directive 2005/29/EC remaining applicable to those specifi c
claims. Further more, a claim made in written form or orally combined with implicit claims such as colours or
images could constitut e a gener ic envi ronmental claim.
