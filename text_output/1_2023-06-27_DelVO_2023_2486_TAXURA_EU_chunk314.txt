Substantial contribution to protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems
1.General conditions
1.1. The activity contributes to at least one of the following:
(a) maintaining good condition of ecosystems, species, habitats or of habitats of species;
(b) re-establishing or restoring ecosystems, habitats or habitats of species towards or to good condition, including through
increasing their area or range.
1.2. The activity may be carried out by any type of operator irrespective of the main domain of activity.
2.Initial description of the area covered by the conservation activity
2.1. The activity takes place in an area with a detailed description of its initial ecological conditions which contains the
following elements:
(a) mapping of the current habitats and their condition;
(b) where applicable, the protection status of the area;
(c) characterisation of the situation of the main species in terms of conservation relevance present in the area (including
list of species, approximate size of the population, approximate size of the habitat of the species and its quality, period
during which the area is used by the species);
(d) the importance of the area to reaching good condition of species, habitats or habitats of species at regional, national or
international level as appropriate;
(e) where relevant, the potential for improving the condition of species, habitats or habitats of species present on the area or re-establishing habitats or habitats of species in the area or to enhance connectivity between habitats.
3.Management plan or equivalent instrument
3.1. The area is covered by a management plan or by an equivalent instrument, such as a restoration plan (
7), which is
regularly updated and in any case at least every ten years, and contains the following information:
(a) a description of the expected contribution of the area to the nature conservation objectives set by the competent nature
or environment authority considering the regional, national, Union and international legal and policy context;
(b) the list of species, habitats and habitats of the species that will benefit from the conservation measures (hereafter
‘targeted habitats and species’);
(c) the duration of the plan and a clear description of the conservation objectives for each targeted habitat and species and
of the corresponding conservation measures that address identified pressures and threats, including the expected
deadline for the achievement of the conservation objectives. In case the deadlines exceed the duration of the
