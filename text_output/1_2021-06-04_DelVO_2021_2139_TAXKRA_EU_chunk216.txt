2. Audit  
Within two years after the beginning of the activity and every 10 years
thereafter, the compliance of the activity with the substantial contribution
to climate change mitigation criteria and the DNSH criteria are verified by
either of the following:
(a) the relevant national competent authorities;
(b) an independent third-party certifier, at the request of national
authorities or the operator of the activity.
In order to reduce costs, audits may be performed together with any forest
certification, climate certification or other audit.
The independent third-party certifier may not have any conflict of interest
with the owner or the funder, and may not be involved in the devel ­
opment or operation of the activity.
3. Group assessment  
The compliance with the DNSH criteria may be checked:
(a) at the level of the forest sourcing area (  34 ) as defined by Directive (EU) 
2018/2001;
(b) at the level of a group of holdings sufficiently homogeneous to
evaluate the risk of the sustainability of the forest activity, provided
that all those holdings have a durable relationship between them and
participate in the activity and the group of those holdings remains the
same for all subsequent audits.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.
Detailed information referred to in point 1.2. (i) includes provisions to
comply with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  The silvicultural change induced by the activity on the area covered by the 
activity is not likely to result in a significant reduction of sustainable
supply of primary forest biomass suitable for the manufacturing of
wood products with long-term circularity potential. This criterion may
be demonstrated through the climate benefits analysis referred to in
point (2).  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The use of pesticides is reduced and alternative approaches or techniques, 
which may include non-chemical alternatives to pesticides, are favoured, in
accordance with Directive 2009/128/EC, with exception of occasions
where the use of pesticides is needed to control outbreaks of pests and
of diseases.
The activity minimises the use of fertilisers and does not use manure. The
activity complies with Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 or national rules on
fertilisers or soil improvers for agricultural use.
