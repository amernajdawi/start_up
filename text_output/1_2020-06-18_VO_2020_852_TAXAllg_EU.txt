REGUL ATION (EU) 2020/852 OF THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framew ork to facilitate sust ainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUR OPEAN UNION, Havi ng regar d to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof, Havi ng regar d to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draf t legislative act to the national parliaments, Havi ng regar d to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1), Acting in accordance with the ordinar y legislative procedure (2), Whereas: (1) Article 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union aims to establish an internal market that works for the sustainable development of Europe, based, among other things, on balanced economic growth and a high level of protection and the improvement of the quality of the environment. (2) On 25 Septembe r 2015, the UN General Assembly adopt ed a new global sustainable development framework: the 2030 Agen da for Sustainable Development (the ‘2030 Agenda’). The 2030 Agen da has at its core the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and covers the three dimensions of sustainability: economic, social and environmental. The Commission communication of 22 November 2016 on the next steps for a sustainable European future links the SDGs to the Union policy framew ork to ensure that all Union actions and policy initiatives, both within the Union and globally , take the SDGs on board at the outset. In its conclusions of 20 June 2017 the Council conf irmed the commitment of the Union and its Member States to the implementation of the 2030 Agen da in a full, coherent, compreh ensive, integra ted and effective manner , in close cooperation with partners and other stak eholders. On 11 December 2019, the Commission published its communication on ‘The European Green Deal’. (3) The Paris Agreement adopt ed under the Unit ed Nations Framew ork Convention on Climate Change (the ‘Paris Agreement ’) was approved by the Union on 5 October 2016 (3). Article 2(1)(c) of the Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the response to climate change by making finance flows consistent with a pathwa y towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climat e-resilient development, among other means. In that cont ext, on 12 December 2019, the European Council adopt ed conclusions on climat e chang e. In light thereof, this Regulation represents a key step towards the objective of achi eving a climate -neutral Union by 2050. (4) Sustainability and the transition to a safe, climat e-neutral, climate-resilient, more resource-efficient and circular econom y are crucial to ensur ing the long-t erm competiti veness of the Union econom y. Sustainability has long been central to the Union project, and the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) reflect its social and environmental dimensions.

(5) In December 2016, the Commission mandated a High-Level Exper t Group to develop an overarching and compreh ensive Union strateg y on sustainable finance. The repor t of the High-Level Exper t Group published on 31 Januar y 2018 calls for the creation of a technically robust classif ication system at Union level to establish clarity on which activities qualify as ‘green’ or ‘sustainable ’, starting with climat e chang e mitig ation. (6) In its communication of 8 March 2018, the Commission published its action plan on financing sustainable growth, launching an ambitious and compre hensive strategy on sustainable finance. One of the objectives set out in that action plan is to reor ient capital flows towards sustainable investment in order to achi eve sustainable and inclusive growth. The establishment of a unified classification system for sustainable activities is the most important and urgent action envisaged by the action plan. The action plan recognises that the shift of capital flows towards more sustainable activities has to be under pinned by a shared, holistic understanding of the environmental sustainability of activities and investments. As a first step, clear guidance on activities that qualify as contr ibuting to environmental objectives would help inform investor s about the investments that fund environmentally sustainable economic activities. Further guidance on activities that contr ibute to other sustainability objectives, including social objectives, might be developed at a later stage. (7) Given the systemic nature of global environmental challenges, there is a need for a systemic and forward-looking approach to environmental sustainability that addresses growing nega tive trends, such as climat e change, the loss of biodiversity , the global overconsump tion of resources, food scarcity , ozone depletion, ocean acidification, the deterioration of the fresh water system, and land system chang e as well as the appearance of new threats, such as hazardous chemicals and their combined effects. (8) Decision No 1386/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) calls for an increase in private sector funding for environmental and climat e-related expenditure, in particular by putting in place incentives and methodologies that stimulate companies to measure the environmental costs of their business and prof its derived from using environmental services. (9) Achieving the SDGs in the Union requires the channelling of capital flows towards sustainable investments. It is imp ortant to fully exploit the poten tial of the internal mark et to achi eve those goals. In that context, it is crucial to remo ve obstacles to the efficient movement of capital into sustainable inve stments in the internal mark et and to prevent new obstacles from emerging. (10) In view of the scale of the challenge and the costs associated with inaction or dela yed action, the financial system should be gradually adap ted in order to suppor t the sustainable functioning of the economy . To that end, sustainable finance needs to become mainstream and consideration needs to be given to the sustainability impact of financial products and services. (11) Making available financial products which pursue environmentally sustainable objectives is an effective way of channelling private investments into sustainable activities. Requirements for marketing financial products or corporate bonds as environmentally sustainable inve stments, including requirements set by Member States and the Union to allow financial mark et participants and issuers to use national labels, aim to enhance investor conf idence and aware ness of the envi ronmental impact of those financial products or corporate bonds, to create visibility and to address concer ns about ‘greenwa shing’. In the cont ext of this Regulation, greenwashin g refers to the practice of gain ing an unfair compet itive advantag e by marketing a financial product as environmentally friendly , when in fact basic environmental standards have not been met. Currently , a few Member State s have labelling schemes in place. Those existing schemes build on diffe rent classificat ion systems for envi ronmentally sustainable economic activities. Given the political commitments under the Paris Agreement and at Union level, it is likely that more and more Member States will establish labelling schemes or impose other requirements on financial market participants or issuers in respect of promoting financial products or corporate bonds as environmentally sustainable. In such cases, Member States would use their own national classification systems for the purposes of determi ning which (4)Decision No 1386/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 November 2013 on a General Union Environment Action Programme to 2020 ‘Living well, within the limits of our planet ’ (OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 171). EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 198/14 22.6.2020

inve stments qualify as sustainable. If those national labelling schem es or requirements use differ ent criteria to determine which economic activities qualify as environmentally sustainable, investors would be discourag ed from inve sting across borders due to difficulties in compari ng different investment oppor tunities. In addition, economic operat ors that wish to attract investment from across the Union would have to meet different criteria in different Member States in order for their activities to qualify as environmentally sustainable. The absence of unif orm criteria would theref ore increase costs and signif icantly disincentivise economic operators from accessing cross-border capital mark ets for the purposes of sustainable investment. (12) The criteria for deter mining whether an economic activity qualifi es as environmentally sustainable should be harmonised at Union level in order to remove barriers to the functioning of the internal market with regard to raising funds for sustainability projects, and to prevent the future emerge nce of barriers to such projects. With such harmonisation, economic operat ors would find it easier to raise funding across borders for their environmentally sustainable activities, as their economic activities could be compare d against unif orm criteria in order to be selecte d as underlying assets for environmentally sustainable inve stments. Such harmonisation would theref ore facilitate cross-border sustainable investment in the Union. (13) If financial market participants do not provi de any explanation to investors about how the activities in which they inve st contr ibute to environmental objectives, or if financia l market participants use different concepts in their explanations of what an environmentally sustainable economic activity is, inve stors will find it dispropor tionat ely burdensome to chec k and compar e different financia l products. It has been found that such practices discourag e inve stors from inve sting in envi ronmentally sustainable financia l products. Further more, a lack of investor conf idence has a major detr imental impa ct on the mark et for sustainable inve stment. It has also been shown that national rules and mark et-based initiatives taken to tackle that issue within national borders lead to the fragmentation of the internal market. If financia l market participants disclose how and to what extent the financia l products that are made available as environmentally sustainable inve st in activities that meet the criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities under this Regulation, and if financial mark et participants use common criteria for such disclosures across the Union, that would help inve stors compare investment oppor tunities across borders and would incentivise invest ee companies to make their business models more environmentally sustainable. Additionally , inve stors would inve st in environmentally sustainable financia l products across the Union with higher conf idence, thereby improving the functioning of the internal mark et. (14) To address existing obstacles to the functioning of the internal market and to prevent the emergence of such obstacles in the future, Member States and the Union should be required to use a common concept of environmentally sustainable investment when introducing requirements at national and Union level regarding financial market participants or issuers for the purpose of labelling financial products or corporat e bonds that are mark eted as envi ronmentally sustainable. To avoid market fragmentation and harm to the interests of consumers and inve stors as a result of diverging notions of environmentally sustainable economic activities, national requirements that financial mark et participants or issuers have to comply with in order to mark et financial products or corporate bonds as environmentally sustainable should build on the unif orm criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities. Such financial mark et participants and issuers include financial mark et participants that make available environmentally sustainable financial products and non-financial companies that issue environmentally sustainable corporate bonds. (15) Establishing criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities may encourage economic operat ors not covered by this Regulation, on a volun tary basis, to publish and disclose information on their website s regarding the environmentally sustainable economic activities they carry out. That information will not only help financial mark et participants and other relevant actors on the financial mark ets to easily identify which economic operat ors carry out envi ronmentally sustainable economic activities, but will also make it easier for those economic operat ors to raise funding for their environmentally sustainable activities.

(16) A classificat ion of environmentally sustainable economic activities at Union level should enable the development of future Union policies in suppor t of sustainable finance, including Union-wide standards for environmentally sustainable financia l products and the eventual establishment of labels that formally recognise compl iance with those standards across the Union. It could also serve as the basis for other economic and regulator y measures. Uniform legal requirements for determining the degree of environmental sustainability of inve stments, based on unif orm criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities, are necessar y as a reference for future Union law that aims to facilitat e the shift of investment towards environmentally sustainable economic activities. (17) In the context of achieving the SDGs in the Union, policy choices such as the creation of a European Fund for Strateg ic Investment, have been effective in contr ibuting to the channelling of private investment towards sustainable investments alongside public spending. Regulation (EU) 2015/1017 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) specifi es a 40 % climat e investment target for infrastr ucture and inno vation projects under the European Fund for Strategic Investment. Common criteria for determi ning whether economic activities qualify as sustainable, including their impact on the environment, could under pin future similar initiatives of the Union to mobilise inve stment that pursues climat e-related or other environmental objectives. (18) To avoid harming invest or interests, fund manag ers and institutional investors that make available financial products should disclose how and to what exte nt they use the criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities to determine the environmental sustainability of their investments. The information disclosed should enable invest ors to understand the propor tion of the inve stments underlying the financia l product in environmentally sustainable economic activities as a percentage of all inve stments underlying that financial product, thereb y enabling inve stors to understand the degree of environmental sustainability of the investment. Where the investments underlying the financial product are in economic activities that contr ibute to an environmental objective, the information to be disclosed should specify the environmental objective or objectives to whic h the investment underlying the financia l product contr ibutes, as well as how and to what extent the investments underlying the financia l product fund environmentally sustainable economic activities, and should include details on the respective propor tions of enabling and transitional activities. The Commission should specify the information that needs to be disclosed in that rega rd. That information should enable national compet ent author ities to easily verify compl iance with that disclosure obligation, and to enforce such compl iance in accordance with applicable national law. Where financial mark et participants do not take the criteria for envi ronmentally sustainable investments into account, they should provid e a state ment to that end. To avoid the circum vention of the disclosure obligation, that obligation should also apply where financial products are mark eted as promoting environmental charact eristics, including financial products that have as their objective environmental prot ection in a broad sense. (19) The disclosure obligations laid down in this Regulation supplement the rules on sustainability-related disclosures laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). To enhance transparency and to provid e an objective point of compari son by financial mark et participants to end inve stors on the propor tion of investments that fund environmentally sustainable economic activities, this Regulation supplements the rules on transparency in pre-contractual disclosures and in periodic repor ts laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. The definition of ‘sustainable investment’ in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 includes investments in economic activities that contr ibut e to an environmental objective whic h, amongst others, should include inve stments into ‘envi ronmentally sustainable economic activities’ within the meaning of this Regulation. Moreover , Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 only considers an investment to be a sustainable investment if it does not signif icantly harm any environmental or social objective as set out in that Regulation. (5)Regulation (EU) 2015/1017 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 June 2015 on the European Fund for Strategic Invest ments, the European Invest ment Advisor y Hub and the European Investment Project Portal and amending Regulations (EU) No 1291/2013 and (EU) No 1316/2013 – the European Fund for Strategic Invest ments (OJ L 169, 1.7.2015, p. 1). (6)Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services secto r (OJ L 317, 9.12.2019, p. 1).

(20) To ensure the reliability , consist ency and compara bility of sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector , disclosures pursuant to this Regulation should use existing sustainability indicators to the exte nt feasible as proposed by the European Parliament in its resolution of 29 May 2018 on sustainable finance (7). In that cont ext, the technical screening criteria should, to the extent feasible, be based on the sustainability indicators refer red to in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. (21) Regarding economic activities carried out by under takings that are not required to disclose information under this Regulation, there could be excep tional cases where financial mark et participants cannot reasonably obtain the relevant information to reliably determine the alignment with the technical screening criteria established pursuant to this Regulation. In such excep tional cases and only for those economic activities for which complet e, reliable and timely information could not be obtained, financial market participants should be allowed to make compl ementar y assessments and estimates on the basis of information from other sources. Such assessments and estimat es should only compe nsate for limited and specifi c parts of the desired data elements, and produce a prudent outcome. In order to ensure that the disclosure to investors is clear and not misleading, financia l mark et participants should clearly explain the basis for their conclusions as well as the reasons for having to make such compl ementar y assessments and estimat es for the purposes of disclosure to end invest ors. (22) In its communication of 20 June 2019 on ‘Guidelines on non-fi nancial repor ting: Supplement on repor ting climat e- relat ed information’, the Commission recommends that certain large compan ies repor t on certain climat e-related key performa nce indicators (KPIs) that are based on the framew ork established by this Regulation. In particular , information on the propor tion of the turnover , capital expenditure (CapEx) or operating expenditure (OpEx) of such large non-fi nancial companies that is associated with environmentally sustainable economic activities, as well as KPIs that are tailored for large financial compan ies, is useful to investors who are interested in compan ies whose products and services contr ibut e substantially to any one of the environmental objectives set out in this Regulation. It is theref ore appropr iate to require the annual publication of such KPIs by such large compan ies and to further define that requirement in delegat ed acts, in particular with regard to large financial compan ies. While it would be dispropor tionat ely burdensome to extend such a requirement to smaller companies, smaller companies may volun tarily decide to publish such information. (23) For the purpose of deter mining the environmental sustainability of a given economic activity , an exhaustive list of environmental objectives should be laid down . The six envi ronmental objectives that this Regulation should cover are: climat e chang e mitig ation; climat e change adapt ation; the sustainable use and protect ion of water and mar ine resources; the transition to a circular economy ; pollution prevention and control; and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. (24) An economic activity that pursues the environmental objective of climat e chang e mitig ation should contr ibute substantially to the stabilisation of greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding or reducing them or by enhancing greenhouse gas remo vals. The economic activity should be consist ent with the long-t erm temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. That envi ronmental objective should be interpreted in accordance with relevant Union law, including Directive 2009/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8). (25) An economic activity that pursues the environmental objective of climat e chang e adap tation should contr ibute substantially to reducing or preventing the adverse impact of the current or expect ed future climat e, or the risks of such adverse impa ct, whether on that activity itself or on people, nature or assets. That envi ronmental objective should be interpr eted in accordance with relevant Union law and the Sendai Framew ork for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030. (7)OJ C 76, 9.3.2020, p. 23.

Directive 1999/31/EC (31), Commission Regulation (EU) No 1357/2014 (32) and Commission Decisions 2000/532/EC (33) and 2014/955/EU (34), and with the communications of the Commission of 2 December 2015 on ‘Closing the loop – An EU action plan for the Circular Econom y’ and of 16 Januar y 2018 on ‘A European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy’ . (28) An economic activity can contr ibute substantially to the environmental objective of transitioning to a circular econom y in several ways. It can, for example, increase the durability , reparability , upgradability and reusability of products, or can reduce the use of resources through the design and choice of mater ials, facilitating repur posing, disassembly and deconstr uction in the buildings and constr uction sector , in particular to reduce the use of building mater ials and promote the reuse of building mat erials. It can also contr ibute substantially to the environmental objective of transitioning to a circular econom y by developing ‘product-as-a-ser vice’ business models and circular value chains, with the aim of keeping products, compo nents and mater ials at their highest utility and value for as long as possible. Any reduction in the content of hazardous substances in mat erials and products throughout the life cycle, including by replacing them with safer alternatives, should, as a minimum, be in accordance with Union law.

(31) An economic activity can contr ibut e substantially to the environmental objective of the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, in several ways, including by protecting, conser ving or restoring biodiversity and ecosystems , and thereby enhancing ecosystem services. Such services are grouped into four categor ies, namely provisionin g services, such as the provisioning of food and wate r; regulating services, such as the control of climat e and disease; suppor ting services, such as nutr ient cycles and oxygen production; and cultural services, such as provid ing spiritual and recreational benefits. (32) For the purposes of this Regulation, the term ‘sustainable forest manage ment ’ should be constr ued by taking into account practices and uses of forests and forest land that contr ibut e to enhancing biodiversity or to halting or preventing the degradation of ecosystem s, deforestation and habitat loss, by taking into account the stewardsh ip and use of forests and forest land in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity , productivity , rege neration capacity , vitality and their poten tial to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems, as set out in Resolution H1 of the Second Minist erial Conf erence on the Prote ction of Forests in Europe of 16–17 June 1993 in Helsinki on General Guidelines for the Sustainable Managem ent of Forests in Europe as well as by taking into account Regulations (EU) No 995/2010 and (EU) 2018/841 (46) of the European Parliament and of the Council and Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (47) and the communication of the Commission of 20 Sept ember 2013 on ‘A new EU Forest Strateg y: for forests and the forest-based sector ’. (33) For the purposes of this Regulation, the term ‘energy efficiency’ is used in a broad sense and should be constr ued by taking into account relevant Union law, including Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 of the European Parliament and of the Council (48) and Directives 2012/27/EU (49) and (EU) 2018/844 (50) of the European Parliament and of the Council, as well as the implementing measures adopt ed pursuant to Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (51). (34) For each environmental objective, uniform criteria for determining whether economic activities contr ibute substantially to that objective should be laid down. One element of the unif orm criteria should be to avoid signif icant harm to any of the environmental objectives set out in this Regulation. This is in order to avoid that investments qualify as envi ronmentally sustainable in cases where the economic activities benefitt ing from those investments cause harm to the environment to an extent that outweighs their contr ibution to an envi ronmental objective. Such criteria should take into account the life cycle of the products and services provided by that economic activity in addition to the envi ronmental impact of the economic activity itself, including taking into account evidence from existing life-cy cle assessments, in particular by consider ing their production, use and end of life.

(35) Recalling the joint commitment of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to pursuing the principles enshr ined in the European Pillar of Social Rights in suppor t of sustainable and inclusive growth, and recognising the relevance of internatio nal minimum human and labour rights and standards, compl iance with minimum safeg uards should be a condition for economic activities to qualify as environmentally sustainable. For that reason, economic activities should only qualify as environmentally sustainable where they are carried out in alignment with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enter prises and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including the declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the Internati onal Labour Org anisation (ILO), the eight fundamental conventions of the ILO and the Internati onal Bill of Human Rights. The fundamental convention s of the ILO define human and labour rights that under takings should respect. Several of those international standards are enshr ined the Char ter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the prohibition of slavery and forced labour and the principle of non-discr imination. Those minimum safegua rds are without prejudice to the application of more stringent requirements relat ed to the environment, health, safety and social sustainability set out in Union law, where applicable. When compl ying with those minimum safeg uards, under takings should adhere to the principle of ‘do no signif icant harm’ refer red to in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, and take into account the regulatory technical standards adopt ed pursuant to that Regulation that further specify that principle. (36) In order to ensure consist ency between this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, this Regulation should amend Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 to mandate the European Super visor y Auth orities established by Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010 (52), (EU) No 1094/2010 (53) and (EU) No 1095/2010 (54) of the European Parliament and of the Council (collectively , the ‘ESAs’) to jointly develop regulatory technical standards to further specify the details of the content and presentation of the information in relation to the principle of ‘do no significant harm’. Those regulatory technical standards should be consiste nt with the content, methodologies, and presentation of the sustainability indicators in relation to adverse impacts as referred to in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. They should also be consist ent with the principles enshr ined in the European Pillar of Social Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the eight fundamental conventions of the ILO and the International Bill of Human Rights. (37) Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 should further be amended to mandate the ESAs to develop, through the Joint Committ ee, draf t regulatory technical standards to supplement the rules on transparency of the promotion of environmental characteri stics and of environmentally sustainable investments in pre-contractual disclosures and in periodic repor ts. (38) Given the specifi c technical details needed to assess the environmental impact of an economic activity and the fast- changing nature of both science and technology , the criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities should be adapt ed regularly to reflect such changes. For the criteria to be up to date , based on scientific evidence and input from exper ts as well as relevant stak eholders, the conditions for ‘substantial contr ibution’ and ‘signifi cant harm’ should be specified with more granular ity for different economic activities and should be updat ed regularly . For that purpose, granular and calibrated technical screening criteria for the diffe rent economic activities should be established by the Commission on the basis of technical input from a multi-stakehold er platf orm on sustainable finance. (39) Some economic activities have a negative impact on the envi ronment, and reducing such negative impact can mak e a substantial contr ibution to one or more environmental objectives. For those economic activities, it is appropr iate to establish technical screening criteria that require a substantial impro vement in environmental perf ormance compare d with, inter alia, the industr y averag e, but at the same time avoid environmentally harmful lock -in effects, (52)Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 Novem ber 2010 establishing a European Super visor y Authority (European Banking Author ity), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009/78/EC (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 12).

including carbon-inten sive lock -in effects, during the economic lifetime of the funded economic activity . Those criteria should also consider the long-term impact of a specific economic activity . (40) An economic activity should not qualify as environmentally sustainable if it causes more harm to the environment than the benefits it brings. The technical screening criteria should identify the minimum requirements necessar y to avoid significant harm to other objectives, including by building on any minimum requirements laid down pursuant to Union law. When establishing and updating the technical screening criteria, the Commission should ensure that those criteria are based on available scientifi c evidence, are developed by taking into account life-cy cle considerations, including existing life-cy cle assessments, and are updat ed regularly . Where scientifi c evaluation does not allow for a risk to be determined with sufficient certainty , the precautionar y principle should apply in accordance with Article 191 TFEU. (41) In establishing and updating the technical screening criteria for the environmental objective of climat e change mitig ation, the Commission should take into account and provid e incentives for the ongoing and necessar y transition towards a climat e-neutral econom y in accordance with Article 10(2) of this Regulation. In addition to the use of climat e-neutral energy and more investments in already low-carbon economic activities and sectors, the transition requires substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in other economic activities and sectors for which there are no technologically and economically feasible low-carbon altern atives. Those transitional economic activities should qualify as contr ibuting substantially to climate change mitig ation if their greenhouse gas emissions are substantially lowe r than the sector or industr y average, they do not hamper the development and deplo yment of low-carbon alternati ves and they do not lead to a lock-in of assets incompatible with the objective of climate - neutrality , consider ing the economic lifetime of those assets. The technical screening criteria for such transitional economic activities should ensure that those transitional activities have a credible path towards climat e-neutrality , and should be adjusted according ly at regular inter vals. (42) An economic activity should qualify as contr ibuting substantially to one or more of the environmental objectives set out in this Regulation where it directly enables other activities to make a substantial contr ibution to one or more of those objectives. Such enabling activities should not lead to a lock -in of assets that under mine long-t erm environmental goals, consider ing the economic lifetime of those assets, and should have a substantial positive environmental impact, on the basis of life-cy cle considerations. (43) When establishing and updating the technical screening criteria the Commission should take into account relevant Union law, including Regulations (EC) No 1221/2009 (55) and (EC) 66/2010 (56) of the European Parliament and of the Council, as well as Commission Recommendation 2013/179/EU (57) and the communication of the Commission of 16 July 2018 on ‘Public procurement for a better envi ronment ’. To avoid unnecessar y inconsiste ncies with classifications of economic activities that already exist for other purposes, the Commission should also take into account the statistical classificat ions relating to the environmental goods and services sector, namely the classificat ion of environmental prote ction activities (CEP A) and the classification of resource manage ment activities (CReMA) of Regulation (EU) No 538/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (58). When establishing and updating the technical screening criteria, the Commission should take into account existing environmental indicator s and repor ting framew orks, developed by, amongst others, the Commission and the European Environm ent Agen cy, and existing internati onal standards, such as those developed by, amongst others, the OECD. (55)Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the voluntar y participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), repealing Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 and Commission Decisions 2001/681/EC and 2006/193/EC (OJ L 342, 22.12.2009, p. 1).

(44) When establishing and updating the technical screening criteria, the Commission should also take into account the specifi cities of the infrastr ucture sector and should take into account environmental, social and economic externalit ies within a cost-benefit analysis. In that regard, the Commission should take into account relevant Union law, including Directives 2001/42/EC (59), 2011/92/EU (60), 2014/23/EU (61), 2014/24/EU (62) and 2014/25/EU (63) of the European Parliament and of the Council, standards and current methodology , as well as the work of internati onal organisations, such as the OECD. In that cont ext, the technical screening criteria should promot e appropr iate governance frameworks integrat ing environmental, social and govern ance factors as referred to in the United Nations-suppor ted Principles for Responsible Investment at all stages of a project’s life cycle. (45) The technical screening criteria should ensure that relevant economic activities within a specifi c sector can qualify as environmentally sustainable and are treated equally if they contr ibut e equally to one or more of the environmental objectives laid down in this Regulation. The potential capacity to contr ibute to those environmental objectives can vary across sectors, which should be reflecte d in those criteria. However , within each sector, those criteria should not unfairly disadvantag e certain economic activities over others if the former contr ibut e to the environmental objectives to the same exte nt as the latter. (46) When establishing and updating technical screening criteria for environmentally sustainable activities, the Commission should assess whether the establishment of those criteria would give rise to stranded assets or would result in inconsistent incentives, or would have any other adverse impact on financia l markets. (47) To avoid overly burdensome compl iance costs on economic operat ors, the Commission should establish technical screening criteria that provid e for sufficient legal clarity, that are practicable and easy to apply , and for which compl iance can be verified within reasonable cost-of-com pliance boundar ies, thereby avoiding unnecessar y administrative burden. Techn ical screening criteria could require carrying out a life-cy cle assessment where suffi ciently practicable and where necessar y. (48) To ensure that investments are channelled towards economic activities that mak e the great est positive impact on the environmental objectives, the Commission should give priority to the establishment of technical screening criteria for the economic activities that potentially contr ibute most to the environmental objectives. (49) Appropr iate technical screening criteria should be established for the transpor t sector , including for mobile assets. Those screening criteria should take into account the fact that the transpor t sector, including internati onal shipping, contr ibut es close to 26 % of total greenhouse gas emissions in the Union. As stated in the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Gro wth the transpor t sector represents about 30 % of the additional annual investment needed for sustainable development in the Union, for example to increase electr ification or to suppor t the transition to cleaner modes of transpor t by promoting modal shift and better traffic management. (50) When developing the technical screening criteria, it is of particular imp ortance that the Commission carry out appropr iate consultations in line with the Bett er Regulation Agenda. The process for the establishment and updat e of the technical screening criteria should involve relevant stak eholders and should build on the advice of exper ts who have proven knowledg e and exper ience in the relevant areas. For that purpose, the Commission should set up a Platf orm on Sustainable Finance (the ‘Platf orm’). The Platf orm should be compo sed of exper ts representing both the public and private sectors. Public-sector exper ts should include representatives of the European Environmental (59)Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment (OJ L 197, 21.7.2001, p. 30).

Agen cy, the ESA s, the European Investment Bank and the European Union Agen cy for Fundamental Rights. Private sector exper ts should include representatives of financial and non-fi nancial mark et participants and business sector s, representing relevant industr ies, and persons with accounting and repor ting exper tise. The Platf orm should also include exper ts representing civil society , including exper ts in the field of environmental, social, labour and governance issues. Financial mark et participants should be encourage d to inform the Commission if they consider that an economic activity that does not meet the technical screening criteria, or for whic h such criteria have not yet been established, should qualify as environmentally sustainable, in order to help the Commission in evaluating the appropr iateness of compl ementing or updating the technical screening criteria. (51) The Platf orm should be constitut ed in accordance with the applicable horizontal rules on the creation and operation of Commission exper t groups, including with regard to the selection process. The selection process should aim to ensure a high level of exper tise, geographical and gender balance, as well as a balanced representation of relevant know-ho w, taking into account the specif ic tasks of the Platf orm. Dur ing the selection process, the Commission should perform an assessment in accordance with those horizontal rules to determine whether poten tial conf licts of interest exist and should take appropr iate measures to resolve any such conf licts. (52) The Platf orm should advise the Commission on the development, analysis and review of technical screening criteria, including the poten tial impact of such criteria on the valuation of assets that qualify as environmentally sustainable assets under existing mark et practices. The Platf orm should also advise the Commission on whether the technical screening criteria are suitable for use in future Union policy initiatives aimed at facilitating sustainable investment and on the possible role of sustainability accounting and repor ting standards in suppor ting the application of the technical screening criteria. The Platf orm should advise the Commission on developing further measures to imp rove data availability and quality , taking into account the objective of avoiding undue administrative burden, on addressing other sustainability objectives, including social objectives, and on the functioning of minimum safeg uards and the possible need to supplement them. (53) The Commission should continue the existing Member State Exper t Group on Sustainable Finance and provid e it with a formal status. The tasks of that exper t group will, inter alia, consist of advising the Commission on the appropr iateness of the technical screening criteria and the approach taken by the Platf orm with regar d to developing those criteria. For that purpose, the Commission should keep the Member State s informed through regular meetings of the Member State Exper t Group on Sustainable Finance. (54) In order to specify the requirements set out in this Regulation, and in particular to establish and update for diffe rent economic activities granular and calibrated technical screening criteria for what constitutes ‘substantial contr ibution’ and ‘significant harm’ to the environmental objectives, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegat ed to the Commission in respect of the information required to compl y with the disclosure oblig ations pursuant to this Regulation, and in respect of the technical screening criteria. It is of particular imp ortance that the Commission carry out appropr iate consultations during its preparatory work, including at exper t level, such as through the Platf orm and the Member State Exper t Group on Sustainable Finance, and that those consultations be conduct ed in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 Apr il 2016 on Bett er Law-Making (64). In particular , to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegat ed acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ exper ts, and their exper ts system atically have access to meetings of Commission exper t groups dealing with the preparation of delegat ed acts.

(55) This Regulation supplements the disclosure requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. To ensure the orderly and effective monit oring of compl iance by financial mark et participants with this Regulation, Member State s should rely on the compe tent author ities designat ed in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. To enforce compl iance, Member States should in addition lay down rules on measures and penalties, which should be effective, propor tionate and dissuasive. National compet ent author ities and the ESAs should exercise the product inter vention powers laid down in Regulations (EU) No 600/2014 (65), (EU) No 1286/2014 (66) and (EU) 2019/1238 (67) of the European Parliament and of the Council also with respect to mis-selling practices or misleading disclosures of sustainability-related information, including the information required under this Regulation. (56) In order to ensure the efficient and sustainable organisati on of the work and meeting practices of both the Platf orm and the Member State Exper t Group on Sustainable Finance, and in order to enable broad participation and efficient inter action within the groups, their subgroups, the Commission and stakeholders, the increased use of digital, including virtual, technologies should be considered, where appropr iate. (57) To give sufficient time to the relevant actors to familiar ise themselves with the criteria for qualif ication as environmentally sustainable economic activities set out in this Regulation and to prepare for their application, the oblig ations set out in this Regulation should become applicable, for each environmental objective, 12 months after the relevant technical screening criteria have been established. (58) The provision in this Regulation refer ring to certificate-based tax incentive schemes that exist prior to the entr y into force of this Regulation is without prejudice to the respective compet ences of the Union and the Member States with respect to tax provi sions, as set out by the Treaties. (59) The application of this Regulation should be reviewed regularly in order to assess, inter alia: the progress with regar d to the development of technical screening criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities; the possible need to revise and compl ement those criteria for deter mining whether an economic activity qualifi es as environmentally sustainable; the effectiveness of the classificat ion system for environmentally sustainable economic activities in channelling private investment into such activities and in particular as regar ds the flow of capital into private enterprises and other legal entities; and the further development of that classificat ion system, including by expanding its scope beyond environmentally sustainable economic activities, in order to cover activities that signif icantly harm the environment, as well as other sustainability objectives, including social objectives. (60) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be suffi ciently achi eved by the Member States, but can rather , by reason of the need to introduce at Union level unif orm criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities, be better achi eved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiar ity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of propor tionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessar y in order to achieve those objectives, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGUL ATION: CHA PTER I SUBJECT MA TTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS Article 1 Subject matter and scope 1.
