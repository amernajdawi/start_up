primarily process - based models intended for academic research . They have extensive requirements in terms of data inputs , labor and expertise , and would not be recommended fo r use by farm managers . They are described here because they underpin many of the more accessible resources .

Table III-1 lists the GHGs and operations covered by each tool , while Table III-2 provides
further information on each tool, such as its geographic focus and type of interface.  
Notes and Caveats
 These tools typically generate GHG flux data in  a format that is not automatically in 
conformance with this Guidance. Users will of ten therefore need to reformat these data
(e.g., to divide them by scopes) for the purpos e of developing a cor porate GHG inventory.   
 This Appendix does not attempt to provide an exhaustive list of t ools, but is merely
intended as an illustrative gui de. The tools listed here may change over time and companies
are encouraged to check the corresponding websites for updated information.
 Many different combinations of environmental and management factors will affect
agricultural GHG fluxes. For exampl e, even if a tool is rele vant to, say, ‘cropland’ or
‘livestock’ operations, as indicated in Table III-1, it may not cover the specific
combinations of interest.  
 The tools’ coverage of specialty crops and more complex livestock systems is less
comprehensive than that for commodity crops and relatively simple livestock systems.  
 The tools may employ different definitions fo r the same management practices and land
use categories. Companies should ensure that co nsistent definitions are applied when using
multiple tools for a single inventory.  
 This Appendix focuses on non-mechanical sour ces, although many of the tools listed will
also cover mechanical sources, mostly  fuel use and fertilizer production. 
 Tools for product-, project- and natio nal-level assessments are excluded.
