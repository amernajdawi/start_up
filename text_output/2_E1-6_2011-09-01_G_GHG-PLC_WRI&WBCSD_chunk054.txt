transportationIn fi gure 9.3 , the amount of fruits and vegetables the truck transports are limited by the mass of the products.
However, if the fruits and vegetables are transported by rail and the limiting factor is the volume of products, the
most appropriate allocation factor would be volume.
Figure 9.4  shows how the emissions would be allocated using a volume allocation factor.Allocating emissions from transportation is necessary 
when one or more products are transported but a
company only knows the total emissions for the transport
mode (e.g., a truck, train, aircraft, or vessel).
Transportation example
A truck transports two products: fruits and vegetables.  
There is a clear physical relationship between the two products and their emissions contributions because
the fuel use per unit of product in a transport vessel
is dependent on the mass or volume of their load. To
determine which physical allocation factor best describes
this relationship, a company should determine the
limiting factor of the transportation mode (typically mass
or volume).
