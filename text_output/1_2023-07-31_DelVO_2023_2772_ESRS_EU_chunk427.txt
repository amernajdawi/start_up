reporting year (for example, new expectations for foreign subsidiaries, new or additional approaches to due
diligence and remedy) provide contextual information for users and may disclose such explanations. This
includes policies and commitments of the undertaking to prevent or mitigate the risks and negative impacts on
people in its own workforce of reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to greener and climate-neutral
operations as well as to provide opportunities for the workforce such as job creation and upskilling, including
explicit commitments to a ‘just transition’.
AR 11. The policy may take the form of a stand-alone policy regarding the undertaking’s own workforce or be included
in a broader document such as a code of ethics or a general sustainability policy that has already been disclosed by the undertaking as part of another ESRS. In those cases, the undertaking shall provide an accurate cross-
reference to identify the aspects of the policy that satisfy the requirements of this Disclosure Requirement.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
