(e) promoting biodiversity-friendly practices that enhance forests’ natural
processes;
(f) excluding the conversion of high-biodiverse ecosystems into less
biodiverse ones;
(g) ensuring the diversity of associated habitats and species linked to the
forest;
(h) ensuring the diversity of stand structures and maintenance or
enhancing of mature stage stands and dead wood.  
2.  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND RESTORATION ACTIVITIES  
2.1.  Restoration of wetlands  
Description of the activity  
Restoration of wetlands refers to economic activities that promote a return to original conditions of wetlands and
economic activities that improve wetland functions without necessarily promoting a return to pre-disturbance
conditions, with wetlands meaning land matching international definition of wetland (  67 ) or of peatland (  68 ) as 
set out in the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat
(Ramsar Convention) (  69 ). The concerned area matches the Union definition of wetlands, as provided in the 
Commission Communication on the wise use and conservation of wetlands (  70 ). 
The economic activities in this category have no dedicated NACE code as referred to in the statistical classification
of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006, but relate to class 6 of the statistical
classification of environmental protection activities (CEPA) established by Regulation (EU) No 691/2011.  
Where an economic activity in this category complies with the substantial contribution criterion specified in
point 5, the activity is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU)
2020/852, provided that it meets the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.
