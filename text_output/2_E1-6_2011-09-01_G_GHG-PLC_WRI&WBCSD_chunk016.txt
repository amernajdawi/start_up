[22]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard
requirements
The requirements and guidance in this standard follow
the attributional approach to life cycle accounting.
The attributional approach is defined as a method in
which GHG emissions and removals are attributed to
the unit of analysis of the studied product by linking
together attributable processes along its life cycle.5
The attributional approach makes use of primary data
provided by a supplier/customer or average (secondary)
data for a given process. Explanation of the terms unit
of analysis, attributable processes, and primary data are
given in chapter 6, chapter 7, and chapter 8, respectively.
In addition to the attributional approach, another
method of life cycle accounting is the consequential
approach. The consequential approach is defined as an
approach in which processes are included in the life cycle
boundary to the extent that they are expected to change
as a consequence of a change in demand for the unit of
analysis.6  The consequential approach makes use of data 
that is not constrained and can respond to changes in
demand (e.g., marginal technology information), where
change in demand can occur as a result of changes in
production volumes, production technologies, public
policies, and consumer behaviors. Although not followed
in this standard, the consequential approach can provide
valuable insight in certain applications such as evaluating
reduction projects or making public policy decisions. Box [5.1] The consequential approach
