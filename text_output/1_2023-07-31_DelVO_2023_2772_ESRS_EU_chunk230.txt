ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 230/284AR 34. With regard to initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for affected communities
that are based on affected communities’ needs, and with regard to progress in the implementation of such
initiatives or processes, the undertaking may disclose:
(a) information about whether and how affected communities and legitimate representatives or their credible
proxies play a role in decisions regarding the design and implementation of these investments or
programmes; and
(b) information about the intended or achieved positive outcomes for affected communities of these investments
or programmes.
(c) an explanation of the approximate scope of affected communities covered by the described social investment
or development programmes, and, where applicable, the rationale for why selected communities were chosen
for a given social investment or development programme's implementation.
AR 35. The undertaking may disclose whether any initiatives or processes whose primary aim is to deliver positive impacts for affected communities are designed also to support the achievement of one or more of the UN
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, through a commitment to advance UN SDG 5 to “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls” the undertaking may be taking thoughtful measures to include
women in the consultation process with an affected community to meet standards of effective stakeholder
engagement, which can help empower the women in the process itself, but potentially also in their daily lives.
AR 36. When disclosing the intended or achieved positive outcomes of its actions for affected communities a distinction
is to be made between evidence of certain activities having occurred (for example, that x number of women community members have been provided with training on how to become local suppliers to the undertaking)
from evidence of actual outcomes for affected communities (for example, that x women community members have set up small businesses and have had their contracts with the undertaking renewed year-on-year).
AR 37. When disclosing whether initiatives or processes also play a role in mitigating material negative impacts, the
undertaking may for example consider programmes that aim to improve local infrastructure surrounding an
undertaking’s operations, such as improvements in roads leading to a reduction in the number of severe traffic
accidents involving community members.
AR 38. When disclosing the material risks and opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts or dependencies on
affected communities, the undertaking may consider the following:
(a) risks related to the undertaking’s impacts on affected communities may include the reputational or legal
exposure, as well as operational risks, where affected communities protest against resettlements or the loss of
access to lands, leading to costly delays, boycotts, or lawsuits;
(b) risks related to the undertaking’s dependencies on affected communities may include disruption of business
operations where indigenous peoples decide to withdraw their consent to a project on their lands, forcing the
undertaking to significantly modify or abandon the project;
(c) business opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts on affected communities may include more easily
financing projects and being a partner of choice for communities, governments and other businesses; and
(d) opportunities related to the undertaking’s dependencies on affected communities may include the
development of positive relationships between the undertaking and indigenous peoples that enable existing
projects to expand with strong support.
AR 39. In disclosing the information in AR 41, the undertaking may consider explanations of risks and opportunities
stemming from environmental impacts or dependencies (please refer to AR 31 for further details), including
related human rights (or social) impacts. Examples include reputational risks stemming from the impact on the health of communities of unmanaged polluting discharges; or the financial effects of protests that may disrupt or
interrupt an undertaking’s activities, for example, in response to operations in water stressed areas that may impact
the lives of affected communities.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
