3. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and
take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line
with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports (  175  ), scientific peer-reviewed 
publications and open source (  176  ) or paying models. 
4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other
people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  177  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  178  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  Greenhouse gas emissions (  179  ) from the soda ash production processes are 
lower than 0,866 (  180  ) tCO  2 e per tonne of product.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix C to this 
Annex.
Emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the latest relevant
best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including:

( 177  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta n­
eously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more
diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-eff icient
and systemic interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of
ecosystem services (version of 4.6.2021: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/nature-
based-solutions_en/).
