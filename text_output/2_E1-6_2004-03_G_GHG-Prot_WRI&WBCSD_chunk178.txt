Emissions associated with the generation of purchasedelectricity that is resold to an intermediary (e.g.,trading transactions) may be reported under optionalinformation under the category “Generation ofpurchased electricity, heat, or steam for re-sale to non-end users.” Examples of trading transactions includebrokerage/trading room transactions involving purchasedelectricity or any other transaction in which electricity ispurchased directly from one source or the spot marketand then resold to an intermediary (e.g., a non-end user).These emissions are reported under optional informationseparately from scope 3 because there could be anumber of trading transactions before the electricityfinally reaches the end-user. This may cause duplicativereporting of indirect emissions from a series of electricitytrading transactions for the same electricity.
