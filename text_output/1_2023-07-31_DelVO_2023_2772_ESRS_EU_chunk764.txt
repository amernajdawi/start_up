ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 283/284Wastewater Water which is of no further immediate value to the purpose for which it
was used or in the pursuit of which it was produced because of its quality,
quantity, or time of occurrence.
Wastewater from one user can be a potential supply to a user elsewhere.
Cooling water is not considered to be wastewater .
Water consumption The amount of water drawn into the boundaries of the undertaking (or
facility) and not discharged back to the water environment or a third party
over the course of the reporting period.
Water discharge The sum of effluents and other water leaving the boundaries of the organisation and released to surface water, groundwater , or third parties
over the course of the reporting period.
Water intensity A metric providing the relationship between a volumetric aspect of water
and a unit of activity (products, sales, etc.) created.
Water (recycled and reused) Water and wastewater (treated or untreated) that has been used more than
once before being discharged from the undertaking’s or shared facilities’ boundary, so that water demand is reduced. This may be in the same
process (recycled) or in a different process within the same facility (own or
shared with other undertakings) or in another of the undertaking’s facilities
(reused).
Water scarcity The volumetric abundance, or lack thereof, of freshwater resources. Scarcity
is human driven, it is a function of the volume of human water consumption
relative to the volume of water resources in a given area. As such, an arid region with very little water, but no human water consumption would not
be considered scarce, but rather arid. Water scarcity is a physical, objective
reality that can be measured consistently across regions and over time.
Water scarcity reflects the physical abundance of freshwater rather than
whether that water is suitable for use. For instance, a region may have abundant water resources (and thus not be considered water scarce) but
