Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  N/A  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  At least 70 % (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and demo ­
lition waste (excluding naturally occurring material referred to in category
17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by Decision
2000/532/EC) generated on the construction site is prepared for reuse,
recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling operations
using waste to substitute other materials, in accordance with the waste
hierarchy and the EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management
Protocol (  540  ). Operators limit waste generation in processes related 
construction and demolition, in accordance with the EU Construction
and Demolition Waste Management Protocol and taking into account
best available techniques and using selective demolition to enable
removal and safe handling of hazardous substances and facilitate reuse
and high-quality recycling by selective removal of materials, using
available sorting systems for construction and demolition waste.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Measures are taken to reduce noise, dust and pollutant emissions during 
construction or maintenance works.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
6.14.  Infrastructure for rail transport  
Description of the activity  
Construction, modernisation, operation and maintenance of railways and subways as well as bridges and tunnels,
stations, terminals, rail service facilities (  541  ), safety and traffic management systems including the provision of 
architectural services, engineering services, drafting services, building inspection services and surveying and
mapping services and the like as well as the performance of physical, chemical and other analytical testing of
all types of materials and products.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular F42.12, F42.13,
M71.12, M71.20, F43.21, and H52.21 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities
established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
