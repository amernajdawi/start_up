[98]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting StandardTable [12.3]  Key assurance concepts
Assurance  
conceptDescription Examples
Assertion A statement by the reporting company  
on the inventory results. The assertion is
presented to the assurer. • The studied product’s emissions
are 23 kilograms of CO2e. They are
calculated in accordance with the
Product Standard  and supplemented 
by our company-specific policies
and methodologies described in the
inventory report
Subject matter The inventory results and supporting
information included in the inventory  
report. The type of assurance performed  
will determine which subject matter(s)  
should be assessed. • Inventory results
• Other information presented in the
inventory report (See chapter 13 for
more information on reporting)
Criteria The benchmarks used to evaluate or  
measure the subject matter. • Requirements of the standard
• Methodological choices
• Data quality and uncertainty (assessed
for appropriateness for a public report)
• Others determined to be suitable by
the reporting company and assurer
Evidence Data sources and documentation used  
to calculate emissions and support the  
subject matter of the reporting company’s
assertion. Evidence should be sufficient in
quantity and appropriate in quality.• Physical observations, such as site
tours to confirm the existence and
completeness of the sources
• Assurer’s calculations
• Statements by independent parties
and/or the reporting company, such
as an interview with the production
manager about production capacity
• Documents prepared by an
independent party and/or the
reporting company, such as invoices
Assurance  
standardsStandards, used by assurers, which set
requirements on how the assurance  
process is performed.• ISO 14064-3 Specification with
Guidance for the Validation and
Verification of Greenhouse Gas
Assertions
Assurance  
opinionThe results of the assurer’s assessment
of the reporting company’s assertion (i.e.,
inventory results).  If the assurer determines 
that a conclusion cannot be expressed, the
statement should cite the reason.• See table 12.2 for examples of limited
and reasonable assurance opinionsguidance
