(a) use of circular feedstock: until 2028, at least 35 % of the packaging product by weight consists of recycled post-
consumer material for non-contact sensitive packaging and at least 10 % for contact sensitive packaging (1). From
2028, at least 65 % of the packaging product by weight consists of recycled post-consumer material for non-contact sensitive packaging and at least 50 % for contact sensitive packaging;
(b) design for reuse: the packaging product has been designed to be reusable within a reuse system (

requirements for the use of circular feedstock, as set in point 1(a) with 35 % and 10 % targets for recycled feedstock applying as of 2028 and 65 % and 50 % targets applying as of 2032. The system for reuse is established in a way that
ensures the possibility of reuse in a closed-loop or open-loop system which:
(i) provides a defined governance structure and keeps records on the number of fillings, re-uses, rejects, collection
rate, amount of reusable packaging placed on the market and units of sales or equivalent units;
(ii) provides rules on the product scope and packaging formats, as well as on the collection of reusable packaging, including incentives for consumers;
(1)‘Contact sensitive packaging’ means packaging that is intended to be used in any packaging applications in the scope of Regulation (EC)
