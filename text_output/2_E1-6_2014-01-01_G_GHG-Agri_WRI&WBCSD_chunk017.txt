wi th agricultural GHG fluxes ( e . g . , meeting the requirements of buye rs such as processors and food and drink companies , and repo rting to civil society ) .  A desire to sustain farmlands for future generations . GHG emissions reduction measures may also offer co - benefits such as :  Reduced erosion and land degradation  Reduced phosphorous ( P ) and nitrogen ( N ) runoff  Improved water quality and retention  Control of air pollutants ( e . g , ammonia and hydrogen sulphide )  Increased soil fertility

Often, these co-benefits can help to redu ce costs and increase productivity on farms.
Table 2-2 summarizes common agricultural practices that provide GHG and other
benefits. Stockwell & Bitan (2011) provide further information on these practices.  
Because agro-ecosystems are inherently complex, reduction measures should not be selected in isolation of each other, but rather selected us ing a whole-farm or systems
approach. This ensures that interactions be tween the C and nitrogen (N) cycles on farms,
as well as trade-offs between the emissions of different GHGs, are taken into account and
that reduction measures can be more effec tively integrated into  individual farming

systems (see Chapter 7.1). Because this Gu idance only considers GHGs, it cannot be used
by itself to assess trade-offs between GHGs  and other environmental impacts.

Table 2-1. Business goals served by incl uding agricultural GHG emissions in corporate inventories.
Business  Goal 
Description
Track and reduce GHG
impacts Identify emissions hot spots and reduction oppo rtunities, and prioritize GHG reduction efforts  
Set GHG reduction targets
Measure and report GHG performance over time
Develop performance benchmarks and assess performance against sector averages and competitors
Understand operational
and reputational risks and opportunities associated with agricultural GHG fluxes Identify climate-related risks (e.g., determine whether ag ricultural or processing facility would be subject to
government regulations, such as a cap and trade scheme or other reporting scheme)
Understand economic and environmental be nefits of managing emissions (see  
Table 2-2 for examples)
Enhance market opportunities (e.g., access niche markets with potential price premiums)
Guide investment and procurement decisions (e.g ., to purchase relatively less GHG-intensive goods )
Report to stakeholders Meet needs of stakeholders through public disclosure of  GHG fluxes and of progress towards GHG 
reduction targets  
Participate in voluntary re porting programs to disclose GHG related information to stakeholder groups  
Report to government reporting programs at the in ternational, national, regional or local levels
Improve reputation and accountabi lity through public disclosure
