Many products contain carbon as part of their chemical
makeup or composition. This carbon, which can be
biogenic or non-biogenic, is either recycled or reused
in another product cycle, released as CO2 or CH4 during
waste treatment (due to combustion or decomposition),
or stored as a result of waste treatment (due to land
filling or other treatments that prevent decomposition). Companies shall report when carbon contained in
a product or its components is not released to the
atmosphere during waste treatment and therefore is
considered stored. The amount of carbon stored will
depend on the waste treatment process, the scientific
understanding of the productâ€™s degradation in certain
environments, and the time period chosen. More
information on time period is available in chapter 7.
In cradle-to-gate inventories, contained carbon leaves the
boundary of the inventory as part of the intermediate
product. For intermediate product cradle-to-gate inventory
results to be useful to a downstream customer doing a final
product cradle-to-grave inventory, companies shall report
the amount of carbon contained in the product leaving the
boundary (e.g., gate). Companies may include additional
information about the end-of-life properties of an
intermediate product separate from the inventory results.
