4. The topic of water and marine resources is closely connected to other environmental sub- topics such as climate
change, pollution
, biodiversity and circular economy. Thus, to provide a comprehensive overview of what could be
material to water and marine resources, relevant Disclosure Requirements are covered in other environmental ESRS
as follows:
(a) ESRS E1 Climate change, which addresses, in particular, acute and chronic physical risks which arise from water
and ocean-related hazards caused or exacerbated by climate change, including increasing water temperature,
changing precipitation patterns and types (rain, hail, snow/ice), precipitation or hydrological variability, ocean
acidification, saline intrusion, sea level rise, drought, high water stress, heavy precipitation, flood and glacial lake
outbursts;
(b) ESRS E2 Pollution, which addresses, in particular, the emissions to water, which includes emissions to oceans, and
the use and generation of microplastics;
(c) ESRS E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems, which addresses, in particular, the conservation and sustainable use of and
impact on freshwater aquatic ecosystems as well as the oceans and seas; and
(d) ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy which addresses in particular waste management including plastic, and
the transition towards the extraction of non-renewable resources of wastewater ; reduced use of plastic; and the
recycling of wastewater.
5. The undertaking’s impacts on water and marine resources affect people and communities. Material negative impacts
on affected communities from water and marine resources-related impacts attributable to the undertaking are
covered in ESRS S3 Affected communities.
6. This Standard should be read in conjunction with ESRS 1 General requirements and ESRS 2 General disclosures .
Disclosure requirements
ESRS 2 General disclosures
7. The requirements of this section should be read in conjunction with and reported alongside the disclosures required
by ESRS 2 chapter 4 Impact, risk and opportunity management.
Impact, risk and opportunity management
Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 IRO-1 – Description of the processes to identify and assess material water
and marine resources-related impacts, risks and opportunities
8. The undertaking shall describe the process to identify material impacts, risks and opportunities and shall provide
information on:
(a) whether and how the undertaking it has screened its assets and activities in order to identify its actual and
potential water and marine resources-related impacts, risks and opportunities in its own operations and its
upstream and downstream value chain, and if so the methodologies, assumptions and tools used in the
screening;
(b) whether and how it has conducted consultations, in particular, with affected communities (64).
