DIRECTIVES DIRECTIVE (EU) 2022/2464 OF THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 14 December 2022 amending Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directiv e 2004/109/EC, Directiv e 2006/43/EC and Directiv e 2013/34/EU, as regards corporate sust ainability repor ting (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUR OPEAN UNION, Havi ng regar d to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 50 and 114 thereof, Havi ng regar d to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draf t legislative act to the national parliaments, Havi ng regar d to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1), Acting in accordance with the ordinar y legislative procedure (2), Whereas: (1) In its communication of 11 December 2019 entitled ‘The European Green Deal’ (the ‘Green Deal’), the European Commission made a commitment to review the provisions concer ning non-fi nancial repor ting of Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). The Green Deal is the new growth strategy of the Union. It aims to transf orm the Union into a moder n, resource-efficient and competitive econom y with no net emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) by 2050. It also aims to prote ct, conser ve and enhance the Union's natural capital, and prote ct the health and well-being of Union citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. The Green Deal aims to decouple economic growth from resource use, and ensure that all regions and Union citizens participate in a socially just transition to a sustainable economic syste m whereby no person and no place is left behind. It will contr ibut e to the objective of building an economy that works for the people, strengthening the Union’s social market economy , helping to ensure that it is ready for the future and that it delivers stability , jobs, growth and sustainable investment. These goals are especially important consider ing the socio-economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for a sustainable, inclusive and fair reco very. Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4)makes the objective of climat e neutrality by 2050 binding in the Union. Moreover , in its Communication of 20 May 2020 entitled ‘EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030: Bringing nature back into our lives’, the Commission commits to ensur ing that by 2050 all of the world’s ecosystem s are restored, resilient and adequately prot ected. That strategy aims to put Europe’s biodiversity on a path to recovery by 2030. (1)OJ C 517, 22.12.2021, p. 51.

(2) In its Communication of 8 March 2018 entitled ‘Action Plan: Financing Sustainable Growth’ (the ‘Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Gro wth’), the Commission set out measures to achi eve the following objectives: reor ient capital flows towards sustainable investment in order to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth, manage financial risks stemming from climat e chang e, resource depletion, environmental degradation and social issues, and foster transparency and long-t ermism in financial and economic activity . The disclosure by certain catego ries of under takings of relevant, comparab le and reliable sustainability information is a prerequisite for meeting those objectives. The European Parliament and the Council have adop ted a number of legislative acts as part of the imp lementation of the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growt h. Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5)govern s how financial mark et participants and financial advisers are to disclose sustainability information to end invest ors and asset owners. Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6)creat es a classif ication system of environmentally sustainable economic activities with the aim of scaling up sustainable investments and combatting greenwashing of financial products that unduly claim to be sustainable. Regulation (EU) 2019/2089 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), compl emented by Commission Delegat ed Regulations (EU) 2020/1816 (8), (EU) 2020/1817 (9)and (EU) 2020/1818 (10), introduces environmental, social and governance (‘ESG’) disclosure requirements for benc hmark administrators and minimum standards for the constr uction of EU Climate Transition Benc hmark s and EU Paris-aligned Benc hmark s. Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11)requires large institutions which have issued secur ities that are admitt ed to trading on a regulated mark et to disclose information on ESG risks from 28 June 2022 . The prudential framework for investment firms established by Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12)and Directive (EU) 2019/2034 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13)contains provisions concer ning the introduction of an ESG risk dimension in the Super visor y Review and Evaluation Process (‘SREP’) by compet ent author ities, and contains ESG risk disclosure requirements for inve stment firms, applicable from 26 December 2022 . On 6 July 2021 , the Commission also adopt ed a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on European green bonds, following up on the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Gro wth. (5)Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services secto r (OJ L 317, 9.12.2019, p. 1). (6)Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framewo rk to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (OJ L 198, 22.6.2020, p. 13). (7)Regulation (EU) 2019/2089 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 amending Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 as regar ds EU Climate Transition Benchmarks, EU Paris-aligned Benchma rks and sustainability-related disclosures for benc hmark s (OJ L 317, 9.12.2019, p. 17). (8)Commission Delegat ed Regulation (EU) 2020/1816 of 17 July 2020 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regar ds the explanation in the benchmark statement of how environmental, social and govern ance factors are reflected in each benchm ark provided and published (OJ L 406, 3.12.2020, p. 1). (9)Commission Delegat ed Regulation (EU) 2020/1817 of 17 July 2020 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regar ds the minimum content of the explanation on how environment al, social and governance factors are reflected in the benchmark methodology (OJ L 406, 3.12.2020, p. 12). (10)Commission Delegat ed Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 of 17 July 2020 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regar ds minimum standards for EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks (OJ L 406, 3.12.2020, p. 17).

(3) In its Communication of 17 June 2019 entitled ‘Guidelines on non-f inancial repor ting: Supplement on repor ting climat e-related information’ (‘Guidelines on repor ting climat e-relat ed information’), the Commission highlighted the benefits for companies of repor ting on climate-relat ed information particularly by increasing awareness and understanding of climate -related risks and oppor tunities within the compan y, diversifying the inve stor base, creating a lower cost of capital and impro ving constr uctive dialogue with all stakeho lders. Further more, diversity on compan y boards might have an influence on decision-making, corporate governance and resilience. (4) In its conclusions of 5 December 2019 on the deepening of the Capital Mark ets Union, the Council stressed the imp ortance of reliable, comparable and relevant information on sustainability risks, oppor tunities and impacts, and called on the Commission to consider the development of a European non-fi nancial repor ting standard. (5) In its resolution of 29 May 2018 on sustainable finance (14), the European Parliament called for the further development of non-financial repor ting requirements in the framework of Directive 2013/34/EU. In its resolution of 17 December 2020 on sustainable corporate governance (15), the European Parliament welcomed the Commission’s commitment to review Directive 2013/34/EU and expressed the need to set up a compreh ensive Union framework on non-fi nancial repor ting that contains mandatory Union non-fi nancial repor ting standards. The European Parliament called for the expansion of the scope of the repor ting requirements to additional catego ries of under takings and for the introduction of an audit requirement. (6) In its resolution of 25 Sept ember 2015 entitled ‘Transf orming our world: the 2030 Agen da for Sustainable Development’ (the ‘2030 Agen da’) the Unit ed Nations (UN) General Assembly adopt ed a new global sustainable development framew ork. The 2030 Agen da has at its core the UN Sustainable Development Goals (‘SDGs’ ) and covers the three dimensions of sustainability : economic, social and environmental. The Commission Communication of 22 November 2016 entitled ‘Next steps for a sustainable European future: European action for sustainability’ linked the SDGs to the Union policy framew ork to ensure that all Union actions and policy initiatives, both within and outside the Union, take those goals on board at the outset. In its conclusions of 20 June 2017 on ‘A sustainable European future: The EU response to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, the Council conf irmed the commitment of the Union and its Member States to the implementation of the 2030 Agen da in a full, coherent, comprehensive, integrat ed and effective manner , in close cooperation with partners and other stake holders. (7) Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (16)amended Directive 2013/34/EU as regards disclosure of non-fi nancial information by certain large under takings and groups. Directive 2014/95/EU introduced a requirement on under takings to repor t information on, as a minimum, environmental, social and emplo yee matte rs, respect for human rights, anti-cor ruption and briber y matters. With regard to those topics, Directive 2014/95/EU required under takings to disclose information under the followi ng repor ting areas: business model; policies, including due diligence processes; the outcome of those policies; risks and risk management; and key performa nce indicator s relevant to the business. (8) Many stak eholders consider the term ‘non-financial’ to be inaccurate , in particular because it implies that the information in question has no financia l relevance. Increasing ly, however , such information does have financial relevance. Many organisations, initiatives and practitioners in the field of sustainability repor ting refer to ‘sustainability information’. It is theref ore preferable to use the term ‘sustainability information’ in place of ‘non- financial information’. Directive 2013/34/EU should theref ore be amended to take account of that chang e in term inology . (14)OJ C 76, 9.3.2020, p. 23. (15)OJ C 445, 29.10.2021, p. 94. (16)Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 amending Directive 2013/34/EU as regards disclosure of non-fi nancial and diversity information by certain large under takings and groups (OJ L 330, 15.11.2014, p. 1).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 16.12.2022 L 322/17

(9) If under takings carried out better sustainability repor ting, the ultimate beneficiar ies would be individual citizens and savers, including trade unions and worke rs’ representatives who would be adequate ly informed and theref ore able to bette r engag e in social dialogue. Savers who want to inve st sustainably will have the oppor tunity to do so, while all citizens would benefi t from a stable, sustainable and inclusive economic system . To realise such benefits, the sustainability information disclosed in the annual repor ts of under takings first has to reach two primar y groups of users. The first group of users consists of invest ors, including asset managers, who want to bette r understand the risks and oppor tunities that sustainability issues pose for their investments and the impact s of those investments on people and the environment. The second group of users consists of civil society actors , including non-go vernmental organisations and social partners, which wish to better hold under takings to account for their impacts on people and the environment. Other stak eholders might also make use of sustainability information disclosed in annual repor ts, in particular to foster comparab ility across and within mark et sectors . The business partners of under takings, including custome rs, might rely on sustainability information to understand and, where necessar y, repor t on their sustainability risks and impacts throughout their own value chains. Policy make rs and environmental agencies can use such information, in particular on an aggreg ate basis, to monitor environmental and social trends, to contr ibut e to environmental accounts, and to inform public policy . Few individual citizens and consumers directly consult under takings’ annual repor ts, but they might use sustainability information indirectly , for exam ple, when consider ing the advice or opinions of financial advisers or non- governmental orga nisations. Many inve stors and asset managers purchase sustainability information from third- party data providers, who collect information from various sources, including public corporat e repor ts. (10) The mark et for sustainability information is rapidly growing, and the role of third-par ty data provid ers is gainin g in imp ortance given the new oblig ations that inve stors and asset manage rs need to fulfil. With the increased availability of disaggregat ed data, sustainability information should come at a more reasonable cost. The amendments to Directive 2013/34/EU provided for in this amending Directive are expecte d to increase the comparability of data and harmonise standards. It is expecte d that the practices of third-par ty data providers will impro ve and that exper tise will grow in this area, with a poten tial for job creation. (11) There has been a very significant increase in demand for corporate sustainability information in recent years, especially on the part of the inve stment community . That increase in demand is driven by the changing nature of risks to under takings and growing invest or awar eness of the financia l imp lications of those risks. That is especially the case for climat e-related financial risks. There is also growing awar eness of the risks and oppor tunities for under takings and for investments resulting from other environmental issues, such as biodiversity loss, and from health and social issues, including child labour and forced labour . The increase in demand for sustainability information is also driven by the growth in investment products that explicitly seek to meet certain sustainability standards or achi eve certain sustainability objectives and to ensure coherence with the ambition of the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framew ork Conv ention on Climate Change adopt ed on 12 December 2015 (the ‘Pari s Agreement ’), the UN Conv ention on Biological Diversity and Union policies. Part of that increase is the logical consequence of previously adopt ed Union legislation, notably Regulations (EU) 2019/2088 and (EU) 2020/852. Some of that increase would have happened in any case, due to fast-changing citizen aware ness, consumer preferences and mark et practices. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerat ed the increase in users’ information needs, in particular as it has exposed the vulnerabilities of work ers and under takings’ value chains. Information on environmental impacts is also relevant in the context of mitigating future pandemics, with human disturbance of ecosystems being increasing ly linked to the occur rence and spread of diseases. (12) Under takings themselves stand to benefit from carrying out high-quality repor ting on sustainability matt ers. The growth in the number of investment products that aim to pursue sustainability objectives means that good sustainability repor ting can enhance an under taking’s access to financial capital. Sustainability repor ting can help under takings to identify and manag e their own risks and oppor tunities relat ed to sustainability matt ers. It can provid e a basis for better dialogue and communication between under takings and their stakeholders, and can help under takings to impro ve their reputation. Moreover , a consistent basis for sustainability repor ting in the form of sustainability repor ting standards would lead to relevant and sufficient information being provi ded and thus signif icantly decrease ad hoc requests for information.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 322/18 16.12.2022

(13) The Commission repor t of 21 Apr il 2021 on the review clauses in Directives 2013/34/EU, 2014/95/EU, and 2013/50/EU and its accompan ying fitness check on the EU framewor k for public repor ting by companies (‘Commission repor t on the review clauses and its accompan ying fitness check’) identified problems as to the effectiveness of Directive 2014/95/EU. There is signif icant evidence that many under takings do not disclose mater ial information on all major sustainability-related topics, including climate -related information such as all GHG emissions, and factors that affect biodiversity . The repor t also identif ied the limited compar ability and reliability of sustainability information as signif icant problems. Additionally , man y under takings from which users need sustainability information are not oblig ed to repor t such information. According ly, there is a clear need for a robust and affordable repor ting framework that is accompanied by effective auditing practices to ensure the reliability of data and avoid greenwashing and double counting. (14) In the absence of policy action, the gap between users’ information needs and the sustainability information provid ed by under takings is expect ed to grow . That gap has signif icant nega tive consequences. Invest ors are unable to take sufficient account of sustainability-relate d risks and oppor tunities in their investment decisions. The aggregation of multiple investment decisions that do not take adequate account of sustainability-related risks has the poten tial to creat e system ic risks that threaten financial stability . The European Central Bank (ECB) and internati onal organisations, such as the Financial Stability Board, have drawn attention to those systemic risks, in particular as regards climat e. Invest ors are also less able to channel financial resources to under takings and economic activities that address and do not exacerbate social and environmental problems, which under mines the objectives of the Green Deal, the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth and the Paris Agreement. Non- governmental organisations, social partners, communities affect ed by under takings’ activities, and other stake holders are less able to hold under takings accountable for their impa cts on people and the environment. This creat es an accountability deficit and could lead to lower levels of citizen trust in businesses, which in turn could have negativ e impa cts on the efficient functioning of the social mark et econom y. The lack of generally accept ed metr ics and methods for measur ing, valuing, and managing sustainability-related risks is also an obstacle to the efforts of under takings to ensure that their business models and activities are sustainable. The lack of sustainability information provi ded by under takings also limits the ability of stake holders, including civil society actors, trade unions and worke rs’ representatives, to enter into dialogue with under takings on sustainability matt ers. (15) The Commission repor t on the review clauses and its accompan ying fitness check also identified a signif icant increase in requests to under takings for information about sustainability matte rs aimed at addressing the existing information gap between users’ information needs and the available corporate sustainability information. In addition, ongoing expectations on under takings to use a variety of diffe rent framew orks and standards are likely to continue and may even intensify as the value placed on sustainability information continues to grow. In the absence of policy action to build consensus on the information that under takings should repor t, there will be signif icant increases in term s of cost and burden for repor ting under takings and for users of such information. (16) The existing information gap makes it more likely that individual Member States will introduce increasing ly diverg ent national rules or standards. Different repor ting requirements in differ ent Member State s could create additional costs and compl exity for under takings operating across borders and theref ore under mine the internal mark et, and could under mine the right of establishment and the free mov ement of capital across the Union. Such differ ent repor ting requirements could also mak e repor ted information less comparable across borders, under mining the capital mark ets union. (17) Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU apply to large under takings that are public-interest entities with an average number of emplo yees in excess of 500, and to public-interest entities that are parent under takings of a large group with an average number of emplo yees in excess of 500 on a consolidate d basis, respectively . In view of the growth of users’ needs for sustainability information, additional catego ries of under takings should be required to repor t sustainability information. It is theref ore appropr iate to require all large under takings and all under takings, excep t micro under takings, whose secur ities are admitte d to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union to repor t sustainability information. The provisions of this amending Directive amending Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU explicitly set out the scope of the repor ting requirements with reference to Articles 2 and 3 of Directive 2013/34/EU. Theref ore, they do not simplify or modify another requirement and the restr iction of exem ptions for public-inte rest entities provided for in Article 40 of Directive 2013/34/EU does not apply . In particular , public- inter est entities should not be treated as large under takings for the purposes of the application of the sustainability EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 16.12.2022 L 322/19 

--- Page 6 of 66 ---

repor ting requirements. According ly, small and medium-sized under takings whose secur ities are admitt ed to trading on a regulated market in the Union that are public-inte rest entities should be allowed to repor t in accordance with the sustainability repor ting standards for small and medium-sized under takings. In addition, all under takings that are parent under takings of large groups should prepare sustainability repor ting at group level. Moreover , since Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 refers to Article 19a and Article 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU, the under takings added to the scope of the sustainability repor ting requirements will also have to compl y with Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852. (18) The requirement provided for in this amending Directive that also large under takings whose secur ities are not admitte d to trading on a regulate d market in the Union should disclose information on sustainability matters is mainly justified by concer ns about the impacts and accountability of such under takings, including through their value chain. In this respect, all large under takings should be subject to the same requirements to repor t sustainability information publicly . In addition, financial mark et participants also need information from those large under takings whose secur ities are not admitte d to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union. (19) The requirement provid ed for in this amending Directive that third-countr y under takings whose secur ities are admitte d to trading on a regulate d market in the Union should also disclose information on sustainability matt ers is aimed at responding to the needs of financial mark et participants for information from such under takings in order to enable them to understand the risks and impacts of their investments and to compl y with the disclosure requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. (20) Third-countr y under takings whic h have a signif icant activity on the territory of the Union should also be required to provid e sustainability information, especially on their impa cts on social and environmental matt ers, in order to ensure that third-countr y under takings are accountable for their impacts on people and the environment and that there is a level playing field for compan ies operating in the internal market. Theref ore, third-countr y under takings which generate a net turnover of more than EUR 150 million in the Union and which have a subsidiar y under taking or a branch on the territory of the Union should be subject to Union sustainability repor ting requirements. To ensure the propor tionality and enforceability of such requirements, the threshold of having a net turnover of more than EUR 40 million should apply to the branch es of third-countr y under takings, and the thresholds relat ed to being considered a large under taking or a small or medium-sized under taking, excep t micro under takings, whose secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union should apply to the subsidiar y under takings of third-countr y under takings, as such subsidiar y under takings and branche s should be responsible for publishing the sustainability repor t of the third-countr y under taking. The sustainability repor ts published by the subsidiar y under taking or branch of a third-countr y under taking should be prepared in accordance with standards to be adopt ed by 30 June 2024 by the Commission through delegat ed acts. The subsidiar y under taking or branch of a third-countr y under taking should also be able to repor t in accordance with the standards applying to under takings established in the Union, or in accordance with standards which are deemed equivalent pursuant to an imp lementing act. In the event that not all the information required under this amending Directive is provid ed by the third-countr y under taking, despite the best efforts of the subsidiar y under taking or branch of that third-countr y under taking to obtain the necessar y information, that subsidiar y under taking or branch should provid e all the information in its possession and issue a statement indicating that the third-countr y under taking did not mak e the rest of the required information available. In order to ensure the quality and reliability of the repor ting, the sustainability repor ts of third-countr y under takings should be published accompan ied by an assurance opinion expressed by a person or firm author ised to give an opinion on the assurance of sustainability repor ting, either under the national law of the third-countr y under taking or of a Member State. In the event that such an assurance opinion is not provided, the subsidiar y under taking or branch of the third-countr y under taking should issue a statement indicating that the third-countr y under taking did not provid e the necessar y assurance opinion. The sustainability repor t should be made accessible free of charge to the public through the central, commercial or compan ies registers of the Member States, or altern atively on the website of the subsidiar y under taking or the branch of the third-countr y under taking.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 322/20 16.12.2022 

--- Page 7 of 66 ---

Member States should be able to inform the Commission on an annual basis of the subsidiar y under takings or branches of the third-countr y under takings that fulfilled the publication requirement and of the cases where a repor t was published but the subsidiar y under taking or branch of the third-countr y under taking has state d that it could not get the necessar y information from the third-countr y under taking. The Commission should make publicly available on its website a list of the third-countr y under takings that have published a sustainability repor t. (21) Consider ing the growing relevance of sustainability-related risks and taking into account that small and medium- sized under takings whose secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulate d mark et in the Union compr ise a signif icant propor tion of all under takings whose secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulate d mark et in the Union, in order to ensure investor prot ection, it is appropr iate to require that also small and medium-sized under takings, excep t micro under takings, whose secur ities are admitte d to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union disclose information on sustainability matt ers. The introduction of such a requirement will help to ensure that financial mark et participants can include smaller under takings whose secur ities are admitt ed to trading on a regulated market in the Union in investment portfolios, on the basis that they repor t the sustainability information that financia l market participants need. It will theref ore help to prot ect and enhance the access of smaller under takings whose secur ities are admitte d to trading on a regulate d mark et in the Union to financia l capital, and avoid discr imination against such under takings on the part of financia l market participants. The introduction of the requirement for small and medium-sized under takings, excep t micro under takings, whose secur ities are admitte d to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union to disclose information on sustainability matte rs is also necessar y to ensure that financial market participants have the information they need from investee under takings to be able to compl y with their own sustainability disclosure requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. Small and medium-sized under takings whose secur ities are admitt ed to trading on a regulated market in the Union should be given the possibility of repor ting in accordance with standards that are propor tionat e to their capacities and resources, and relevant to the scale and compl exity of their activities. Small and medium-sized under takings whose secur ities are not admitt ed to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union should also have the possibility of choosing to use such propor tionat e standards on a voluntar y basis. The sustainability repor ting standards for small and medium-sized under takings will constitute a referen ce for under takings that are within the scope of the requirements introduced by this amending Directive regar ding the level of sustainability information that they could reasonably request from small and medium-sized under takings that are suppliers or clients in the value chains of such under takings. Small and medium-sized under takings whose secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union should, in addition, be given sufficient time to prepare for the application of the provisions requir ing sustainability repor ting, due to their smaller size and more limited resources, and taking account of the difficult economic circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Theref ore, the provisions on corporat e sustainability repor ting as regards small and medium-sized under takings, excep t micro under takings, whose secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulate d market in the Union should apply for financia l years starting on or after 1 Januar y 2026 . Follo wing that date, for a transitional period of two years, small and medium-sized under takings whose secur ities are admitte d to trading on a regulated market in the Union should have the possibility of opting-out from the sustainability repor ting requirements laid down in this amending Directive, provi ded they briefly state in their management repor t why the sustainability information has not been provi ded. (22) Member States should be free to assess the impact of their national transposition measures on small and medium- sized under takings, in order to ensure that they are not dispropor tionately affected, with specific attention to be given to micro-under takings and to avoiding an unnecessar y administrative burden. Member States should consider introducing measures to suppor t small and medium-sized under takings in applying the sustainability repor ting standards.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 16.12.2022 L 322/21

(23) Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (17)applies to under takings whose secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union. In order to ensure that under takings whose secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union, including third-countr y issuers, fall under the same sustainability repor ting requirements, Directive 2004/109/EC should contain the necessar y cross-ref erences to any requirement on sustainability repor ting in the annual financial repor t. (24) Point (i) of the first subparagraph of Article 23(4) and the fourth subparagraph of Article 23(4) of Directive 2004/109/EC empo wer the Commission to adop t measures to set up a mechanism for the determination of equivalence of information required under that Directive, and for the establishment of general equivalence criteria regarding accounting standards, respectively . The third subparagraph of Article 23(4) of Directive 2004/109/EC also empo wers the Commission to take the necessar y decisions on the equivalence of accounting standards whic h are used by third-countr y issuers. In order to reflect the inclusion of the sustainability requirements in Directive 2004/109/EC, the Commission should be empowered to establish a mec hanism for the deter mination of equivalence of sustainability repor ting standards applied by third-countr y issuers, similar to what is provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1569/2007 (18)whic h sets out the criteria for the determination of equivalence of accounting standards applied by third-countr y issuers. For the same reason, the Commission should also be empo wered to take the necessar y decisions on the equivalence of sustainability repor ting standards that are used by third-countr y issuers. The amendments introduced by this amending Directive will ensure consistent equivalence regimes for sustainability repor ting requirements and for financial repor ting requirements regar ding the annual financial repor t. (25) Article 19a(3) and Article 29a(3) of Directive 2013/34/EU exem pt all subsidiar y under takings from the obligation to repor t non-fi nancial information where such under takings and their subsidiar y under takings are included in the consolidated manag ement repor t of their parent under taking, provid ed that repor t includes non-fi nancial information repor ted pursuant to that Directive. It is necessar y, however , to ensure that sustainability information is easily accessible for users, and to ensure that there is transparency as regar ds which parent under taking of the exem pted subsidiar y under taking is repor ting at group level. It is theref ore necessar y to require those subsidiar y under takings to include in their managemen t repor t the name and register ed office of the parent under taking that is repor ting sustainability information at group level, the weblink s to the consolidated manage ment repor t of their parent under taking and a reference in their manag ement repor t to the fact that they are exem pted from sustainability repor ting. Member States should be able to require that the parent under taking publish the consolidated manag ement repor t in the languag es they accept and that the parent under taking provid e any necessar y translation in such language s. Such exem ption should also apply where the parent under taking repor ting at group level is a third-countr y under taking repor ting sustainability information in accordance with equivalent sustainability repor ting standards. Directive 2004/109/EC, as amended by this amending Directive, should provide for appropr iate mec hanisms to determine the equivalence of sustainability repor ting standards, and under takings whose secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union and under takings whose secur ities are not admitted to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union should be required to repor t in accordance with the same sustainability repor ting standards. In this context, the implementing acts adopt ed by the Commission pursuant to point (i) of the first subparagraph of Article 23(4) and the fourth subparagraph of Article 23(4) of Directive 2004/109/EC establishing a mechani sm for the determination of equivalence of standards should be used to determine whether to exem pt subsidiar y under takings of third-countr y parent under takings under the regime of Directive 2013/34/EU. Theref ore, the subsidiar y under taking should be exem pted when the consolidate d sustainability repor ting is carried out in accordance with the sustainability repor ting standards adopt ed by the Commission pursuant to Article 29b of Directive 2013/34/EU introduced by this amending Directive or in a manner equivalent to those sustainability repor ting standards, as determined in accordance with an implementing act on the equivalence of sustainability (17)Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulated market and amending Directive 2001/34/EC (OJ L 390, 31.12.2004, p. 38). (18)Commission Regulation (EC) No 1569/2007 of 21 December 2007 establishing a mechanism for the determination of equivalence of accounting standards applied by third countr y issuers of secur ities pursuant to Directives 2003/71/EC and 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 340, 22.12.2007, p. 66).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 322/22 16.12.2022

repor ting standards adopt ed pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 23(4) of Directive 2004/109/EC. Such exem ption should not apply to large under takings whose secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union for reasons of investor prote ction, in order to ensure great er transparency as regards such under takings. (26) Article 23 of Directive 2013/34/EU exem pts parent under takings from the oblig ation to prepare consolidat ed financial statements and a consolidated management repor t where parent under takings are subsidiar y under takings of another parent under taking that compl ies with that obligation. It should be specifi ed, however , that the exem ption regime for consolidated financia l statements and consolidated management repor ts operat es independently from the exem ption regime for consolidated sustainability repor ting. An under taking can theref ore be exem pted from consolidated financial repor ting requirements but not from consolidated sustainability repor ting requirements where its ultimat e parent under taking prepares consolidated financial state ments and consolidat ed manage ment repor ts in accordance with Union law, or in accordance with equivalent requirements if the under taking is established in a third countr y, but does not carry out consolidated sustainability repor ting in accordance with Union law, or in accordance with equivalent requirements if the under taking is established in a third countr y. It is necessar y that parent under takings repor ting at group level provide an adequate understanding of the risks for, and impacts of, their subsidiar y under takings, including information on their due diligence processes where appropr iate. There might be cases where the differ ences between the situation of the group and that of its individual subsidiar y under takings, or between the situation of individual subsidiar y under takings in differ ent territori es are particularly significant and would, in the absence of additional information about the individual subsidiar y under taking concer ned, cause the user of the information to reach a substantially differ ent conclusion about the risks for, or impacts of, the subsidiar y under taking. (27) Credit institutions and insurance under takings play a key role in the transition towards a fully sustainable and inclusive economic and financial system in line with the Green Deal. They can have signif icant positive and nega tive imp acts via their lending, investment and under writing activities. Credit institutions and insurance under takings other than those that are required to compl y with Directive 2013/34/EU, including cooperatives and mutual under takings, should theref ore be subject to sustainability repor ting requirements, provid ed that they meet certain size criteria. Users of sustainability information would thus be enabled to assess both the impacts of such credit institutions and insurance under takings on society and the environment and the risks arising from sustainability matte rs that such credit institutions and insurance under takings could face. Directive 2013/34/EU provi des for three possible criteria to determine whether an under taking is to be considered a ‘large under taking’, namely the balance sheet total, net turnover and the average number of emplo yees during the financial year . The criterion of net turnover needs to be adap ted for credit institutions and for insurance under takings by referring to the definition of net turnover in Council Directives 86/635/EEC (19)and 91/674/EEC (20)inste ad of the general definit ion laid down in Directive 2013/34/EU. To ensure coherence with the repor ting requirements of Directive 86/635/EEC, Member State s should be able to choose not to apply sustainability repor ting requirements to credit institutions listed in Article 2(5) of Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (21). (28) The list of sustainability matters on whic h under takings are required to repor t should be as consistent as possible with the definition of the term ‘sustainability factors’ laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, and should prevent a mismatch between information required by data users and information to be repor ted by under takings. That list should also correspond to the needs and expectations of users and under takings, who often use the term s ‘envir onmental’, ‘social’ and ‘gov ernance ’ as a means of cate gorising the three main sustainability matt ers. However , (19)Council Directive 86/635/EEC of 8 December 1986 on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of banks and other financial institutions (OJ L 372, 31.12.1986, p. 1). (20)Council Directive 91/674/EEC of 19 December 1991 on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of insurance under takings (OJ L 374, 31.12.1991, p. 7). (21)Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential super vision of credit institutions, amending Directive 2002/87/EC and repealing Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC (OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 338).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 16.12.2022 L 322/23 

--- Page 10 of 66 ---

the definition of the term ‘sustainability factors’ laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 does not explicitly include governance matters. The definit ion of the term ‘sustainability matte rs’ in Directive 2013/34/EU as amended by this amending Directive should theref ore cover envi ronmental, social and human rights, and governance factors, and incor porate the definition of the term ‘sustainability factors’ laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. The repor ting requirements of Directive 2013/34/EU should be without prejudice to national repor ting obligations. (29) Article 19a(1) and Article 29a(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU require repor ting not only on information to the extent necessar y for an understanding of the under taking’s development, performa nce and position, but also on information necessar y for an understanding of the impact of the under taking’s activities on environmental, social and employee matt ers, respect for human rights, anti-cor rupti on and briber y matters. Those Articles theref ore require under takings to repor t both on the impa cts of the activities of the under taking on people and the environment, and on how sustainability matt ers affect the under taking. That is refer red to as the double mat eriality perspective, in which the risks to the under taking and the impacts of the under taking each represent one mater iality perspective. The fitness check on corporate repor ting shows that those two perspectives are often not well underst ood or applied. It is theref ore necessar y to clarify that under takings should consider each mat eriality perspective in its own right, and should disclose information that is mate rial from both perspectives as well as information that is mate rial from only one perspective. (30) Article 19a(1) and Article 29a(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU require under takings to disclose information about five repor ting areas: business model; policies, including due dilig ence processes implement ed; the outcome of those policies; risks and risk manag ement ; and key performa nce indicator s relevant to the business. Article 19a(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU does not contain explicit references to other repor ting areas that users of information consider relevant, some of which align with disclosures included in internatio nal framew orks, including the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-relat ed Financial Disclosures. Disclosure requirements should be specifi ed in sufficient detail to ensure that under takings repor t information on their resilience in relation to risks relat ed to sustainability matt ers. In addition to the repor ting areas identif ied in Article 19a(1) and Article 29a(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU, under takings should be required to disclose information about their business strategy and the resilience of the business model and strateg y in relation to risks related to sustainability matt ers. They should also be required to disclose any plans they may have to ensure that their business model and strategy are compati ble with the transition to a sustainable econom y and with the objectives of limiting global warming to 1,5 °C in line with the Paris Agreement and achi eving climate neutrality by 2050, as established in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, with no or limited overshoot. It is especially important that plans relat ed to the climat e be based on the latest science, including Intergo vernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) repor ts and repor ts by the European Scientifi c Advisor y Board on Climate Change. Information disclosed in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 about the amount of capital expenditure (CapEx) or operating expenditure (OpEx) associated with taxonomy-al igned activities could suppor t financial and inve stment plans related to such plans where appropr iate. Under takings should also be required to disclose whether and how their business model and strateg y take account of the interests of stakeholders; any oppor tunities for the under taking arising from sustainability matters; the implementation of the aspects of the business strategy which affect, or are affected by, sustainability matt ers; any sustainability targe ts set by the under taking and the progress made towards achi eving them; the role of the board and managemen t with regard to sustainability matters; the principal actual and potential adverse impacts connecte d with the under taking’s activities; and how the under taking has identif ied the information that it repor ts on. Once the disclosure of elements, such as targets and the progress towards achi eving them, is required, a separate requirement to disclose the outcomes of policies is no long er necessar y. (31) To ensure consistency with internati onal instr uments such as the UN ‘Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the Unit ed Nations ‘Protect, Respect and Remedy’ Framew ork’ (‘UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights’ ), the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enter prises and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, the due dilig ence disclosure requirements should be specified in greate r detail than is currently the case in point (b) of Article 19a(1) and point (b) of Article 29a(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU. Due dilig ence is the process that under takings carry out to identify , monitor , prevent, mitig ate, remediate or bring an EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 322/24 16.12.2022 

--- Page 11 of 66 ---

end to the principal actual and poten tial adverse impacts connected with their activities and identifies how under takings address those adverse impacts. Impacts connected with an under taking’s activities include impacts directly caused by the under taking, impa cts to which the under taking contr ibut es, and impacts which are other wise linked to the under taking’s value chain. The due dilig ence process concer ns the whole value chain of the under taking including its own operations, its products and services, its business relationships and its supply chains. In line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, an actual or poten tial adverse impact is to be considered a principal impa ct where it ranks among the greate st impacts connected with the under taking’s activities based on: the grav ity of the impact on people or the envi ronment ; the number of individuals that are or could be affected, or the scale of damage to the environment ; and the ease with which the harm could be remediated , restor ing the environment or affect ed people to their prior state. (32) Directive 2013/34/EU does not require the disclosure of information on intangible resources other than intangible assets recognised in the balance sheet. It is widely recognised that information on intangible assets and other intangible factors, including internally generat ed intangible resources, is under repor ted, impeding the proper assessment of an under taking’s development, performa nce and position, and the monitori ng of inve stments. To enable investors to bette r understand the increasing gap between the accounting book value of man y under takings and their market valuation, which is obser ved in man y sectors of the economy , adequate repor ting on intangible resources should be required of all large under takings and all under takings, excep t micro-under takings, whose secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulate d market in the Union. Nonetheless, certain information on intangible resources is intrinsic to sustainability matt ers, and should theref ore be part of sustainability repor ting. For examp le, information about employees’ skills, compet ences, exper ience, loyalty to the under taking and motivation for impro ving processes, goods and services, is sustainability information rega rding social matters that could also be considered as information on intangible resources. Like wise, information about the quality of the relationships between the under taking and its stak eholders, including customer s, suppliers and communities affected by the activities of the under taking, is sustainability information relevant to social or governance matte rs that could also be considered as information on intangible resources. Such examples illustrate how in some cases it is not possible to distinguish information on intangible resources from information on sustainability matt ers. (33) Article 19a(1) and Article 29a(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU do not specify whether the information to be repor ted is to be forward-looking or information about past performa nce. There is currently a lack of forward-looking disclosures, which users of sustainability information especially value. Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU should theref ore specify that the sustainability information repor ted is to include forward-looking and retrospective information and both qualitative and quantitative information. Information should be based on conclusive scientific evidence where appropr iate. Information should also be harmonized, comparable and based on unif orm indicators where appropr iate, while allowing for repor ting that is specif ic to individual under takings and does not endange r the commercial position of the under taking. Repor ted sustainability information should also take into account shor t-, medium- and long-t erm time horizons and contain information about the under taking’s whole value chain, including its own operations, its products and services, its business relationships and its supply chain, as appropr iate. Information about the under taking’s whole value chain would include information relat ed to its value chain within the Union and information that covers third countr ies if the under taking’s value chain extends outside the Union. For the first three years of the application of the measures to be adop ted by the Member States in accordance with this amending Directive, in the event that not all the necessar y information regar ding the value chain is available, the under taking should explain the efforts made to obtain the information about its value chain, the reasons why that information could not be obtained, and the plans of the under taking to obtain such information in the future.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 16.12.2022 L 322/25

(34) It is not the objective of this amending Directive to require under takings to disclose intellectual capital, intellectual proper ty, know-ho w or the results of innovati on that would qualify as trade secrets as defined in Directive (EU) 2016/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council (22). Repor ting requirements provided for in this amending Directive should theref ore be without prejudice to Directive (EU) 2016/943. (35) Article 19a(1) and Article 29a(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU require under takings to include in their non-financial repor ting references to, and additional explanations of, amounts repor ted in the annual financial statements. Those Articles do not, however , require under takings to make references to other information in the management repor t or to add additional explanations to that information. Thus, there is currently a lack of consist ency between non- financial information repor ted and the rest of the information disclosed in the management repor t. It is necessar y to lay down clear requirements in this regard. (36) Article 19a(1) and Article 29a(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU require under takings to provid e a clear and reasoned explanation for not pursuing policies in relation to one or more of the matt ers listed in those Articles, where the under taking does not do so. The differ ent treatment of disclosures on the policies that under takings may have, compare d to the other repor ting areas included in those Articles, has created confusion among repor ting under takings and has not helped to improve the quality of the repor ted information. Theref ore, there is no need to maintain such different treatment of policies in that Directive. The sustainability repor ting standards should determine what information needs to be disclosed in relation to each of the repor ting areas mentioned in Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU as amended by this amending Directive. (37) Under takings that fall under the scope of Article 19a(1) and Article 29a(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU may rely on national, Union-based or international repor ting frameworks, and where they do so, they have to specify which framewor ks they have relied upon. However , Directive 2013/34/EU does not require under takings to use a common repor ting framewor k or standard, and it does not prevent under takings from choosing not to use any repor ting framew ork or standards at all. As required by Article 2 of Directive 2014/95/EU, on 5 July 2017 , the Commission adopt ed a Communication entitled ‘Guidelines on non-financial repor ting (methodology for repor ting non-fi nancial information)’ (‘Guidelines on non-f inancial repor ting’), provi ding for non-binding guidelines for under takings that fall under the scope of that Directive. On 17 June 2019 , the Commission adopt ed its Guidelines on repor ting climat e-relat ed information, containing additional guidelines, specifi cally on repor ting climate -related information. Those Guidelines on repor ting climat e- relat ed information explicitly incor porat ed the recommendations of the Task Force on Climat e-related Financial Disclosures. Available evidence indicates that the Guidelines on non-fi nancial repor ting did not have a signif icant imp act on the quality of non-fi nancial repor ting by under takings under the scope of Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU. The volun tary nature of the guidelines means that under takings are free to decide whether to apply them or not. The guidelines can theref ore not ensure on their own the comparab ility of the information disclosed by different under takings, or the disclosure of all information that users of that information consider relevant. That is why there is a need for mandatory common sustainability repor ting standards to ensure that information is compara ble and that all relevant information is disclosed. Building on the double mater iality principle, standards should cover all information that is mater ial to users of that information. Common sustainability repor ting standards are also necessar y to enable the assurance and digitalisation of sustainability repor ting and to facilitate its super vision and enforcement. The development of mandatory common sustainability repor ting standards is necessar y to reach a situation in whic h sustainability information has a status compara ble to that of financial information. The adoptio n of sustainability repor ting standards by means of delegat ed acts would ensure harmonised sustainability repor ting across the Union. (22)Directive (EU) 2016/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 on the protection of undisclosed know-ho w and business information (trade secrets) again st their unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure (OJ L 157, 15.6.2016, p. 1).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 322/26 16.12.2022 

--- Page 13 of 66 ---

Theref ore, an under taking would be compl iant with the sustainability repor ting requirements of Directive 2013/34/EU by repor ting in accordance with the sustainability repor ting standards. When defining such standards, it is essential to give due consideration, to the greatest extent possible, to the main sustainability repor ting standards used worldwide, while not lowering the ambition of this amending Directive and delegat ed acts adopt ed pursuant thereto. (38) No existing standard or framewor k satisfies the Union’s needs for sustainability repor ting by itself. Information required by Directive 2013/34/EU needs to cover information relevant from each of the mate riality perspectives, needs to cover all sustainability matt ers and needs to be aligned, where appropr iate, with other oblig ations under Union law to disclose sustainability information, including obligations laid down in Regulations (EU) 2019/2088 and (EU) 2020/852. In addition, mandatory sustainability repor ting standards for Union under takings should be commensurat e with the level of ambition of the Green Deal and the Union’s objective of climate neutrality by 2050 as well as with the interm ediat e targets under Regulation (EU) 2021/1119. It is theref ore necessar y to empower the Commission to adopt Union sustainability repor ting standards, enabling their rapid adopt ion and ensur ing that the conte nt of those sustainability repor ting standards is consistent with the Union’s needs. (39) The European Financial Repor ting Advisor y Group (EFRA G) is a non-profit association established under Belgian law that serves the public interest by provid ing advice to the Commission on the endorsement of international financial repor ting standards. EFRA G has established a reputation as a European centre of exper tise on corporat e repor ting and is well placed to foster coordination between Union sustainability repor ting standards and internati onal initiatives that seek to develop standards that are consistent across the world. In March 2021, a multi- stake holder task force set up by EFRA G published recommendations for the possible development of sustainability repor ting standards for the Union. Those recommendations contain proposals to develop a coherent and compreh ensive set of sustainability repor ting standards, cover ing all sustainability matte rs from a double mater iality perspective. Those recommendations also contain a detailed roadmap for developing such standards, and proposals for mutually reinf orcing cooperation between global standard-setting initiatives and standard-setting initiatives of the Union. In March 2021, the EFRA G Board President published recommendations for possible govern ance changes to EFRA G in the event that it were to be asked to develop technical advice about sustainability repor ting standards. The EFRA G Board President’s recommendations include the setting up of a new sustainability repor ting pillar within EFRA G, while not signif icantly modifying the existing financial repor ting pillar . In Marc h 2022, the EFRA G General Assembly appointe d the members of the newly creat ed EFRA G Sustainability Repor ting Board. When adop ting sustainability repor ting standards, the Commission should take account of technical advice that EFRA G will develop. In order to ensure high-quality standards that contr ibut e to the European public good and meet the needs of under takings and of users of the information repor ted, EFRA G should have sufficient public funding to ensure its independence. Its technical advice should be developed with proper due process, public oversight and transparency , and based on the exper tise of a balanced representation of relevant stak eholders, including under takings, invest ors, civil society organisations and trade unions, and should be accompanied by cost-benefi t analyses. Participation in EFRA G’s work at technical level should be conditional on exper tise in sustainability repor ting and should not be conditional on any financial contr ibution, without prejudice to the participation of public bodies and national standard-setting organisations in that work. A transparent process avoiding conf licts of interest should be guarant eed. To ensure that Union sustainability repor ting standards take account of the views of the Member State s, before adopting those standards the Commission should consult the Member State Exper t Group on Sustainable Finance, referred to in Regulation (EU) 2020/852, (the ‘Member State Exper t Group on Sustainable Finance’) and the Accounting Regulator y Committ ee, referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (23), (the ‘Accounting Regulat ory Committ ee’) in relation to EFRA G’s technical advice.

The European Secur ities and Mark ets Author ity (ESMA), the European Banking Author ity (EBA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOP A) play a role in draf ting regulatory technical standards pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 and there needs to be coherence between those regulator y technical standards and sustainability repor ting standards. Under Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (24), ESMA also plays a role in promoting super visor y convergence in the enforcement of corporate repor ting by issuers whose secur ities are admitt ed to trading on a regulated market in the Union and who will be required to repor t in accordance with those sustainability repor ting standards. Theref ore, ESMA, EBA and EIOP A should be required to provide an opinion on EFRA G’s technical advice. Such opinions should be provid ed within two months of the date of receipt of the request from the Commission. In addition, the Commission should consult the European Environment Agen cy, the European Union Agen cy for Fundamental Rights, the ECB, the Committ ee of European Auditing Oversight Bodies (CEA OB) and the Platf orm on Sustainable Finance to ensure that the sustainability repor ting standards are coherent with relevant Union policy and law. Where any of those entities decide to submit an opinion, they should do so within two months of the date of being consulted by the Commission. (40) In order to foste r democratic control, scrutiny and transparency , the Commission should, at least once a year, consult the European Parliament, and jointly the Member State Exper t Group on Sustainable Finance and the Accounting Regulat ory Committ ee on EFRA G’s work programme as regards the development of sustainability repor ting standards. (41) Sustainability repor ting standards should be coherent with other Union law. Those standards should in particular be aligned with the disclosure requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, and they should take account of underlying indicators and methodologies set out in the various delegat ed acts adopt ed pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2020/852, disclosure requirements applicable to benchmark administrator s pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (25), the minimum standards for the constr uction of EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks, and of any work carried out by the EBA in the imp lementation of the Pillar III disclosure requirements of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Standards should take account of Union environmental law, including Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (26)and Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (27), and should take account of Commission Recommendation 2013/179/EU (28), its annex es and their update s. Other relevant Union law, including Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (29), and other requirements laid down in Union law for under takings as regar ds direct ors’ duties and due dilig ence should also be taken into account.

(42) Sustainability repor ting standards should take account of the Guidelines on non-f inancial repor ting and the Guidelines on repor ting climat e-relat ed information. They should also take account of other repor ting requirements in Directive 2013/34/EU that are not directly related to sustainability , with the aim of provi ding the users of the repor ted information with a better understanding of the development, performa nce, position and impact of the under taking, by maximising the link s between the sustainability information and other information repor ted in accordance with Directive 2013/34/EU. (43) Sustainability repor ting standards should be propor tionate and should not impose an unnecessar y administrative burden on companies that are required to use them. In order to minimise disrupti on for under takings that already repor t sustainability information, sustainability repor ting standards should take account of existing standards and framewor ks for sustainability repor ting and accounting where appropr iate. Such existing standards and frameworks include the Global Repor ting Initiative, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, the Internatio nal Integrated Repor ting Council, the Intern ational Accounting Standards Board, the Task Force on Climate-r elated Financial Disclosures, the Carbon Disclosure Standards Board, and CDP , formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project. Union standards should take account of any sustainability repor ting standards developed under the auspices of Internatio nal Financial Repor ting Standards Foundation. To avoid unnecessar y regulator y fragmentation that could have nega tive consequences for under takings operating globally , Union sustainability repor ting standards should contr ibut e to the process of converg ence of sustainability repor ting standards at global level, by suppor ting the work of the Internati onal Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). Union sustainability repor ting standards should reduce the risk of inconsist ent repor ting requirements for under takings that operat e globally by integrat ing the conte nt of global baseline standards to be developed by the ISSB, to the extent that the content of those baseline standards is consistent with the Union’s legal framework and the objectives of the Green Deal. (44) In the Green Deal the Commission committed itself to suppor t businesses and other stak eholders in developing standardised natural capital accounting practices within the Union and internatio nally , with the aim of ensur ing appropr iate management of environmental risks and mitig ation oppor tunities, and reduce related transaction costs. The Transparent Project sponsored under the Programme for the Environment and Climate Action (LIFE programme) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/783 of the European Parliament and of the Council (30)is developing the first natural capital accounting methodology , which will make existing methods easier to compare and more transparent while lower ing the threshold for companies to adopt and use the syste ms in suppor t of future-proofing their business. The Natural Capital Protocol is also an impor tant referen ce in the field of natural capital accounting. While natural capital accounting methods serve principally to strengthen internal management decisions, they should be duly considered when establishing sustainability repor ting standards. Some natural capital accounting methodologies seek to assign a monetar y value to the environmental impacts of companies’ activities, which may help users of sustainability information to bette r understand such impacts. It is theref ore appropr iate that sustainability repor ting standards should be able to include monetised indicators of sustainability impacts if that is deemed necessar y. (45) Sustainability repor ting standards should also take account of internati onally recognised principles and frameworks on responsible business conduct, corporate social responsibility , and sustainable development, including the SDGs, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enter prises, the OECD Due Dilig ence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct and relat ed sectoral guidelines, the Global Com pact, the Intern ational Labour Org anization’s (ILO) Tripar tite Declaration of Principles concer ning Multinational Enterpr ises and Social Policy , the ISO 26000 standard on social responsibility , and the UN Principles for Responsible Investment.

(46) It should be ensured that the information repor ted by under takings in accordance with the sustainability repor ting standards meets the needs of users and does not place a dispropor tionat e burden in term s of effort and cost on the repor ting under takings and those that are indirectly affected as part of the value chain of those under takings. The sustainability repor ting standards should theref ore specify the information that under takings are to disclose on all major environmental factors, including their impacts and dependencies on climat e, air, land, water and biodiversity . Regulation (EU) 2020/852 provid es a classificat ion of the environmental objectives of the Union. For reasons of coherence, it is appropr iate to use a similar classification to identify the environmental factors that should be addressed by sustainability repor ting standards. The sustainability repor ting standards should consider and specify any geographical or other conte xtual information that under takings should disclose to provi de an understanding of their principal impa cts on sustainability matt ers and the principal risks to the under taking arising from sustainability matt ers. When specifying the information about environmental factors that under takings are to disclose, coherence should be ensured with the definitions laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and the repor ting requirements laid down in Article 8 of that Regulation and in the delegat ed acts adopt ed pursuant to that Regulation. (47) With regard to climat e-related information, users are interested in knowing about under takings’ physical and transition risks, and about their resilience as regards, and plans to adap t to, differ ent climate scenar ios and plans to adapt to the Union’s objective of climat e neutrality by 2050. They are also interest ed in the level and scope of GHG emissions and removals attributed to the under taking, including the extent to whic h the under taking uses offsets and the source of those offsets. Achieving a climat e neutral econom y requires the alignment of GHG accounting and offsetting standards. Users need reliable information regar ding offsets that addresses concer ns regarding possible double counting and overestimations, given the risks to the achi evement of climate -related targets that double counting and overestimations can creat e. Users are also interested to know the efforts made by compan ies to effectively reduce absolute GHG emissions as part of their climate mitigation and adaptation strategies, including scope 1, scope 2 and, where relevant, scope 3 emissions. With regard to scope 3 emissions, a priority for users is to receive information about whic h scope 3 catego ries are signif icant in the case of the under taking, and about the emissions in each of those scope 3 catego ries. The sustainability repor ting standards should theref ore specify the information under takings should repor t with regar d to such matters. (48) Achieving a climat e-neutral and circular economy without diffuse pollution requires the full mobilisation of all economic sectors. Reducing energy use and increasing energy efficiency is key in this respect, as energy is used across supply chains. Energy aspects should theref ore be duly considered in sustainability repor ting standards, in particular in relation to envi ronmental matte rs, including climat e-related matt ers. (49) Sustainability repor ting standards should specify the information that under takings should disclose on social factors, including working conditions, social partner involvement, collective bargaining, equality , non-discr imination, diversity and inclusion, and human rights. Such information should cover the impacts of the under taking on people, including workers, and on human health. The information that under takings disclose about human rights should include information about forced labour and child labour in their value chains where relevant. Sustainability repor ting requirements concer ning forced labour should not free public author ities of their responsibility to address, through trade policy and diplomatic means, the import of goods produced as a result of human rights abuses, including forced labour . Under takings should also be able to repor t on possible risks and trends regarding emplo yment and incomes. Sustainability repor ting standards that address social factors should specify the information that under takings should disclose with regard to the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights that are relevant to businesses, including equal oppor tunities for all and working conditions. The Action Plan on the European Pillar of Social Rights, adop ted by the Commission on 4 Marc h 2021 , calls for stronger requirements on under takings to repor t on social issues. The sustainability repor ting standards should also specify the information that under takings should disclose with regar d to the human rights, fundamental freedoms, democratic principles and standards established in the Internati onal Bill of Human Rights and other core UN human rights conventions, including the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indige nous Peoples, the UN EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 322/30 16.12.2022

Conv ention on the Rights of the Child, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the fundamental conventions of the ILO, the European Conv ention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the European Social Char ter, and the Char ter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Repor ting carried out on social factors, as well as on envi ronmental and govern ance factors, should be propor tionat e to the scope and the goals of this amending Directive. Sustainability repor ting standards that address gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value should specify , amongst other things, information to be repor ted about the gender pay gap, taking account of other relevant Union law. Sustainability repor ting standards that address employment and inclusion of people with disabilities should specify , amongst other things, information to be repor ted about accessibility measures taken by the under taking. Sustainability repor ting standards that address training and skills development should specify , amongst other things, information to be repor ted about the propor tion and breakdown of workers participating in training. Sustainability repor ting standards that address collective bargaining should specify , amongst other things, information to be disclosed about the existen ce of works councils as well as the existen ce of collective agreements and the propor tion of work ers covered by such agreements. Sustainability repor ting standards that address participation of worke rs should specify , amongst other things, information to be disclosed about the participation of work ers in administrative and super visor y boards. Sustainability repor ting standards that address diversity should specify , amongst other things, information to be repor ted on gender diversity at top management and the number of members of the under -represented sex on their boards. (50) Users need information about govern ance factors. Gov ernance factors that are most relevant to users are liste d by author itative repor ting frameworks such as the Global Repor ting Initiative and the Task Force on Climate-r elated Financial Disclosures, as well as by author itative global framewor ks such as the Global Gover nance Principles of the Internatio nal Corporate Gov ernance Networ k and the G20/OECD Principles of Corporat e Gover nance. Sustainability repor ting standards should specify the information that under takings should disclose on govern ance factors. Such information should cover the role of an under taking’s administrative, manag ement and super visor y bodies with regard to sustainability matters, the exper tise and skills needed to fulfil that role or the access such bodies have to such exper tise and skills, whether the compan y has a policy in terms of incentives which are offered to members of those bodies and whic h are linke d to sustainability matt ers, and information on an under taking’s internal control and risk manag ement system s in relation to the sustainability repor ting process. Users also need information about under takings’ corporate culture and approach to business ethics, whic h are recognised elements of author itative framewor ks on corporat e governance , such as the Global Gov ernance Principles of the Internatio nal Corporat e Govern ance Network, including information about anti-cor ruption and anti-br iber y, and about the under taking’s activities and commitments aimed at exer ting its political influence, including its lobb ying activities. Information about the management of the under taking and the quality of relationships with customer s, suppliers and communities affected by the activities of the under taking, helps users to understand an under taking’s risks and imp acts relat ed to sustainability matters. Information about relationships with suppliers includes payment practices relating to the date or period for payment, the rate of interest for late payment or the compen sation for recovery costs referred to in Directive 2011/7/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (31). Ever y year, thousands of businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (‘SMEs’ ), suffe r an administrative and financial burden because they are paid late, or not at all. Ultimat ely, late payments lead to insolvency and bankr uptcy , with destr uctive effects on entire value chains. Increasing the amount of information about payment practices should empo wer other under takings to identify promp t and reliable payers, detect unfa ir payment practices, access information about the businesses they trade with, and negotiate fairer payment term s. (31)Directive 2011/7/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 Febr uary 2011 on combating late payment in commercial transactions (OJ L 48, 23.2.2011, p. 1).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 16.12.2022 L 322/31

(51) The sustainability repor ting standards should promot e a more integrat ed view of all the information published by under takings in the manag ement repor t to provid e users of that information with a better understanding of the development, performance, position and impact of the under taking. The sustainability repor ting standards should distinguish, as necessar y, between information that under takings should disclose when repor ting at individual level and the information that under takings should disclose when repor ting at group level. The sustainability repor ting standards should also contain guidance for under takings on the process for identifying the sustainability information that should be included in the manage ment repor t, since an under taking should only be required to disclose the information relevant to understanding its impa cts on sustainability matt ers, and the information relevant to understanding how sustainability matte rs affect its development, performa nce and position. (52) Member States should ensure that sustainability repor ting is carried out in compl iance with work ers’ rights to information and consultation. The manag ement of the under taking should theref ore inform workers’ representatives at the appropr iate level and discuss with them relevant information and the means of obtaining and verifying sustainability information. This implies for the purpose of this amending Directive the establishment of dialogue and exchange of views between worke rs’ representatives and central manag ement or any other level of manage ment that could be more appropr iate, at such times, in such fashion and with such content as would enable workers’ representatives to express their opinion. Their opinion should be communicated, where applicable, to the relevant administrative, manage ment or super visor y bodies. (53) Under takings in the same sector are often exposed to similar sustainability-relate d risks, and they often have similar imp acts on society and the environment. Com parisons between under takings in the same sector are especially valuable to inve stors and other users of sustainability information. Sustainability repor ting standards should theref ore specify both information that under takings in all sectors should disclose and information that under takings should disclose depending on their sector of activity . Sector -specifi c sustainability repor ting standards are especially imp ortant in the case of sectors associated with high sustainability risks for or impacts on the environment, human rights and govern ance, including sectors listed in Sections A to H and Section L of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (32), and the relevant activities within those sector s. When adopt ing sector -specif ic sustainability repor ting standards, the Commission should ensure the information specifi ed by those sustainability repor ting standards is propor tionat e to the scale of the risks and imp acts relat ed to sustainability matters specific to each sector , taking account of the fact that the risks and impacts of some sector s are higher than for others. The Commission should also take account of the fact that not all activities within such sector s are necessar ily associated with high sustainability risks or impacts. For under takings that operat e in sectors particularly reliant on natural resources, sector -specif ic sustainability repor ting standards would require the disclosure of nature-related impacts on and risks for biodiversity and ecosystems. Sustainability repor ting standards should also take account of the difficulties that under takings may encounter in gathering information from actors throughout their value chain, especially from suppliers that are small or medium-sized under takings and from suppliers in emerging mark ets and economies. Sustainability repor ting standards should specify disclosures concer ning value chains that are propor tionate and relevant to the scale and compl exity of the activities of the under takings, and the capacities and charact eristics of under takings in value chains, especially those capacities and charact eristics of under takings that are not subject to the sustainability repor ting requirements provid ed for in this amending Directive. Sustainability repor ting standards should not specify disclosures that would require under takings to obtain information from small and medium-sized under takings in their value chain that exceed s the information to be disclosed in accordance with the sustainability repor ting standards for small and medium-sized under takings. This should be without prejudice to any Union requirements on under takings to conduct a due diligence process.

(54) To meet the information needs of users in a timely manner , and in particular given the urgency to meet the information needs of financial mark et participants subject to the requirements laid down in the delegat ed acts adopt ed pursuant to Article 4(6) and (7) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, the Commission should adopt a first set of sustainability repor ting standards by means of delegat ed acts by 30 June 2023 . That set of sustainability repor ting standards should specify the information that under takings should disclose with regar d to all repor ting areas and sustainability matte rs, and that financial mark et participants need to compl y with the disclosure obligations laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. The Commission should adopt a second set of sustainability repor ting standards by means of delega ted acts by 30 June 2024 , specifying compl ementar y information that under takings should disclose about sustainability matte rs and repor ting areas, where necessar y, and information that is specif ic to the sector in whic h an under taking operates. The Commission should review those sustainability repor ting standards, including the sustainability repor ting standards for small and medium-sized under takings, ever y three years to take account of relevant developments, including the development of intern ational standards. (55) Directive 2013/34/EU does not require that under takings provid e their management repor ts in a digital format, which hinders the findability and usability of the repor ted information. Users of sustainability information increasing ly expect such information to be findable, compar able and mach ine-readable in digital formats. Member State s should be able to require that under takings subject to the sustainability repor ting requirements of Directive 2013/34/EU make their manag ement repor ts available on their website s, free of charg e to the public. Digitalisation creat es oppor tunities to exploit information more efficiently and holds the poten tial for signif icant cost savings for both users and under takings. Digitalisation also enables the centralisation at Union and Member State level of data in an open and accessible format that facilitates reading and allows for the comparison of data. Under takings should theref ore be required to prepare their manag ement repor t in the electronic repor ting format specifi ed in Article 3 of Commission Delegat ed Regulation (EU) 2019/815 (33), and to mark up their sustainability repor ting, including the disclosures required by Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in accordance with the electronic repor ting format specifi ed in Delegat ed Regulation (EU) 2019/815 once that is determined. A digital taxonomy for the Union sustainability repor ting standards will be necessar y to allow the repor ted information to be tagg ed in accordance with those sustainability repor ting standards. These requirements should feed into the work on digitalisation announced by the Commission in its Communication of 19 Febr uary 2020 entitled ‘A European strategy for data’ and in its Communication of 24 Sept ember 2020 entitled ‘Digital Finance Strateg y for the EU’. These requirements would also compl ement the creation of a European sing le access point (ESAP) for public corporate information as envisaged in the Commission’s Communication of 24 Sept ember 2020 entitled ‘A Capital Mark ets Union for people and businesses - new action plan’ in which the need to provide comparab le information in a digital format is also considered. (56) To allow for the inclusion of the repor ted sustainability information in the ESA P, Member States should ensure that under takings whose secur ities are not admitt ed to trading on a regulated market in the Union publish their manage ment repor t, including sustainability repor ting, in the electronic repor ting format specifi ed in Article 3 of Delegat ed Regulation (EU) 2019/815. (57) Article 19a(4) of Directive 2013/34/EU enables Member States to exem pt under takings from including in the manage ment repor t the non-f inancial state ment required under Article 19a(1) of that Directive. Member States are allowe d to do so where the under taking concer ned prepares a separate repor t that is published together with the manage ment repor t in accordance with Article 30 of that Directive, or where that repor t is made publicly available on the under taking’s website within a reasonable period of time not exceed ing 6 months after the balance sheet date , and is referred to in the managemen t repor t. The same possibility exists for the consolidated non-financial state ment refer red to in Directive 2013/34/EU. Twenty Member States have used that option. The possibility of publishing a separate repor t hinders, however , the availability of information that connects financial information and information on sustainability matters. It also hinders the findability and accessibility of information for users, especially invest ors, who are interested in both financial and sustainability information. Possible differ ent publication times for financial and sustainability information exacerbate that problem. Publication in a separate (33)Commission Delegat ed Regulation (EU) 2019/815 of 17 December 2018 supplementing Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulat ory technical standards on the specificatio n of a sing le electronic repor ting format (OJ L 143, 29.5.2019, p. 1).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 16.12.2022 L 322/33 

--- Page 20 of 66 ---

repor t can also give the impression, internal ly and extern ally, that sustainability information belongs to a cate gory of less relevant information, which can impact negat ively on the perceived reliability of the information. Unde rtakings should theref ore repor t sustainability information in a clearly identif iable dedicat ed section of the management repor t and Member States should no long er be allowed to exempt under takings from the oblig ation to include in the manage ment repor t information on sustainability matt ers. Such oblig ation would also help to clarify the role of national compet ent author ities in super vising sustainability repor ting, as part of the management repor t prepared in accordance with Directive 2004/109/EC. In addition, under takings required to repor t sustainability information should in no case be exem pted from the oblig ation to publish the manag ement repor t, as it is impor tant to ensure that sustainability information is publicly available. (58) Article 20 of Directive 2013/34/EU requires under takings whose secur ities are admitte d to trading on a regulat ed mark et in the Union to include a corporat e governance state ment in their management repor t, whic h has to contain, among other information, a descr iption of the diversity policy applied by the under taking in relation to its administrative, manage ment and super visor y bodies. Article 20 of Directive 2013/34/EU leav es flexibility to under takings to decide what aspects of diversity they repor t on. It does not explicitly oblig e under takings to include information on any particular aspect of diversity . In order to progress towards a more gender -balanced participation in economic decision-making, it is necessar y to ensure that under takings whose secur ities are admitt ed to trading on a regulated market in the Union alwa ys repor t on their gender diversity policies and the implementation thereof. However , to avoid an unnecessar y administrative burden, such under takings should have the possibility of repor ting some of the information required by Article 20 of Directive 2013/34/EU alongside other sustainability information. If they decide to do so, the corporat e govern ance statement should include a referen ce to the under taking’s sustainability repor ting, and the information required under Article 20 of Directive 2013/34/EU should remain subject to the assurance requirements of the corporat e governance statement. (59) Article 33 of Directive 2013/34/EU requires Member States to ensure that the members of the administrative, manage ment and super visor y bodies of an under taking have collective responsibility for ensur ing that the annual financial statemen ts, the consolidat ed financial statements, the manag ement repor t, the consolidate d management repor t, the corporat e governance statement and the consolidated corporate govern ance statement are drawn up and published in accordance with the requirements of that Directive. That collective responsibility should be extende d to the digitalisation requirements laid down in Delegat ed Regulation (EU) 2019/815, to the requirement to compl y with Union sustainability repor ting standards and to the requirement to mark up sustainability repor ting. (60) The assurance profession distinguishes between limite d assurance engag ements and reasonable assurance engag ements. The conclusion of a limited assurance engag ement is usually provi ded in a negativ e form of expression by stating that no matt er has been identified by the practitioner to conclude that the subject matt er is mater ially misstated. In a limite d assurance enga gement, the auditor performs fewer tests than in a reasonable assurance engag ement. The amount of work for a limited assurance engagement is theref ore less than for a reasonable assurance engag ement. The amount of work in a reasonable assurance engag ement entails extensi ve procedures including consideration of intern al controls of the repor ting under taking and substantive testing, and is theref ore significantly greater than in a limite d assurance enga gement. The conclusion of a reasonable assurance engag ement is usually provided in a positive form of expression and results in provid ing an opinion on the measurement of the subject matte r against previously defined criteria. Directive 2013/34/EU requires Member States to ensure that the statut ory auditor or audit firm checks whether the non- financial state ment or the separate repor t has been provid ed. It does not require that an independent provider of assurance services verify the information, although it allows Member States to require such verification where they so wish. The absence of an assurance requirement concer ning sustainability repor ting, in contrast to the requirement for the statutor y auditor to carry out statutor y audits based on a reasonable assurance engag ement, would threaten the credibility of the sustainability information disclosed, thus failing to meet the needs of the EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 322/34 16.12.2022 

--- Page 21 of 66 ---

intended users of that information. Although the objective is to have a similar level of assurance for financial and sustainability repor ting, the absence of a commonly agreed standard for the assurance of sustainability repor ting creat es the risk of diffe rent understandings and expectations of what a reasonable assurance enga gement would consist of for different categor ies of sustainability information, especially with regar d to forward-looking and qualitative disclosures. Theref ore, a progressive approach to enhancing the level of the assurance required for sustainability information should be considered, starting with an oblig ation on the statutor y auditor or audit firm to express an opinion about the compliance of the sustainability repor ting with Union requirements based on a limited assurance engag ement. That opinion should cover the compl iance of the sustainability repor ting with Union sustainability repor ting standards, the process carried out by the under taking to identify the information repor ted pursuant to the sustainability repor ting standards and compl iance with the requirement to mark up sustainability repor ting. The auditor should also assess whether the under taking’s repor ting complies with the repor ting requirements of Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852. To ensure a common understanding and common expectations of what a reasonable assurance engag ement would consist of, the statut ory auditor or audit firm should be required to express an opinion based on a reasonable assurance engag ement about the compliance of the sustainability repor ting with Union requirements, when the Commission adopts assurance standards for reasonable assurance of sustainability repor ting by means of delegat ed acts no later than 1 October 2028 , following an assessment to deter mine if reasonable assurance is feasible for auditors and under takings. The gradual approach from limited assurance engag ements to reasonable assurance engag ements would also allow for the progressive development of the assurance mark et for sustainability information, and of under takings’ repor ting practices. Finally , such gradual approach would phase in the increase in costs for repor ting under takings, given that assurance of sustainability repor ting based on a reasonable assurance engag ement is more costly than assurance of sustainability repor ting based on a limite d assurance engag ement. Under takings subject to sustainability repor ting requirements should be able to decide to have an assurance opinion on their sustainability repor ting based on a reasonable assurance engag ement if they so wish, and in such cases they should be deemed to have compl ied with the oblig ation to have an opinion based on a limited assurance engag ement. The opinion based on a reasonable assurance engag ement concer ning forward-looking information is only an assurance that such information has been prepared in accordance with applicable standards. (61) Statut ory auditors or audit firms already verify the financial statements and the management repor t. The assurance of sustainability repor ting by the statutor y auditors or audit firms would help to ensure the connectivity between, and consiste ncy of, financia l and sustainability information, which is particularly important for users of sustainability information. However , there is a risk of further concentration of the audit mark et, which could risk the independence of auditors and increase audit fees or fees relating to the assurance of sustainability repor ting. Consider ing the key role of statut ory auditors when providin g assurance of sustainability repor ting and ensur ing reliable sustainability information, the Commission has announced that it will act to further enhance audit quality and to create a more open and diversif ied audit market, which are the conditions for the successful application of this amending Directive. In addition, it is desirable to offer under takings a broader choice of independent assurance services provid ers for the assurance of sustainably repor ting. Member States should theref ore be allowed to accredit independent assurance services providers in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (34)to provid e an assurance opinion on sustainability repor ting, which should be published together with the management repor t. In addition, Member State s should be given the option of allowing (34)Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 339/93 (OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 30).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 16.12.2022 L 322/35

a statutor y auditor , other than the one(s) carrying out the statutor y audit of the financia l state ments, to express an assurance opinion on sustainability repor ting. Further more, if they allow independent assurance services provid ers to carry out the assurance of sustainability repor ting, Member States should also allow a statut ory auditor , other than the one(s) carrying out the statut ory audit of the financial statements, to express an assurance opinion on sustainability repor ting. Member States should set out requirements that ensure the quality of the assurance of sustainability repor ting carried out by independent assurance services providers and consistent outcomes in the assurance of sustainability repor ting. Theref ore, all independent assurance services providers should be subject to requirements that are equivalent to the requirements set out in Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (35) as regar ds the assurance of sustainability repor ting, while being adap ted to the charact eristics of independent assurance services providers which do not carry out statut ory audits. In particular , Member State s should set out equivalent requirements as regards training and examination, continuing education, quality assurance system s, professiona l ethics, independence, objectivity , conf identiality and profess ional secrecy , appointment and dismissal, the organisation of the work of independent assurance services provid ers, investig ations and sanctions, and the repor ting of irregular ities. This would also guarant ee a level playing field among all persons and firms allowed by Member States to provid e an assurance opinion on sustainability repor ting, including statutor y auditors. If an under taking seeks the opinion of an accredit ed independent assurance services provid er other than the statutor y auditor on its sustainability repor ting, it should not in addition need to request an assurance opinion on its sustainability repor ting from the statutor y auditor . Independent assurance services provid ers that have already been accredited by a Member State for the assurance of sustainability repor ting should continue to be allowe d to do so. Like wise, Member States should ensure that independent assurance services providers that, by the date of application of the new requirements on training and examination, are undergoing their accreditation process are not subject to those new accreditation requirements, provid ed they compl ete that process within two years of the date of application of those new requirements. Member State s should, however , ensure that all the independent assurance services providers accredite d by a Member State for the assurance of sustainability repor ting within two years of the date of application of the new accreditation requirements, acquire the necessar y knowledg e in sustainability repor ting and the assurance of sustainability repor ting through continued profes sional education. (62) In order to foste r the free move ment of services, Member State s should allow independent assurance services provid ers established in a diffe rent Member State to carry out the assurance of sustainability repor ting in their territory . This would also favour opening up the assurance mark et even when not all Member State s allow for the accreditation of independent assurance services provid ers in their territory. Where independent assurance services provid ers carry out the assurance of sustainability repor ting in the territory of a host Member State, that host Member State should be able to decide to super vise independent assurance services providers, given the possibility to leverage on the implement ed framew ork for the super vision of auditors carrying out the assurance of sustainability repor ting. (63) Member States should ensure that when an under taking is required by Union law to have elements of its sustainability repor ting verified by an accredit ed independent third party, the repor t of the accredited independent third party should be made available either as an annex to the manage ment repor t or by any other publicly accessible means. Such making available of that repor t should not pre-emp t the outcome of the assurance opinion of whic h the third-par ty verification should remain independent. It should not entail any duplication of work between the auditor or the independent assurance services provider that expresses the assurance opinion and the accredite d independent third party.

(64) Directive 2006/43/EC sets out rules concer ning the statut ory audit of annual and consolidated financial statements. It is necessar y to ensure that consistent rules apply to the audit of financial statements and the assurance of sustainability repor ting by the statut ory auditor . Directive 2006/43/EC should apply where the assurance opinion on sustainability repor ting is expressed by a statut ory auditor or an audit firm. (65) The rules on the approval and recognition of statutor y auditors and audit firms should allow statutor y auditor s to qualify also for the assurance of sustainability repor ting. Member States should ensure that statutor y auditors who wish to qualify for the assurance of sustainability repor ting have the necessar y level of theoretical knowledg e of subjects relevant to the assurance of sustainability repor ting and the ability to apply such knowledg e in practice. Theref ore, statut ory auditors should complet e practical training of at least eight months in the assurance of annual and consolidated sustainability repor ting or in other sustainability-relate d services, taking account of previous emplo yment exper ience. Howe ver, statut ory auditors that have already been appro ved or recognised in a Member State should continue to be allowed to carry out the assurance of sustainability repor ting. Likewise, Member States should ensure that natural persons who are undergoing the approval process at the date of application of the requirements for the assurance of sustainability repor ting established by this amending Directive are not subject to those requirements, provid ed they complet e the process within the follo wing two years. Member States should, however , ensure that statut ory auditors appro ved within two years of the date of application of those requirements and who wish to carry out the assurance of sustainability repor ting acquire the necessar y knowledg e in sustainability repor ting and the assurance of sustainability repor ting via continued profes sional education. Natural persons who decide to be appro ved only as statut ory auditors for statutor y audit should be able to decide at a later point in time to qualify also for the assurance of sustainability repor ting. In order to do so, such persons should meet the necessar y requirements set out by Member States to ensure that they also have the necessar y level of theoretical knowledg e of subjects relevant to the assurance of sustainability repor ting and the ability to apply such knowledg e in practice. (66) It should be ensured that the requirements imposed on auditors as regar ds the statutor y audit and the assurance of sustainability repor ting they carry out are consiste nt. Theref ore, there should be at least one designate d person who is actively involved in carrying out the assurance of sustainability repor ting (‘key sustainability partner ’). When carrying out the assurance of sustainability repor ting, statut ory auditors should be required to devot e sufficient time and assign sufficient resources and exper tise in order to carry out their duties appropr iately . The client account record should specify the fees charged for the assurance of sustainability repor ting and an assurance file should be creat ed to include information relat ed to the assurance of sustainability repor ting. Where the same statutor y auditor carries out the statut ory audit of annual financial state ments and the assurance of sustainability repor ting, it should be possible to include the assurance file in the audit file. However , requirements imposed on statut ory auditors relating to the assurance of sustainability repor ting should only apply to those statut ory auditors that carry out the assurance of sustainability repor ting. (67) Statut ory auditors or audit firms that carry out the assurance of sustainability repor ting should have a high level of technical and specialised exper tise in the field of sustainability . (68) Directive 2006/43/EC requires Member States to put appropr iate rules in place to avoid the fees on the statut ory audit being influenced or determined by the provision of additional services to the audited entity or being based on any form of contingenc y. That Directive also requires Member States to ensure that statutor y auditors carrying out statut ory audits compl y with the rules on professional ethics, independence, objectivity , confidentiality and professiona l secrecy . For reasons of coherence, it is appropr iate that those rules be exte nded to statutor y auditors carrying out the assurance of sustainability repor ting.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 16.12.2022 L 322/37

(69) In order to provid e for unif orm assurance practices and high-quality assurance of sustainability repor ting across the Union, the Commission should be empowered to adopt sustainability assurance standards by means of delega ted acts. Member States should be given the possibility of applying national assurance standards, procedures or requirements, as long as the Commission has not adopt ed an assurance standard by means of delegat ed acts covering the same subject matt er. Such assurance standards should set out the procedures that the auditor is to perform in order to draw its conclusions on the assurance of sustainability repor ting. Theref ore, the Commission should adop t assurance standards for limited assurance by means of delegat ed acts before 1 October 2026 . With a view to facilitating the harmonisation of the assurance of sustainability repor ting across Member State s, the CEA OB should be encouraged to adopt non-binding guidelines to set out the procedures to be performe d when expressing an assurance opinion on sustainability repor ting, pending the adop tion by the Commission of an assurance standard cover ing the same subject matter . (70) Directive 2006/43/EC sets out rules on the statut ory audit of a group of under takings. Similar rules should be set out for the assurance of consolidated sustainability repor ting. (71) Directive 2006/43/EC requires statutor y auditors or audit firms to present the results of their statut ory audit in an audit repor t. Similar rules should be set out for the assurance of sustainability repor ting. The results of the assurance of sustainability repor ting should be presented in an assurance repor t. Where the same statut ory auditor carries out the statut ory audit of annual financial state ments and the assurance of sustainability repor ting, it should be possible to present the information about the assurance of sustainability repor ting in the audit repor t. (72) Directive 2006/43/EC requires Member States to set up a system of quality assurance review of statut ory auditors and audit firms. To ensure that quality assurance reviews also take place for the assurance of sustainability repor ting and that the persons who carry out quality assurance reviews have appropr iate professional education and relevant exper ience in sustainability repor ting and in the assurance of sustainability repor ting, that requirement to set up a system of quality assurance review should be extended to the assurance of sustainability repor ting. As a transitional measure, until 31 December 2025 , the persons who carry out quality assurance reviews of the assurance of sustainability repor ting should be exempted from the requirement to have relevant exper ience in sustainability repor ting and in the assurance of sustainability repor ting or in other sustainability-relate d services. (73) Directive 2006/43/EC requires Member States to have in place an investig ations and sanctions regime for statut ory auditors and audit firms carrying out statutor y audits. That Directive also requires Member States to organise an effective syste m of public oversight, and to ensure that regulatory arrangements for public oversight system s permit effective cooperation at Union level in respect of Member States’ oversight activities. Such requirements should be extende d to statutor y auditors and audit firms that conduct assurance of sustainability repor ting in order to ensure the consistency of the investig ations, sanctions and oversight framew orks set up for the auditor ’s work in the statut ory audit and the assurance of sustainability repor ting. (74) Directive 2006/43/EC contains rules on the appointment and dismissal of statut ory auditor s and audit firms carrying out statutor y audits. Those rules should be extended to the assurance of sustainability repor ting to ensure the consistency of the rules imp osed on auditors as regards their work on the statut ory audit and the assurance of sustainability repor ting. (75) Pursuant to Article 6 of Directive 2007/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (36), Member States are required to ensure that shareholders of under takings whose secur ities are admitt ed to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union, acting individually or collectively , have the right to put items on the agenda of the general meeting, provid ed that each such item is accompan ied by a justification or a draf t resolution to be adopt ed in the general meeting, and that they have the right to table draf t resolutions for items included or to be included on the agenda of a general meeting, as the case may be. Where those rights are subject to the condition that the relevant shareholder or shareholders hold a minimum stake in the under taking, such minimum stake is not to exce ed 5 % of the share capital. As regards the assurance of sustainability repor ting, shareholders should be able to exer cise the rights set (36)Directive 2007/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 on the exercise of certain rights of shareholders in listed compan ies (OJ L 184, 14.7.2007, p. 17).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 322/38 16.12.2022 

--- Page 25 of 66 ---

out in Article 6 of Directive 2007/36/EC in order to table draf t resolutions to be adopt ed in the general meeting, requir ing that, firstly , an accredit ed third party that does not belong to the same audit firm or network as the statut ory auditor or audit firm carrying out the statut ory audit prepare a repor t on certain elements of the sustainability repor ting and, secondly , that such repor t be made available to the general meeting. For under takings subject to the sustainability repor ting requirements introduced by this amending Directive and that do not fall within the scope of Article 6 of Directive 2007/36/EC, shareholders which represent more than 5 % of the votin g rights or 5 % of the capital of the under taking, acting individually or collectively , should also be given the right to table a draf t resolution to be adopt ed in the general meeting, requir ing that, firstly , an accredite d third party that does not belong to the same audit firm or netw ork as the statut ory auditor or audit firm carrying out the statut ory audit prepare a repor t on certain elements of the sustainability repor ting and, secondly , that such repor t be made available to the general meeting. (76) Directive 2006/43/EC requires Member State s to ensure that each public-interest entity has an audit committee, and specifi es its tasks with regard to the statut ory audit. That audit committee should be assigned with certain tasks with regard to the assurance of sustainability repor ting. Those tasks should include the obligation to inform the administrative or super visor y body of the public-inte rest entity of the outcome of the assurance of sustainability repor ting, and to explain how the audit committee contr ibut ed to the integr ity of sustainability repor ting and what the role of the audit committee was in that process. Member States should be able to allow functions assigned to the audit committee relating to sustainability repor ting and relating to the assurance of sustainability repor ting, to be performe d by the administrative or super visor y body as a whole or by a dedicated body established by the administrative or super visor y body . (77) Directive 2006/43/EC contains requirements for registration and oversight of third-countr y auditors and audit entities. To ensure that a consistent framewor k exists for the work of auditors in both the statutor y audit and the assurance of sustainability repor ting, it is necessar y to exte nd those requirements to the assurance of sustainability repor ting. (78) Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (37)applies to statut ory auditors and audit firms carrying out statutor y audits of public-interest entities. To ensure the independence of the statutor y auditor when carrying out a statut ory audit, that Regulation establishes a limit concer ning the fees for other services that the statutor y auditor can obtain. It is impor tant to clarify that the assurance of sustainability repor ting should not count in the calculation of that limit. In addition, Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 prohibits the provision of certain non-audit services over certain periods when the statut ory auditor is carrying out the statutor y audit. Services related to the preparation of sustainability repor ting, including any consulting services, should also be considered as prohibit ed services over the period prescr ibed in Regulation (EU) No 537/2014. The prohibition of the provision of such services should apply in all cases where the statutor y auditor carries out the statutor y audit of financial statements. To ensure the independence of the statut ory auditor , certain non-audit services should also be prohibit ed when the statut ory auditor is carrying out the assurance of sustainability repor ting. Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 requires statut ory auditors to repor t irregular ities to the audite d entity and, under certain circumstances, to author ities designate d by the Member States as responsible for investigating such irregular ities. Such oblig ation should also be extende d, as appropr iate, to statutor y auditors and audit firms as regards their work on the assurance of sustainability repor ting of public-interest entities.

(79) Directive 2004/109/EC assigns to national super visors the task of enforcing compl iance with corporat e repor ting requirements by under takings whose secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the Union. Article 4 of that Directive specifi es the content to be included in the annual financial repor ts, but lacks an explicit referen ce to Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU, whic h require the preparation of a non-financial state ment and a consolidated non-fi nancial statement. As a consequence, national compet ent author ities of some Member States have no legal mandate to super vise those non-fi nancial statements, especially where those non- financial statements are published in a separate repor t, outside of the annual financial repor t, whic h Member States may currently allow . It is theref ore necessar y to inser t into Article 4(5) of Directive 2004/109/EC a referen ce to sustainability repor ting. It is also necessar y to require that the persons responsible within the issuer confir m in the annual financial repor t that, to the best of their kno wledge, the manage ment repor t is prepared in accordance with the sustainability repor ting standards. In addition, given the novel character of the sustainability repor ting requirements, ESMA should issue guidelines for national compet ent author ities to promote converg ent super vision of sustainability repor ting by issuers subject to Directive 2004/109/EC. Those guidelines should only apply to the super vision of under takings whose secur ities are admitte d to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union. (80) In order to specify the requirements set out in this amending Directive, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delega ted to the Commission in respect of establishing sustainability repor ting standards and establishing standards for the assurance of sustainability repor ting. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropr iate consultations during its preparatory work, including at exper t level, and that those consultations be conduct ed in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 Apr il 2016 on Bett er Law-Making (38). In particular , to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegat ed acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ exper ts, and their exper ts systematically have access to meetings of Commission exper t groups dealing with the preparation of delegat ed acts. (81) The Commission should submit a repor t to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of this amending Directive, including, inter alia: an assessment of the achi evement of the goals of this amending Directive, including the converg ence of repor ting practices between Member States; an assessment of the number of small and medium-sized under takings using sustainability repor ting standards voluntar ily; an assessment of whether and how the scope of the repor ting requirements should be further exte nded, in particular in relation to small and medium-sized under takings and to third-countr y under takings operating directly on the Union internal mark et without a subsidiar y under taking or a branch on the territory of the Union; an assessment of the implementation of the repor ting requirements on subsidiar y under takings and branches of third-countr y under takings introduced by this amending Directive, including an assessment of the number of third-countr y under takings whic h have a subsidiar y under taking or a branch subject to repor ting requirements in accordance with Directive 2013/34/EU; an assessment of the enforcement mechanis m and of the relevant thresholds set out in Directive 2013/34/EU; an assessment of whether and how to ensure the accessibility for people with disabilities to the sustainability repor ting published by under takings falling under the scope of this amending Directive. The repor t on the implementation of this amending Directive should be published by 30 Apr il 2029 and ever y three years thereaf ter, and should be accompanied , if appropr iate, by legislative proposals. By 31 December 2028 , the Commission should review and repor t on the level of concentration of the sustainability assurance mark et. The review should take into account the national regimes applicable to independent assurance services provi ders and assess whether and to what extent such national regimes contr ibute to opening up the assurance market. By 31 December 2028 , the Commission should assess possible legal measures to ensure suffic ient diversification of the sustainability assurance mark et and appropr iate sustainability repor ting quality . The repor t on the level of concentration of the sustainability assurance market should be transmitted to the European Parliament and the Council by 31 December 2028 and be accompan ied, if appropr iate, by legislative proposals.

(82) Since the objectives of this amending Directive cannot be suffic iently achi eved by the Member States but can rather , by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achi eved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiar ity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of propor tionality as set out in that Article, this amending Directive does not go beyond what is necessar y in order to achi eve those objectives. (83) Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive 2013/34/EU should theref ore be amended according ly. (84) The ECB was consult ed and delivered an opinion on 7 Sept ember 2021 , HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Amendments to Directiv e 2013/34/EU Directive 2013/34/EU is amended as follows : (1) in Article 1, the followi ng paragraphs are added: ‘3.
