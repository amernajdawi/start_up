 Appendix B  
GENERIC CRITERIA FOR DNSH TO SUSTAINABLE USE AND PROTECTION OF WATER AND MARINE
RESOURCES  
Environmental degradation risks related to preserving water quality and avoiding water stress are identified and
addressed with the aim of achieving good water status and good ecological potential as defined in Article 2,
points (22) and (23), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council (  1 ) and a water use and protection management plan, developed thereunder for the 
potentially affected water body or bodies, in consultation with relevant stakeholders.  
Where an Environmental Impact Assessment is carried out in accordance with Directive 2011/92/EU of the European
Parliament and of the Council (  2 ) and includes an assessment of the impact on water in accordance with Directive 
2000/60/EC, no additional assessment of impact on water is required, provided the risks identified have been
addressed.EN  L 442/142 Official Journal of the European Union 9.12.2021  
( 1 ) Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community
action in the field of water policy (OJ L 327, 22.12.2000, p. 1).
For activities in third countries, in accordance with applicable national law or international standards which pursue equivalen t
objectives of good water status and good ecological potential, through equivalent procedural and substantive rules, i.e. a wate r
use and protection management plan developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders which ensures that 1) the impact of the  
activities on the identified status or ecological potential of potentially affected water body or bodies is assessed and 2) det erioration or
prevention of good status/ecological potential is avoided or, where this is not possible, 3) justified by the lack of better en vironmental
alternatives which are not disproportionately costly/technically unfeasible, and all practicable steps are taken to mitigate th e adverse
impact on the status of the body of water.  
( 2 ) Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on the assessment of the effects of
certain public and private projects on the environment (OJ L 26, 28.1.2012, p. 1).
