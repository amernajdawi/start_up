Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The activity complies with the following criteria:
(a) for vehicles of category M1 and N1, both falling under the scope of Regulation (EC) No 715/2007:
(i) until 31 December 2025, specific emissions of CO  2 , as defined in Article 3(1), point (h), of Regulation 
(EU) 2019/631, are lower than 50 g CO  2 /km (low- and zero-emission light-duty vehicles); 
(ii) from 1 January 2026, specific emissions of CO  2 , as defined in Article 3(1), point (h), of Regulation (EU) 
2019/631, are zero.
(b) for vehicles of category L, the tailpipe CO  2 emissions equal to 0 g CO  2 e/km calculated in accordance with the 
emission test laid down in Regulation (EU) 168/2013.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  N/A  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Vehicles of categories M1 and N1 are both of the following: 
(a) reusable or recyclable to a minimum of 85 % by weight;
(b) reusable or recoverable to a minimum of 95 % by weight (  236  ). 
Measures are in place to manage waste both in the use phase (main ­
tenance) and the end-of-life of the fleet, including through reuse and
recycling of batteries and electronics (in particular critical raw materials
therein), in accordance with the waste hierarchy.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Vehicles comply with the requirements of the most recent applicable stage 
of the Euro 6 light-duty emission type-approval (  237  ) set out in accordance 
with Regulation (EC) No. 715/2007.
Vehicles comply with the emission thresholds for clean light-duty vehicles
set out in Table 2 of the Annex to Directive 2009/33/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council (  238  ). 
For road vehicles of categories M and N, tyres comply with external rolling
noise requirements in the highest populated class and with Rolling
Resistance Coefficient (influencing the vehicle energy efficiency) in the
two highest populated classes as set out in Regulation (EU) 2020/740
and as can be verified from the European Product Registry for Energy
Labelling (EPREL).
