(4) Transition to a circular economy  The silvicultural change induced by the activity on the area covered by the 
activity is not likely to result in a significant reduction of sustainable
supply of primary forest biomass suitable for the manufacturing of
wood products with long-term circularity potential. This criterion may
be demonstrated through the climate benefits analysis referred to in
point (2).  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The activity does not use pesticides or fertilisers. 
Well documented and verifiable measures are taken to avoid the use of
active ingredients that are listed in Annex I, part A, of Regulation (EU)
2019/1021 (  65 ), the Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed consent 
procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international
trade, the Minamata Convention on Mercury, the Montreal Protocol on
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, and of active ingredients that are
listed as classification Ia (‘extremely hazardous’) or Ib (‘highly hazardous’)
in the WHO Recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard (  66 ). The 
activity complies with the relevant national law on active ingredients.
Pollution of water and soil is prevented and cleaning up measures are
undertaken when pollution occurs.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  In areas designated by the national competent authority for conservation 
or in habitats that are protected, the activity is in accordance with the
conservation objectives for those areas.
There is no conversion of habitats specifically sensitive to biodiversity loss
or with high conservation value, or of areas set aside for the restoration of
such habitats in accordance with national law.
Detailed information referred to in in point 1.2.(i) includes provisions for
maintaining and possibly enhancing biodiversity in accordance with
national and local provisions, including the following:
(a) ensuring the good conservation status of habitat and species, main ­
tenance of typical habitat species;
(b) excluding the use or release of invasive alien species;
(c) excluding the use of non-native species unless it can be demonstrated
that:
(i) the use of the forest reproductive material leads to favourable and
appropriate ecosystem conditions (such as climate, soil criteria, and
vegetation zone, forest fire resilience);
(ii) the native species currently present on the site are not anymore
adapted to projected climatic and pedo-hydrological conditions;
(d) ensuring the maintenance and improvement of physical, chemical and
biological quality of the soil;
