Stock and flow
Other environmental activities Same ratios for each of the other four environmental objectives
should be disclosed, once the screening criteria are defined. That
is: the sustainable use and protection of water and marine
resources; the transition to a circular economy; pollution
prevention and control; the protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems.
(i) GAR for lending activities to equity holdings of non-financial undertakings for loans and advances (GAR L&A)
Credit institutions shall use and disclose the following items for the calculation of the GAR for this type of exposures:
(1)(a) total loans and advances to non-financial undertakings, including loans and advances recognised under the
accounting categories referred to in point 1.2 of this Annex, that is the gross carrying amount of:
(i) loans and advances at amortised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income;
(ii) loans and advances not held for trading at fair value through profit or loss.
(1)(b) loans and advances to non-financial undertakings financing Taxonomy-eligible economic activities for each
environmental objective, including the gross carrying amount of loans and advances in the relevant accounting
categories towards companies carrying out taxonomy-eligible economic activities (where available, 4 level
Nomenclature of Economic Activities (NACE) codes) relevant for each environmental objective.
(1)(c) loans and advances to non-financial undertakings financing taxonomy-aligned economic activities for each
environmental objective, including all loans and advances financing taxonomy-aligned economic activities,
including subsets of transitional and enabling economic activities.
The amount for the purpose of (1)(c) shall be calculated by using the following formula 1(c) = (1)(c)(1) + (1)(c)(2) where:
(1)(c)(1) represents loans and advances where the use of proceeds is known, including specialised lending â€“ project finance
loans as referred to in Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 (1);
(1)(c)(2) represents loans and advances where the use of proceeds is unknown (general loans).
For the purposes of point (1)(c)(1), credit institutions shall consider the gross carrying amount of the project finance exposures to the non-financial undertaking to the extent and proportion that the project funded finances a taxonomy-
aligned economic activity. The assessment of whether that requirement has been complied with shall be based on
information provided by the counterparty on the project or activities to which the proceeds will be applied. Credit
institutions shall provide information on the type of economic activity that is funded. Double counting shall not be
allowed. Where the same specialised lending exposure is relevant for two environmental objectives, credit institutions shall
allocate it to the most relevant objective.
For the purposes of point (1)(c)(2), credit institutions shall rely on the CapEx and turnover KPI that the counterparty shall
disclose for each environmental objective in accordance with this Regulation. The amount of loans and advances to non-
financial undertakings shall be the sum of the gross carrying amount of the total loans and advances with unknown use of
proceeds to non-financial undertakings weighted by the proportion of taxonomy-aligned economic activities with a
breakdown for transition and enabling activities for each counterparty.
Credit institutions shall calculate the KPIs for those type of exposures as follows:
First step = (1)(b)/(1)(a).
