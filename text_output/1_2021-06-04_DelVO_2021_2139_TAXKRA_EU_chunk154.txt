(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Measures are in place to manage waste, both in the use phase and in the 
end-of-life of the vessel, in accordance with the waste hierarchy, including
the control and management of hazardous materials on board of ships and
ensuring their safe recycling.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Vessels comply with emission limits set out in Annex II to Regulation (EU) 
2016/1628 (including vessels meeting those limits without type-approved
solutions such as through after-treatment).  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  N/A  
6.10.  Sea and coastal freight water transport, vessels for port operations and auxiliary activities  
Description of the activity  
Purchase, financing, chartering (with or without crew) and operation of vessels designed and equipped for
transport of freight or for the combined transport of freight and passengers on sea or coastal waters, whether
scheduled or not. Purchase, financing, renting and operation of vessels required for port operations and auxiliary
activities, such as tugboats, mooring vessels, pilot vessels, salvage vessels and ice-breakers.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular H50.2, H52.22
and N77.34 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Where an economic activity in this category does not fulfil the substantial contribution criterion specified in
point 1 (a) of this Section, the activity is a transitional activity as referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU)
2020/852, provided it complies with the remaining technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. The activity complies with one or more of the following criteria:
(a) the vessels have zero direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emissions; 
(b) until 31 December 2025, hybrid and dual fuel vessels derive at least 25 % of their energy from zero direct
(tailpipe) CO  2 emission fuels or plug-in power for their normal operation at sea and in ports; 
(c) where technologically and economically not feasible to comply with the criterion in point (a), until
31 December 2025, and only where it can be proved that the vessels are used exclusively for operating
coastal and short sea services designed to enable modal shift of freight currently transported by land to sea,
the vessels have direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emissions, calculated using the International Maritime Organization 
(IMO) Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) (  246  ), 50 % lower than the average reference CO  2 emissions value 
defined for heavy duty vehicles (vehicle sub group 5-LH) in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation
2019/1242;
