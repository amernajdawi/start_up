Substantial contribution to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources
The activity leads to a retention of rainwater in a specific area or to an improvement in water quality by complying with the
following criteria:
(a) the construction and operation of the sustainable urban drainage system is integrated in the urban drainage and waste
water treatment system, as demonstrated by means of a flood risk management plan or of other relevant urban
planning tools. The activity contributes substantially to achieving the good status and good ecological potential of
bodies of surface water and groundwater or to preventing the deterioration of bodies of water that already have good
status and good potential, and is carried out to ensure compliance with Directive 2000/60/EC (11)and Directive
2008/56/EC;
(b) information is provided on the percentage of a specific area, such as a residential or commercial area, where rainwater
is not directly drained but retained within the area site;
(c) the design of the sustainable urban drainage system achieves at least one of the following effects:
(i) a quantified percentage of rainwater in the catchment area of the drainage system is retained and discharged with a
staggered delay to the receiving water bodies;
(ii) a quantified percentage of pollutants, including oil, heavy metals, hazardous chemicals and microplastics, is removed from urban runoff before discharge to the receiving water bodies;
(iii) runoff peak flow, with a return period in line with the requirements of flood risk management plans or other local
provisions in place, is reduced by a quantified percentage.
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)
(1) Climate change mitigation N/A
(2) Climate change adaptation The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.
(4) Transition to a circular
economyN/A
(5) Pollution prevention and
controlDepending on the origin of the received water and the different pollutant load, such as rainwater, rainfall run-offs from roofs, rainfall run-offs from roads, or stormwater, SUDS
treat these waters before discharging or infiltrating the water into other environmental
media.
(6)
Protection and restoration
of biodiversity and ecosys ­
temsThe activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this Annex.
The introduction of invasive alien species is prevented or their spread is managed in
accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 of the European Parliament and of
the Council (12).
(11)For activities in third countries, in accordance with applicable national law or international standards which pursue equivalent
objectives of good water status and good ecological potential, through equivalent procedural and substantive rules, i.e. a water use
and protection management plan, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders which ensures that (1) the impact of the activities on the identified status or ecological potential of potentially affected water body or bodies is assessed; and (2) deterioration or prevention of good status/ecological potential is avoided.
(12)Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the prevention and
management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species (OJ L 317, 4.11.2014, p. 35).OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
