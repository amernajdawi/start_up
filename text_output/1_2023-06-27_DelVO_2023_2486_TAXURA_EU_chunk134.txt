ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 96/1642.1. Where the activity falls within its scope, the emission limit values shall be lower than the mid-point of the BAT-AEL
ranges (26)set out in:
(a) the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste gas management and treatment systems in the
chemical sector (27)for emissions to air of new installations (or for existing installations within 4 years of the BATC
publication) where relevant conditions apply;
(b) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for Manufacture of Organic Fine Chemicals (OFC) (28); for
the manufacturing activity under conditions not covered by the BATC mentioned above;
(c) the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste water and waste gas treatment/management systems
in the chemical sector (29);
(d) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for the Large Volume Inorganic Chemicals – Solids and
Others industry (30);
(e) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for the manufacture of Large Volume Inorganic Chemicals – Ammonia, Acids and Fertilisers (
31);
(f) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for the production of speciality inorganic chemicals (SIC) for the manufacturing activity under conditions not covered by the BATC mentioned above (
32).
Plants within the BAT-AEL range(s) moving to the mid-point ambition do not trigger any significant cross-media impact.
Installations that have been granted a derogation in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 15(4) of Directive
2010/75/EU are not considered as fulfilling the technical screening criteria for the period of the derogation.
2.2. Where a continuous measurement methodology for a certain pollutant is available, the operator applies Continuous
Emission Monitoring Systems (CEMS), Continuous Effluent Quality Monitoring Systems (CEQMS) and other measures
ensuring the regular verification of non-deterioration of environment.
2.3. The operator applies solvent waste segregation for solvent recovery from concentrated waste streams, where
technically applicable.
Solvents included in Table 1 of the European Medicines Agency ICH guideline Q3C (R8) on impurities as specified in the
guideline for residual solvents (33)are avoided in medicinal products.
(26)The requirements under this point tackle the pollutants identified under the key environmental issues of each BREF document or the
BAT-AEL of the relevant BAT conclusions Commission Implementing Decisions. Where BAT-AEL differentiate between ‘existing’ and
‘new plants’, operators demonstrate compliance with BAT-AEL for new plants. When there is not a BAT-AEL range but a single value,
emission levels are below such value. When the BAT-AEL range is expressed as follows: ‘<x-y unit’ (i.e. the lower-end BAT-AEL of the range is expressed as ‘lower than’), the mid-point is calculated using x and y. Averaging periods are the same as in the BAT-AEL of the BREF documents outlined above.
