Case A: All soil stock changes are amorti zed before any further changes
occur in the ownership or management of stocks  
Cerrado is converted into a no-till crop system over the course of 75 years. While multiple shifts
in land use and farming practices occu r over this period, the resulting CO 2 fluxes are fully
amortized before any further shifts occur. Table II-2 describes the ti me series of shifts in land use
and management practices, as well as how the corresponding CO 2 fluxes are amortized. GHG
emissions inventories are prepared annually. Figu re II-1 shows how the C stocks change over
time with amortization.  Table II-2.  The amortization schedule for case A 

Figure II-1:  Changes in C stocks are fully amortized before any further shifts in management 
practices or management occur (Case A)

Case B: Not all soil stock changes are amortized be fore a further change
occurs in stock management
Same as Case A, except that the pasture is converted into a full-till crop system only 10 years
after the cerrado was first converted into pastur e (i.e., when only half of the change in carbon
stocks has been amortized). Table II-3 describe s the time series of shifts in land use and
management practices, as well as how the en suing changes in carbon stocks are amortized.
