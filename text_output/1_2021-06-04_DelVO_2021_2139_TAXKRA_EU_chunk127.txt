(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the 
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the latest relevant
best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including the best available
techniques (BAT) conclusions for large combustion plants (  195  ). No 
significant cross-media effects occur.
For combustion plants with thermal input greater than 1 MW but below
the thresholds for the BAT conclusions for large combustion plants to
apply, emissions are below the emission limit values set out in Annex II,
part 2, to Directive (EU) 2015/2193.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
4.20.  Cogeneration of heat/cool and power from bioenergy  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of installations used for cogeneration of heat/cool and power exclusively from
biomass, biogas or bioliquids, and excluding cogeneration from blending of renewable fuels with biogas or
bioliquids (see Section 4.19 of this Annex).  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular D35.11 and
D35.30 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. Agricultural biomass used in the activity complies with the criteria laid down in Article 29, paragraphs 2
to 5, of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Forest biomass used in the activity complies with the criteria laid down in
Article 29, paragraphs 6 and 7 of that Directive.
2. The greenhouse gas emission savings from the use of biomass in cogeneration installations are at least 80 %
in relation to the GHG emission saving methodology and fossil fuel comparator set out in Annex VI to Directive
(EU) 2018/2001.
3. Where the cogeneration installations rely on anaerobic digestion of organic material, the production of the
digestate meets the criteria in Sections 5.6 and criteria 1 and 2 of Section 5.7 of this Annex, as applicable.
4. Points 1 and 2 do not apply to cogeneration installations with a total rated thermal input below 2 MW and
using gaseous biomass fuels.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.
