ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 78/164(b) the packaging has been designed to be reusable within a reuse system (176). The system for reuse is established in a way
that ensures the possibility of reuse in a closed-loop or open-loop system.
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)
(1) Climate change mitigation Where the activity involves on-site generation of heat/cool or co-generation including
power, the direct GHG emissions of the activity are lower than 270 gCO 2e/kWh.
The activity develops a strategy to account for and reduce the GHG emissions arising from transport along the value chain, including shipping and returns, to the extent
these are traceable.
Where the sold product is initially produced by the activities classified under NACE
codes C29, and is a vehicle, mobility component, system, separate technical unit, part
or a spare part as defined in Regulation (EU) 2018/858, when sold in the secondary
market after 2025 and before 2030 the following criteria apply:
(a) vehicles of category M
1 and N 1 classified as light-duty vehicles comply with specific
emissions limits of CO 2, as defined in Article 3(1), point (h), of Regulation
(EU) 2019/631 of the European Parliament and of the Council (177), lower than
50 gCO 2/km (low- and zero-emission light-duty vehicles);
(b) vehicles of category L (178)with tailpipe CO 2 emissions equal to 0 g CO 2e/km
calculated in accordance with the emission test laid down in Regulation
(EU) 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (179);
(c) vehicles of categories N 2 and N 3, and N 1 classified as heavy-duty vehicles, not
dedicated to transporting fossil fuels with a technically permissible maximum laden mass not exceeding 7,5 tonnes that are ‘zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles’
as defined in Article 3, point (11), of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242;
(d) vehicles of categories N
2 and N 3 not dedicated to transporting fossil fuels with a
technically permissible maximum laden mass exceeding 7,5 tonnes that are ‘zero-
emission heavy-duty vehicles’, as defined in Article 3, point (11), of Regulation
(EU) 2019/1242 or ‘low-emission heavy-duty vehicles’ as defined in Article 3,
point (12) of that Regulation.
Where the product, initially produced by the activities classified under NACE codes C29, and being a vehicle, mobility component, system, separate technical unit, part or a spare
part as defined in Regulation (EU) 2018/858, is sold in the secondary market after 2030
specific emissions of CO
2, as defined in Article 3(1), point (h), of Regulation
(EU) 2019/631 are zero.
(176)‘Reusable’ and ‘reuse system’ are defined and implemented in accordance with the requirements on packaging reuse systems in the
Union legislation on packaging and packaging waste, including any standards related to the number of rotations in a system for reuse.
(177)Regulation (EU) 2019/631 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 setting CO 2 emission performance
standards for new passenger cars and for new light commercial vehicles, and repealing Regulations (EC) No 443/2009 and (EU)
No 510/2011 (OJ L 111, 25.4.2019, p. 13).
(178)As defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2013 on the
approval and market surveillance of two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles (OJ L 60, 2.3.2013, p. 52).
