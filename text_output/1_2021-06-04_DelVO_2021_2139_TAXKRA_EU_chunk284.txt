Agricultural biomass used for the manufacture of plastics in its primary
form complies with the criteria laid down in Article 29, paragraphs 2 to
5, of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Forest biomass used for the manufacture
of plastics in its primary form complies with the criteria laid down in
Article 29, paragraphs 6 and 7, of that Directive.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix C to this 
Annex.
Emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the relevant best
available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including:
(a) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for the
Production of Polymers (  230  ); 
(b) the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste
water and waste gas treatment/management systems in the chemical
sector (  231  ). 
No significant cross-media effects occur.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
4.  ENERGY  
4.1.  Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology  
Description of the activity  
Construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity using solar photovoltaic (PV)
technology.  
Where an economic activity is an integral element of the ‘Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy
technologies’ as referred to in Section 7.6 of this Annex, the technical screening criteria specified in Section 7.6
apply.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular D35.11 and
F42.22 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
