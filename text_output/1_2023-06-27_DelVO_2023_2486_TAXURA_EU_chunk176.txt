(a)The Code constitutes the abbreviation of the relevant objective to which the economic activity is eligible to make a substantial contribution, as well as the section number of the activity in the relevant Annex
covering the objective, i.e.:
— Climate Change Mitigation: CCM
— Climate Change Adaptation: CCA
— Water and Marine Resources: WTR
— Circular Economy: CE
— Pollution Prevention and Control: PPC
— Biodiversity and ecosystems: BIO.
For example, the Activity “Afforestation” would have the Code: CCM 1.1.
Where activities are eligible to make a substantial contribution to more than one objective, the codes for all objectives should be indicated.
For example, if the operator reports that the activity “Construction of new buildings” makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and circular economy, the code would be: CCM 7.1. / CE 3.1.
The same codes should be used in Sections A.1 and A.2 of this template.
(b)Y – Yes, Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned activity with the relevant environmental objective
N – No, Taxonomy-eligible but not Taxonomy-aligned activity with the relevant environmental objective
N/EL – Not eligible, Taxonomy-non-eligible activity for the relevant environmental objective.OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
