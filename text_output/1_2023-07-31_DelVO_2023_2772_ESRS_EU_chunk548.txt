also be linked to entities or operations outside its direct control, the undertaking may disclose whether and how it
seeks to use its leverage in its business relationships to manage those impacts. This may include using commercial
leverage (for example, enforcing contractual requirements with business relationships or implementing incentives),
other forms of leverage within the relationship (such as providing training or capacity-building on the rights of
indigenous peoples to entities with which the undertaking has a business relationships) or collaborative leverage
with peers or other actors (such as initiatives aimed at minimising security-related impacts on communities or

from pollution from a particular production facility that causes them health-related issues;
(c) ESRS E3 Water and marine sources: The undertaking may negatively impact the access to clean drinking water of
communities when withdrawing water in water stressed areas;
(d) ESRS E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems: The undertaking may negatively affect the livelihood of local farmers
through operations that contaminate soil. Additional examples include the sealing of land through building
new infrastructure, which can eradicate plant species that are critical for, for example, local biodiversity or to
filter water for communities; or the introduction of invasive species (whether plants or animals) that can
impact ecosystems and cause subsequent harm;
(e) ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy: The undertaking may negatively impact the lives of communities by
affecting their health through the mismanagement of hazardous waste.
