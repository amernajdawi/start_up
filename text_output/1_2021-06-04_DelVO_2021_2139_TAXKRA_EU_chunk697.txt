4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other
people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  367  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  368  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  The activity meets the requirements relating to sustainability, greenhouse 
gas emission savings and efficiency laid down in Article 29 of Directive
2018/2001.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  For installations falling within the scope of Directive 2010/75/EU, 
emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with
the best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the latest
relevant best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including the best
available techniques (BAT) conclusions for large combustion plants (  369  ), 
ensuring at the same time that no significant cross-media effects occur.
For combustion plants with thermal input greater than 1 MW but below
the thresholds for the BAT conclusions for large combustion plants to
apply, emissions are below the emission limit values set out in Annex II,
part 2, to Directive (EU) 2015/2193.
For plants in zones or parts of zones not complying with the air quality
limit values laid down in Directive 2008/50/EC, results of the information
exchange (  370  ), which are published by the Commission in accordance with 
Article 6, paragraphs 9 and 10 of Directive (EU) 2015/2193 are taken
into account.

( 367  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta neously 
provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse,
