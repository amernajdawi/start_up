2. For the construction and extension of a waste water treatment plant or a waste water treatment plant with
a collection system, which are substituting more GHG-intensive treatment systems (such as septic tanks,
anaerobic lagoons), an assessment of the direct GHG emissions is performed (  208  ). The results are disclosed to 
investors and clients on demand.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex. Where the waste water is treated to a level suitable for reuse in
agricultural irrigation, the required risk management actions to avoid
adverse environmental impacts have been defined and implemented (  209  ). 
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Discharges to receiving waters meet the requirements laid down in Council 
Directive 91/271/EEC (  210  ) or as required by national provisions stating 
maximum permissible pollutant levels from discharges to receiving waters.
Appropriate measures have been implemented to avoid and mitigate
excessive storm water overflows from the waste water collection system,
which may include nature-based solutions, separate storm water collection
systems, retention tanks and treatment of the first flush.
Sewage sludge is used in accordance with Council Directive
86/278/EEC (  211  ) or as required by national law relating to the spreading 
of sludge on the soil or any other application of sludge on and in the soil.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
5.4.  Renewal of waste water collection and treatment  
Description of the activity  
Renewal of centralised waste water systems including collection (sewer network) and treatment. It implies no
material change related to the load or volume of flow collected or treated in the waste water system.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE codes E37.00 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.

( 208  ) For example, following IPCC guidelines for national GHG inventories for waste water treatment (version of 4.6.2021: 
https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/pdf/5_Volume5/19R_V5_6_Ch06_Wastewater.pdf).  
( 209  ) As set out in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2020/741 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 2020 on minimum 
requirements for water reuse (OJ L 177, 5.6.2020, p. 32).  
( 210  ) Council Directive 91/271/EEC of 21 May 1991 concerning urban waste-water treatment (OJ L 135, 30.5.1991, p. 40).  
( 211  ) Council Directive 86/278/EEC of 12 June 1986 on the protection of the environment, and in particular of the soil, when sewage  
sludge is used in agriculture (OJ L 181, 4.7.1986, p. 6).EN  9.12.2021 Official Journal of the European Union L 442/93
