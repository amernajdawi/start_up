(5) Pollution prevention and control  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix C to this 
Annex.
Emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the latest relevant
best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including the best available
techniques (BAT) conclusions for iron and steel production (  118  ). 
No significant cross-media effects occur.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
3.10.  Manufacture of hydrogen  
Description of the activity  
Manufacture of hydrogen and hydrogen-based synthetic fuels.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code C20.11 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The activity complies with the life-cycle GHG emissions savings requirement of 73,4 % for hydrogen [resulting in
life-cycle GHG emissions lower than 3tCO  2 e/tH  2 ] and 70 % for hydrogen-based synthetic fuels relative to a fossil 
fuel comparator of 94 g CO  2 e/MJ in analogy to the approach set out in Article 25(2) of and Annex V to 
Directive (EU) 2018/2001.
Life-cycle GHG emissions savings are calculated using the methodology referred to in Article 28(5) of Directive
(EU) 2018/2001 or, alternatively, using ISO 14067:2018 (  119  ) or ISO 14064-1:2018 (  120  ). 
Quantified life-cycle GHG emission savings are verified in line with Article 30 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001
where applicable, or by an independent third party.
Where the CO  2 that would otherwise be emitted from the manufacturing process is captured for the purpose of 
underground storage, the CO  2 is transported and stored underground, in accordance with the technical screening 
criteria set out in Sections 5.11 and 5.12, respectively, of this Annex.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A
