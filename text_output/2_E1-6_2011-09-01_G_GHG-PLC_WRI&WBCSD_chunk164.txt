guidancerequirements
14.1 Introduction
This standard is designed to help improve the quality and consistency of product
inventories and public reporting with the ultimate goal of helping companies and
other stakeholders reduce emissions of the products they design, manufacture, sell,
purchase, and use. This step in the inventory process allows companies to set and meet
reduction targets by consistently and accurately tracking inventory changes and identifying
reduction opportunities.
14.2 Requirements
Companies can publicly report a GHG inventory in
conformance with the Product Standard  without setting a 
reduction target and tracking inventory changes. However,
companies that do set reduction targets and track
inventory changes shall abide by these requirements. To set reduction targets and track inventory changes over time, companies  shall:
• Develop and report a base inventory that
conforms with the requirements of this
standard;
 • Recalculate the base inventory when  
significant changes in the inventory
methodology occur and report those
changes;  • Complete and disclose an updated 
inventory report including the updated
results, the base inventory results, and
the context for significant changes; and
 • Use a consistent unit of analysis to  enable 
comparison and track performance over time.
