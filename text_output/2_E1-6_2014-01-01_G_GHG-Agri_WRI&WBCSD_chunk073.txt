from a windstorm ) can be reported in the year of the event . Alternatively , these emissions can be amortized ( see Chapter 8 . 3 ) . 8 . 3 Amortizing changes in carbon stocks over time What is ‘ amortizing ’ and when is it necessary ?

Shifts in management practices during the reporting period will often have long-lasting
effects on C stocks that may persist for d ecades. For instance, following a change in
management practices (e.g., adoption of no-til l practices) soil C stocks may take 15 - 60
years to reach equilibrium, depending on the type of tillage and crop rotation regimes.
Following LUC (e.g., conversion of cropland to  grassland), the transition period will 
often exceed 100 years (e.g., Figure 8-1). Also, as Figure 8-1 demonstrates, the rate of
change in C stocks will vary over time. Amortizing the CO 2 fluxes from changes in C
stocks involves allocating these fluxes across time (and therefore multiple inventories) to
ensure the more consistent acc ounting of C stock impacts.

Whether amortization is needed depends on the calculation approach  
As discussed in Chapter 7.3, a variety of methods can be used to quantify CO 2 fluxes. If a
method is used that directly estimates the amount of GHG flux (or stock change) within
the reporting period, amortizat ion is not needed. Conversely,  if the estimated data are 
generated for the transition period as a whole, rather than just for the reporting period,
amortization is needed (Table 8-1).

2 fluxes.

cumulative net CO
