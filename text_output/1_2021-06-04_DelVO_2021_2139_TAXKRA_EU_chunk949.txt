13.1.  Creative, arts and entertainment activities  
Description of the activity  
Creating, arts and entertainment activities include the provision of services to meet the cultural and entertainment
interests of their customers. This includes the production and promotion of, and participation in, live perform ­
ances, events or exhibits intended for public viewing and the provision of artistic, creative or technical skills for the
production of artistic products and live performances. These activities exclude the operation of museums of all
kinds, botanical and zoological gardens, the preservation of historical sites and nature reserves activities, gambling
and betting activities as well as sports and amusement and recreation activities.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code R90 in accordance with the statistical
classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Where an economic activity in this category complies with the substantial contribution criterion specified in
point 5, the activity is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU)
2020/852, provided that it meets the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.
