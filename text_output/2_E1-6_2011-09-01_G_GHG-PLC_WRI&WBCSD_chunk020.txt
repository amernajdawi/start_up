[28]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standardrequirements
The unit of analysis is defined as the performance
characteristics and services delivered by the product
being studied. The reference flow is the amount of
product on which the results of the study are based.
For all final products, companies shall define
the unit of analysis as a functional unit.
Final products are goods and services that are ultimately
consumed by the end user rather than used in the
production of another good or service. Since the function
of a final product is known, companies shall define
the unit of analysis as a functional unit. The functional
unit, like unit of analysis, is defined as the performance
characteristics and services delivered by the product
being studied. A defined functional unit typically includes
the function (service) a product fulfills, the duration
or service life (amount of time needed to fulfill the
function), and the expected quality level.For intermediate products where the
eventual function is unknown, companies
shall	define	the	unit	of	analysis	as	the 	
reference	flow. 	
Intermediate products are goods that are used as inputs
in the production of other goods and services. For
example, a plastic resin that is eventually transformed
into plastic car parts is an intermediate product.
In general, an intermediate product is a good that
eventually becomes a material input into the life cycle of
a final product.  Therefore, the service an intermediate 
product fulfills is often dependent on the final productâ€™s
function. When that function is unknown to the company
performing a GHG inventory on an intermediate product,
it is not always possible to define the unit of analysis as
the functional unit. In this case, companies shall define
the unit of analysis for an intermediate product as the
reference flow or amount of product being studied.
