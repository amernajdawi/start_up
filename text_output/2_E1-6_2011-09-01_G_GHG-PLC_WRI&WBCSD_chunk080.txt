13.1 Introduction
Reporting is crucial to ensure accountability and effective engagement with
stakeholders. This chapter summarizes the various reporting requirements
specified in other chapters and identifies additional reporting considerations
that together  provide a credible reporting framework and enable users of reported data 
to make informed decisions. It is essential that the reported information is based on the key
accounting principles (relevance, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and transparency).
13.2 Requirements
Companies shall publicly report the
following information to be in conformance
with the GHG Protocol Product Standard:
General information and scope
• Contact information;
• Studied product name and description;
• The unit of analysis and reference flow;
 •Type of inventory, cradle-to-grave or  
    cradle-to-gate;   • Additional GHGs included in the 
inventory;
 •	Any	product	rules	or	sector-specific 	
guidance used;
•Inventory date and version;
• For subsequent inventories, a link
to previous inventory reports and
description of any methodological
changes; and
 • A disclaimer stating the limitations  
of various potential uses of the report
including product comparison.

[102]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standardrequirements
Boundary setting
 •	Life	cycle	stage	definitions	and 	
descriptions;
• A process map including attributable
processes in the inventory;
 • Non-attributable processes included  
in the inventory;
 • Excluded attributable processes  
and	justification	for	their	exclusion; 	
 •	Justification	of	a	cradle-to-gate 	
boundary, when applicable;
•The time period; and
• The method use to calculate land-use
change impacts, when applicable.
Allocation
 •	Disclosure	and	justification	of	the 	
methods used to avoid or perform
allocation due to co-products or
recycling; and
• When using the closed loop
approximation method, any displaced
emissions and removals separately  
from the end-of-life stage.
Data collection and quality
 •	For	significant	processes,	a	descriptive 	
statement on the data sources, data
quality,	and	any	efforts	taken	to	improve 	
data quality.
Uncertainty
• A qualitative statement on inventory
uncertainty and methodological choices.
Methodological choices include:
•Use and end-of-life profile;
• Allocation methods, including allocation
due to recycling;
• Source of global warming potential
(GWP) factors used;
•Calculation models.
Inventory results
 • The source and date of the GWP  
factors used;
• Total inventory results in units of CO2e
per unit of analysis, which includes all
emissions and removals included in  
the boundary from biogenic sources,  
non-biogenic sources, and land-use
change impacts;
• Percentage of total inventory results by
life cycle stage;
 •	Biogenic	and	non-biogenic	emissions	and 	
removals separately when applicable;
• Land use impacts separately when
applicable;
• Cradle-to-gate and gate-to-gate
inventory results separately (or a clear
statement	that	confidentiality	is	a 	
limitation to providing this information);
• The amount of carbon contained in the
product or its components that is not
released to the atmosphere during waste
treatment, when applicable; and
• For cradle-to-gate inventories, the
amount of carbon contained in the
intermediate product.
