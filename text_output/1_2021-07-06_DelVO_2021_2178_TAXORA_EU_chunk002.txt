COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2021/2178
of 6 July 2021
supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council by
specifying the content and presentation of information to be disclosed by undertakings subject to
Articles 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU concerning environmentally sustainable economic
activities, and specifying the methodology to comply with that disclosure obligation
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the
establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (1), and in
particular Article 8(4), thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 requires undertakings that are subject to Articles 19a or 29a of Directive
2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (2)to disclose how and to what extent their activities
are associated with environmentally sustainable economic activities. Article 8(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 requires non-financial undertakings to disclose information on the proportion of the turnover, capital expenditure
and operating expenditure (‘key performance indicators’) of their activities related to assets or processes associated
with environmentally sustainable economic activities. That provision, however, does not specify equivalent key
performance indicators for financial undertakings, that is credit institutions, asset managers, investment firms and
insurance and reinsurance undertakings. It is therefore necessary to supplement Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 to specify the key performance indicators for financial undertakings and further specify the content and
presentation of the information to be disclosed by all undertakings and the methodology to comply with that
disclosure.
(2) It is necessary to ensure a uniform application of the disclosure requirements laid down in Article 8(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 by non-financial undertakings that are subject to Articles 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU. Rules
should therefore be laid down to further specify the content and presentation of the information required by
Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, including the methodology to comply with those rules. To enable investors and the public to properly assess the proportion of environmentally sustainable economic activities (‘Taxonomy-
aligned activities’) of non-financial undertakings, those undertakings should be required to disclose which of their
economic activities are Taxonomy-aligned. In addition, it is necessary to disclose to which environmental objectives
those activities contribute substantially. Non-financial undertakings should therefore also provide for a breakdown
in the key performance indicators of the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned activities based on each environmental objective to which those activities contribute substantially.
(3) Turnover, capital expenditure and operating expenditure are irrelevant for assessing the environmental sustainability of financial activities, including lending, investment and insurance. The three key performance indicators for non-
financial undertakings laid down in Article 8(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 are therefore not appropriate to
demonstrate to what extent the economic activities of financial undertakings are -Taxonomy-aligned. It is therefore
necessary to provide specific key performance indicators and calculation methodologies for such key performance
indicators for financial undertakings. To support markets’ understanding of those key performance indicators, any disclosures of those key performance indicators should be accompanied by qualitative information to enable
financial undertakings to explain their determination of key performance indicators.

in the financial services sector (OJ L 317, 9.12.2019, p. 1).
(2)Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements,
consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the
