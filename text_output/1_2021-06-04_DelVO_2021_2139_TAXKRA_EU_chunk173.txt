Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The building renovation complies with the applicable requirements for major renovations (  298  ). 
Alternatively, it leads to a reduction of primary energy demand (PED) of at least 30 % (  299  ). 
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  Where installed as part of the renovation works, except for renovation 
works in residential building units, the specified water use for the
following water appliances is attested by product datasheets, a building
certification or an existing product label in the Union, in accordance with
the technical specifications laid down in Appendix E to this Annex:
(a) wash hand basin taps and kitchen taps have a maximum water flow of
6 litres/min;
(b) showers have a maximum water flow of 8 litres/min;
(c) WCs, including suites, bowls and flushing cisterns, have a full flush
volume of a maximum of 6 litres and a maximum average flush
volume of 3,5 litres;
(d) urinals use a maximum of 2 litres/bowl/hour. Flushing urinals have a
maximum full flush volume of 1 litre.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  At least 70 % (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and 
demolition waste (excluding naturally occurring material referred to in
category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by
Decision 2000/532/EC) generated on the construction site is prepared
for reuse, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling oper ­
ations using waste to substitute other materials, in accordance with the
waste hierarchy and the EU Construction and Demolition Waste
Management Protocol (  300  ). Operators limit waste generation in processes 
related construction and demolition, in accordance with the EU
Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol and taking
into account best available techniques and using selective demolition to
enable removal and safe handling of hazardous substances and facilitate
reuse and high-quality recycling by selective removal of materials, using
available sorting systems for construction and demolition waste.  
_____________
( 298  ) As set in the applicable national and regional building regulations for ‘major renovation’ implementing Directive 2010/31/EU.  The 
energy performance of the building or the renovated part that is upgraded meets cost-optimal minimum energy performance
requirements in accordance with the respective directive.
( 299  ) The initial primary energy demand and the estimated improvement is based on a detailed building survey, an energy audit 
conducted by an accredited independent expert or any other transparent and proportionate method, and validated through an
Energy Performance Certificate. The 30 % improvement results from an actual reduction in primary energy demand (where the
reductions in net primary energy demand through renewable energy sources are not taken into account), and can be achieved
through a succession of measures within a maximum of three years.
