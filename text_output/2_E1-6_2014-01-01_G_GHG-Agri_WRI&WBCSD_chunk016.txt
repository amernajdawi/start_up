The revenue from offset credits  is often mentioned as a leading reason for why 
agricultural companies should become interested in managing their GHG fluxes. Soil C
sequestration, in particular, is considered an  important potential source of offset credits 
because it offers most (~89%) of the global potential for reducing the emissions from
agriculture (Smith et al., 2007b). The Corporat e Standard, and therefore this Guidance,
do not address the accounting steps needed to cr eate offset credits from soils, biomass or
other sources located on farms. For exampl e, this Guidance does not consider the
permanence of C sequestration. Instead, fluxes to/from C stocks are simply reported as
they occur (or projected to occur5) and there is no considera tion of policy measures to
ensure the permanence of sequestered C (e.g., insurance mechanisms, project buffers, etc.). For such guidance reader s should instead refer to the Project Protocol and its
companion document, the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry Guidance for GHG
Project Accounting .  
1.8  How was this Guidance developed?   
This Guidance is the culmination of an intern ational, three-year st akeholder consultation
process that involved over 150 Techni cal Working Group (TWG) members from
businesses, government agencies, NGOs, and acad emic institutions. Milestones include:
 January, 2011: Publicatio n of WRI Working Paper
 March, 2011: Formation of TWG
 January, 2012: First draft of Guidance
 April, 2012: Stakeholder workshop in Washington, DC
 August, 2012: Second draft of Guidance
 September, 2012: TWG workshop in Sao Paulo
 January, 2013: TWG workshop in Sao Paulo
 March – August, 2013: Road testin g and public open comment period
 October, 2013: Third draft of Guidance  

5 Chapter 8 describes how projected changes in C stocks can be calculated and reflected in inventories.

 Chapter 2: Business goals  
The development of a GHG inventory can be a significant undertaking. Companies
should therefore have clearly defined goals for managing their GHG fluxes and
understand how inventories will allow them to  meet those goals. Companies generally 
want their GHG inventories to be capable of  serving multiple goals. It therefore makes 
sense to design the inventory process from th e outset to provide information for a variety
of different users and uses – both current and future.  

This chapter:
 Reviews the various goals that GHG emi ssions inventories can help companies
meet.  
 Describes the potential economic and envi ronmental benefits from a range of
GHG reduction measures.

2.1 Overview of business goals
Agricultural companies can have diverse reasons for developing inventories. These
reasons generally involve (Table 2-1):
 Identifying opportunities to reduce GHG emissi ons (or sequester C), setting baselines
and reduction targets, and tracking performance.  
 Identifying opportunities to reduce costs a nd increase productivity  (e.g., conservation 
tillage and cover cropp ing can help to reduce fertilizer and fuel costs; Table 2-2).  
 Managing reputational risks and opportuni ties associated wi th agricultural GHG
fluxes (e.g., meeting the requirements of buye rs such as processors and food and
drink companies, and repo rting to civil society).
 A desire to sustain farmlands for future generations.

GHG emissions reduction measures may also offer co-benefits such as:
 Reduced erosion and land degradation
 Reduced phosphorous (P) and nitrogen (N) runoff  
 Improved water quality and retention
 Control of air pollutants (e.g, ammonia and hydrogen sulphide)
 Increased soil fertility
