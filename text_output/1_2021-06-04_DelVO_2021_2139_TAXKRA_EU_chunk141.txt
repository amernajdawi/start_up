(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  N/A  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  For composting plants treating over 75 tonnes per day, emissions to air 
and water are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out for aerobic treatment of
waste in the latest relevant best available techniques (BAT) conclusions,
including the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for waste treat ­
ment (  219  ). No significant cross-media effects occur. 
The site has a system in place that prevents leachate reaching groundwater.
The compost produced meets the requirements for fertilising materials set
out in Component Material Category 3 in Annex II to Regulation (EU)
2019/1009 or national rules on fertilisers or soil improvers for agricultural
use.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
5.9.  Material recovery from non-hazardous waste  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of facilities for the sorting and processing of separately collected non-hazardous waste
streams into secondary raw materials involving mechanical reprocessing, except for backfilling purposes.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E38.32 and
F42.99 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No
1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The activity converts at least 50 %, in terms of weight, of the processed separately collected non-hazardous waste
into secondary raw materials that are suitable for the substitution of virgin materials in production processes.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  N/A
