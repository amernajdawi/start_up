(h) vehicles of category N2 and N3, and N1classified as heavy-duty vehicles, not dedicated to transporting fossil
fuels with a technically permissible maximum laden mass not exceeding 7,5 tonnes that are ‘zero-emission
heavy-duty vehicles’ as defined in Regulation (EU) 2019/1242;  
(i) vehicles of category N2 and N3 not dedicated to transporting fossil fuels with a technically permissible
maximum laden mass exceeding 7,5 tonnes that are zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles’, as defined in
Article 3, point (11), of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 or ‘low-emission heavy-duty vehicles’ as defined in
Article 3, point (12) of that Regulation;  
(j) inland passenger water transport vessels that:  
(i) have zero direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emissions;  
(ii) until 31 December 2025, are hybrid or dual fuel vessels using at least 50 % of their energy from zero
direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emission fuels or plug-in power for their normal operation;  
(k) inland freight water transport vessels, not dedicated to transporting fossil fuels, that:  
(i) have zero direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emission;  
(ii) until 31 December 2025, have direct (tailpipe) emissions of CO  2 per tonne kilometre (g CO  2 /tkm), 
calculated (or estimated in case of new vessels) using the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (  94 ), 
50 % lower than the average reference value for emissions of CO  2 defined for heavy duty vehicles 
(vehicle subgroup 5- LH) in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242;  
(l) sea and coastal freight water transport vessels, vessels for port operations and auxiliary activities, that are not
dedicated to transporting fossil fuels, that:  
(i) have zero direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emissions;  
(ii) until 31 December 2025, are hybrid and dual fuel vessels that derive at least 25 % of their energy from
zero direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emission fuels or plug-in power for their normal operation at sea and in ports;  
(iii) until 31 December 2025, and only where it can be proven that the vessels are used exclusively for
operating coastal and short sea services designed to enable modal shift of freight currently transported
by land to sea, the vessels that have direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emissions, calculated using the International 
Maritime Organization (IMO) Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) (  95 ), 50 % lower than the average 
reference CO  2 emissions value defined for heavy duty vehicles (vehicle subgroup 5-LH) in accordance with 
Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242;  
(iv) until 31 December 2025, the vessels have an attained Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) value 10 %
below the EEDI requirements applicable on 1 April 2022 (  96 ) if the vessels are able to run on zero direct 
(tailpipe) CO  2 emission fuels or on fuels from renewable sources (  97 ); 
(m) sea and coastal passenger water transport vessels, not dedicated to transporting fossil fuels, that:  
(i) have zero direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emissions;  
(ii) until 31 December 2025, hybrid and dual fuel vessels derive at least 25 % of their energy from zero direct
(tailpipe) CO  2 emission fuels or plug-in power for their normal operation at sea and in ports;EN  9.12.2021 Official Journal of the European Union L 442/181  
( 94 ) The Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator is defined as the ratio of mas of CO  2 emitted per unit of transport work. It is a 
representative value of the energy efficiency of the ship operation over a consistent period which represents the overall tradi ng
pattern of the vessel. Guidance on how to calculate this indicator is provided in the document MEPC.1/Circ. 684 from IMO.
