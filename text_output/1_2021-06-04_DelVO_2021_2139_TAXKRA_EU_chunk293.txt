(b) measures to ensure minimum ecological flow (including mitigation of
rapid, short-term variations in flow or hydro-peaking operations) and
sediment flow;
(c) measures to protect or enhance habitats.
2.3. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of
the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving
good status or potential of the affected water body.
3. For construction of new hydropower plants, the activity complies
with the following criteria:
3.1. In accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2000/60/EC and in
particular paragraph 7 of that Article, prior to construction, an impact
assessment of the project is carried out to assess all its potential impacts
on the status of water bodies within the same river basin and on protected
habitats and species directly dependent on water, considering in particular
migration corridors, free-flowing rivers or ecosystems close to undisturbed
conditions.
The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data,
including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are
specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the
expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as
compared to its current one.
It assesses in particular the cumulated impacts of this new project with
other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin.
3.2. On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that
the plant is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures,
so that it complies with one of the following requirements:
(a) the plant does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the
achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it
relates to;
(b) where the plant risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement of
good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such
deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-
benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following:
(i) the reasons of overriding public interest or the fact that benefits
expected from the planned hydropower plant outweigh the costs
from deteriorating the status of water that are accruing to the
environment and to society;
(ii) the fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected
from the plant cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or dispro Â­
portionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that would lead
to a better environmental outcome (such as refurbishing of existing
hydropower plants or use of technologies not disrupting river
continuity).EN  L 442/222 Official Journal of the European Union 9.12.2021
