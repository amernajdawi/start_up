(ii) the most recent business-as-usual practices prior to the start of the activity;
(iii) the practices corresponding to a management system ensuring that carbon stocks and sinks levels in
the forest area are maintained or strengthened over the long term as set out in Article 29(7),
point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.
(c) the resolution of the analysis is proportionate to the size of the area concerned and values specific to the area
concerned are used.
(d) emissions and removals that occur due to natural disturbances, such as pests and diseases infestations, forest
fires, wind, storm damages, that impact the area and cause underperformance do not result in non-
compliance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852, provided that the climate benefit analysis is consistent with
the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories regarding
emissions and removals due to natural disturbances.
2.4. Forest holdings under 13ha are not required to perform a climate benefit analysis.
3. Guarantee of permanence  
3.1. In accordance with national law, the forest status of the area in which the activity takes place is guaranteed
by one of the following measures:
(a) the area is classified in the permanent forest estate as defined by the FAO (  36 ); 
(b) the area is classified as a protected area;
(c) the area is the subject of any legal or contractual guarantee ensuring that it will remain a forest.
3.2. In accordance with national law, the operator of th e activity commits that future updates to the forest
management plan or equivalent instrument, beyond the activity that is financed, will continue to seek the climate
benefits as determined in point 2. Besides, the operator of the activity commits to compensate any reduction in
the climate benefit determined in point 2 with an equivalent climate benefit resulting from the conduct of an
activity that corresponds to one of the forestry activities defined in this Regulation.
4. Audit  
Within two years after the beginning of the activity and every 10 years thereafter, the compliance of the activity
with the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation criteria and the DNSH criteria are verified by either
of the following:
(a) the relevant national competent authorities;
(b) an independent third-party certifier, at the request of national authorities or the operator of the activity.
In order to reduce costs, audits may be performed together with any forest certification, climate certification or
other audit.
The independent third-party certifier may not have any conflict of interest with the owner or the funder, and may
not be involved in the development or operation of the activity.
5.Group assessment  
The compliance with the criteria for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and with DNSH criteria
may be checked:
(a) at the level of the forest sourcing area (  37 ) as defined in Article 2, point (30), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001;  
_____________
( 36 ) Forest area that is designated to be retained as forest and may not be converted to other land use,
(FAO Global Resources Assessment 2020. Terms and definitions  version of 4.6.2021: http://www.fao.org/3/I8661EN/i8661en.pdf). 
( 37 ) ‘Sourcing area’ means the geographically defined area from which the forest biomass feedstock is sourced, from which reliable  and 
independent information is available and where conditions are sufficiently homogeneous to evaluate the risk of the sustainabili ty
and legality characteristics of the forest biomass.EN  9.12.2021 Official Journal of the European Union L 442/25
