ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 91/164(c) the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste water and waste gas treatment/management systems
in the chemical sector (10);
(d) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for the Large Volume Inorganic Chemicals – Solids and
Others industry (11);
(e) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for the manufacture of Large Volume Inorganic Chemicals – Ammonia, Acids and Fertilisers (
12);
(f) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for the production of speciality inorganic chemicals (SIC) (
13); for the manufacturing activity under conditions not covered by the BATC mentioned above.
Plants within the BAT-AEL range(s) moving to the mid-point ambition do not trigger any significant cross-media impact. Installations that have been granted a derogation in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 15(4) of Directive
2010/75/EU are not considered as fulfilling the technical screening criteria for the period of the derogation.
2.2. Where a continuous measurement methodology for a certain pollutant is available, the operator applies Continuous
Emission Monitoring Systems (CEMS), Continuous Effluent Quality Monitoring Systems (CEQMS) and other measures
ensuring the regular verification of non-deterioration of environment.
2.3. The operator applies solvent waste segregation for solvent recovery from concentrated waste streams, where
technically applicable.
Solvents included in Table 1 of the European Medicines Agency ICH guideline Q3C (R8) on impurities: guideline for
residual solvents (
14)are avoided.
The maximum solvents loss from total inputs does not exceed a 3 % loss. Total volatile organic compound (VOC) recovery
efficiency is at least 99 %.
The operator verifies that no fugitive VOC emission occurs beyond the criteria specified below as to the parts per million
volumetric (ppmv) thresholds by carrying out Leak detection and repair (LDAR) campaigns, at least every 3 years.
Investments for the use of high integrity equipment are recommended, provided that these are installed in existing plants
for cases mentioned under BAT 23 point (b) of the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste gas
management and treatment systems in the chemical sector (WGC), whereas the pressure threshold is brought to 200 bar.
The minimal verification schedule may be reduced in cases where quantification of total VOC emissions from the plant is
periodically qualified with tracer correlation (TC) or with optical absorption-based techniques, such as differential
absorption light detection and ranging (DIAL) or solar occultation flux (SOX) or other measures of equivalent performance.
Diffuse emissions of substances or mixtures classified as CMR1A or 1B from leaky equipment do not exceed a
concentration of 100 ppmv (15).

Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, for common waste water and waste gas treatment/management
systems in the chemical sector (OJ L 152, 9.6.2016, p. 23).
