GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 101 functionally more useful. On-farm product processing is product processing done on the farm with produce from the farm. Rolling base period Base periods that move forward in time with each reporting period. Ruminants Mammals that digest plant-based f ood by softening it within a first stomach (the ‘rumen’), then regurgitating the semi-digested mass (the ‘cud’) for further chewing. Enteric fermentation results from the microbial fermentation of food in the rumen. Examples of ruminants include cattle, goats, sheep, bison, yaks, water buffalo, and deer. Scope Defines the operational boundaries in relation to direct and indirect GHG emissions. Scope 1 Direct GHG emissions from sources owned or controlled by the reporting company. Scope 2 Emissions associated with the generation of electricity, heating/ cooling, or steam purchased for the reporting company’s own consumption. Scope 3 Indirect emissions other than those covered in scope 2 . Timberbelt Multiple row field windbreaks that are planted with commercially valuable, fast-growing trees (such as hybrid poplar or hybrid willow) to provide conservation benefits, improve adjacent crop yields, diversify on-farm income sources, and produce commercially valuable wood products. Volatilization of soil nitrogen The vaporization of soil NH 3 and NO X and their subsequent release into the atmosphere.
