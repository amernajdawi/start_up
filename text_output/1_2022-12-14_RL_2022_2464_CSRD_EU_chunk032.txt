(34) It is not the objective of this amending Directive to require under takings to disclose intellectual capital, intellectual
proper ty, know-ho w or the results of innovati on that would qualify as trade secrets as defined in Directive (EU)
2016/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council (22). Repor ting requirements provided for in this
amending Directive should theref ore be without prejudice to Directive (EU) 2016/943.
(35) Article 19a(1) and Article 29a(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU require under takings to include in their non-financial
repor ting references to, and additional explanations of, amounts repor ted in the annual financial statements. Those
Articles do not, however , require under takings to make references to other information in the management repor t
or to add additional explanations to that information. Thus, there is currently a lack of consist ency between non-
financial information repor ted and the rest of the information disclosed in the management repor t. It is necessar y
to lay down clear requirements in this regard.
(36) Article 19a(1) and Article 29a(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU require under takings to provid e a clear and reasoned
explanation for not pursuing policies in relation to one or more of the matt ers listed in those Articles, where the
under taking does not do so. The differ ent treatment of disclosures on the policies that under takings may have,
compare d to the other repor ting areas included in those Articles, has created confusion among repor ting
under takings and has not helped to improve the quality of the repor ted information. Theref ore, there is no need to
maintain such different treatment of policies in that Directive. The sustainability repor ting standards should
determine what information needs to be disclosed in relation to each of the repor ting areas mentioned in Articles
19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU as amended by this amending Directive.
(37) Under takings that fall under the scope of Article 19a(1) and Article 29a(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU may rely on
national, Union-based or international repor ting frameworks, and where they do so, they have to specify which
framewor ks they have relied upon. However , Directive 2013/34/EU does not require under takings to use a
common repor ting framewor k or standard, and it does not prevent under takings from choosing not to use any
repor ting framew ork or standards at all. As required by Article 2 of Directive 2014/95/EU, on 5 July 2017 , the
Commission adopt ed a Communication entitled ‘Guidelines on non-financial repor ting (methodology for repor ting
non-fi nancial information)’ (‘Guidelines on non-f inancial repor ting’), provi ding for non-binding guidelines for
under takings that fall under the scope of that Directive.
On 17 June 2019 , the Commission adopt ed its Guidelines on repor ting climat e-relat ed information, containing
additional guidelines, specifi cally on repor ting climate -related information. Those Guidelines on repor ting climat e-
relat ed information explicitly incor porat ed the recommendations of the Task Force on Climat e-related Financial
Disclosures. Available evidence indicates that the Guidelines on non-fi nancial repor ting did not have a signif icant
imp act on the quality of non-fi nancial repor ting by under takings under the scope of Articles 19a and 29a of
Directive 2013/34/EU. The volun tary nature of the guidelines means that under takings are free to decide whether
to apply them or not. The guidelines can theref ore not ensure on their own the comparab ility of the information
disclosed by different under takings, or the disclosure of all information that users of that information consider
relevant. That is why there is a need for mandatory common sustainability repor ting standards to ensure that
information is compara ble and that all relevant information is disclosed. Building on the double mater iality
principle, standards should cover all information that is mater ial to users of that information. Common
