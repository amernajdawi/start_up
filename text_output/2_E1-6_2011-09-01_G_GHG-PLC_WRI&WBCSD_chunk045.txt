CHAPTER 08 Collecting Data and Assessing Data Quality
guidanceData quality indicators and methods
The five data quality indicators used to assess individual
data points for processes in the product inventory are
listed in table 8.1.
There are multiple methods for using indicators to
assess data quality, including the qualitative data quality
assessment method outlined in this standard. Regardless
of the method used, companies should document the
approach and results in the data management plan to
support the assurance process, ensure internal inventory
quality controls, and track data quality improvements
over time.
Improving the quality of data for large emission sources can
result in a significant improvement in the overall inventory quality. Therefore, if resource constraints exist, companies
should focus data assessment and subsequent collection of
higher quality data on the largest sources of emissions.  
Qualitative data quality assessment
The qualitative data quality assessment approach applies
scoring criteria to each of the data quality indicators. This
rating system has elements of subjectivity. For example,
some fuel emission factors do not change significantly
over time. Therefore, a fuel emission factor that is over
10 years old, which would be assigned a temporal score
of ‘poor’ with the data quality in table 8.2, may not be
different from a factor less than 6 years old (a ‘good’
temporal score). Companies should consider the individual
circumstances of the data when using the data quality
Indicator Description Relation to data quality
Technological
representativenessThe degree to which the data reflects  
the actual technology(ies) usedCompanies should select data that  
are technologically specific.
Temporal
representativenessThe degree to which the data reflects  
the actual time (e.g., year) or age of  
the activity Companies should select data that  
are temporally specific.
Geographical
representativenessThe degree to which the data reflects  
the actual geographic location of the
activity (e.g., country or site)Companies should select data that  
are geographically specific.
Completeness The degree to which the data are
statistically representative of the  
relevant activity.
Completeness includes the percentage  
of locations for which data is available  
and used out of the total number that  
relate to a specific activity. Complete -
ness also addresses seasonal and other
normal fluctuations in data.Companies should select data that  
are complete.
Reliability The degree to which the sources, data
collection methods and verification
procedures3 used to obtain the data are
dependable.Companies should select data that are
reliable.Table [8.1]    Data quality indicators
