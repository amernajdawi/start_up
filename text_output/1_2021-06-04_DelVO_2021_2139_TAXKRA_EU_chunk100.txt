(e) ethylene oxide;  
(f) monoethylene glycol;  
(g) adipic acid.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code C20.14 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is a transitional activity as referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU)
2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
GHG emissions (  136  ) from the organic basic chemicals production processes are lower than: 
(a) for HVC: 0,693 (  137  ) tCO  2 e/t of HVC; 
(b) for aromatics: 0,0072 (  138  ) tCO  2 e/t of complex weighted throughput; 
(c) for vinyl chloride: 0,171 (  139  ) tCO  2 e/t of vinyl chloride; 
(d) for styrene: 0,419 (  140  ) tCO  2 e/t of styrene; 
(e) for ethylene oxide/ethylene glycols: 0,314 (  141  ) tCO  2 e/t of ethylene oxide/glycol; 
(f) for adipic acid: 0,32 (  142  ) tCO  2 e /t of adipic acid. 
Where the organic chemicals in scope are produced wholly or partially from renewable feedstock, the life-cycle
GHG emissions of the manufactured chemical, manufactured wholly or partially from renewable feedstock, are
lower than the life-cycle GHG emissions of the equivalent chemical manufactured from fossil fuel feedstock.
Life-cycle GHG emissions are calculated using Recommendation 2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using
ISO 14067:2018 (  143  ) or ISO 14064-1:2018 (  144  ). 
Quantified life-cycle GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party.
Agricultural biomass used for the manufacture of organic basic chemicals complies with the criteria laid down in
Article 29, paragraphs 2 to 5 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Forest biomass used for the manufacture of organic
basic chemicals complies with the criteria laid down in Article 29, paragraphs 6 and 7 of that Directive.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.
