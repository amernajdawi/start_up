GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance

Appendix I: Performance metrics
The Corporate Standard and this Guidance only require the reporting of absolute GHG
flux data. GHG performance metrics do not have to be reported. However, they can provide important insights  into a company’s GHG performance and are generally 
recommended as part of an effective GHG reporting and management system. For instance, they can be used to:
 Evaluate performance over time (e.g., compare figures from different years, identify
trends in data, and show performance in  relation to targets and base periods). 
 Improve comparability between different sizes of operations by normalizing figures
(e.g., by assessing the impact of differently sized operations on the same scale).  
This Appendix:
 Summarizes the various types of GH G performance metrics that exist.
 Provides general recommendations for the calcula tion, use, and reporting of metrics.
