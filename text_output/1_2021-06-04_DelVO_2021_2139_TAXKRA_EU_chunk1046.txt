4. The economic activity has the potential to reduce material impacts due to climate risks identified through a
robust climate risk assessment in another economic activity through the development, research, or innovation of
solutions, technologies, products, processes or business models, the risk reduction potential of which has at least
been demonstrated in an operational environment (  639  ) at pre-commercial scale and are further substantiated 
through at least one of the following elements:
(a) the first use of a patent not older than 10 years associated with the solution, technology, product, process or
business model;
(b) other forms of intellectual property rights associated with the solution, technology, product, process or
business model, such as trade secrets, trademarks or copyrights;
(c) a permit obtained from a competent authority for operating the demonstration site associated with the
solution, technology, product, process or business model for the duration of the demonstration project.
5. The economic activity uses state-of-art climate projections and assessment of impacts, the best available
science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in accordance with the most recent Inter ­
governmental Panel on Climate Change reports and scientific peer-reviewed publications as a benchmark for the
solutions, technologies, products, processes or business models it develops.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  The activity is not undertaken for the purposes of fossil fuel extraction, 
transport or use.
The projected life-cycle GHG emissions from the researched technology,
product or other solution do not undermine GHG mitigation objectives
under the Paris Agreement or hinder the deployment of climate mitigation
solutions.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  Any potential risks to the good status or the good ecological potential of 
bodies of water, including surface water and groundwater, or to the good
environmental status of marine waters from the researched technology,
product or other solution are evaluated and addressed.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Any potential risks to the circular economy objectives from the researched
