6. Resource use is a major driver of other environmental impacts such as climate change, pollution, water and marine
resources and biodiversity. A circular economy is a system that tends towards sustainable use of resources in
extraction, processing, production, consumption and management of waste. Such system brings multiple
environmental benefits, in particular, the reduction of material and energy consumption and emissions into the air
(greenhouse gas emissions or other pollution), the limitation of water withdrawals and discharges and the
regeneration of nature limiting the impact on biodiversity.
7. To provide a comprehensive overview of which other environmental matters could be material to resource use and
circular economy, relevant disclosure requirements are covered in other environmental ESRS as follows:
(a) ESRS E1 Climate change, which addresses, in particular, GHG emissions and energy resources (energy
consumption);
(b) ESRS E2 Pollution, which addresses, in particular, emissions to water, air and soil as well as substances of concern;
(83)Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives
