4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people,
of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  410  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  411  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  A monitoring plan is in place for methane leakage at the facility.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the 
best available technique (BAT-AEL) ranges set for anaerobic treatment of
waste in the latest relevant best available techniques (BAT) conclusions,
including the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for waste treat ­
ment (  412  ). No significant cross-media effects occur. 
Where the resulting digestate is intended for use as fertiliser or soil
improver, its nitrogen content (with tolerance level ± 25 %) is
communicated to the buyer or the entity in charge of taking off the
digestate.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
5.7.  Anaerobic digestion of bio-waste  
Description of the activity  
Construction or operation of dedicated facilities for the treatment of separately collected bio-waste (  413  ) through 
anaerobic digestion with the resulting production and utilisation of biogas and digestate or chemicals.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E38.21 and
F42.99 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
___________  
( 410  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta neously 
provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nat ure
and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and syste mic
interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosystem service s
