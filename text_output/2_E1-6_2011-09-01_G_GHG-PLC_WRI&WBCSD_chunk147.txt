Assurers are defined as person(s) providing assurance
over the product inventory and shall be independent
of any involvement in the determination of the product
inventory or development of any declaration. Assurers
shall have no conflicts of interests, such that they can
exercise objective and impartial judgment. Inherently, assurance provided by a third party offers
a higher degree of objectivity and independence.
Companies receiving first party assurance are required
to report how potential conflicts of interests were
avoided during the assurance process (see the assurance
statement reporting requirement below for more
information). Typical threats to independence may
include financial and other conflicts of interest between
the reporting company and the assurer. These threats
should be assessed throughout the assurance process.
Companies shall report the assurance
statement in the inventory report. The
statement shall include:
 • Whether the assurance was performed  
by	a	first	or	third	party 	
• The level of assurance achieved (limited
or reasonable) including assurance
opinion or the critical review findings
•A summary of the assurance process
 • The relevant competencies of  
the assurers
 •	How	any	potential	conflicts	of	interest 	
were avoided for first party assurance
