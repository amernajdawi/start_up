[86]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard
requirements
In addition to the total inventory results,
companies shall quantify and report:
 • Percentage of total inventory results  
by life cycle stage
 •	Biogenic	and	non-biogenic	emissions	and 	
removals separately when applicable
• Land-use change impacts separately
when applicable
• Cradle-to-gate and gate-to-gate
inventory results separately or a clear
statement	that	confidentiality	is	a 	
limitation to providing this information
Separately calculating and reporting these components of
the inventory results adds transparency to the product’s
life cycle and provides companies and their stakeholders with a better understanding of what type of emissions
and removals dominate the inventory and where they
occur along the life cycle.
Companies shall not include the following
when quantifying inventory results:
•Weighting factors for delayed emissions
•Offsets
•Avoided emissions
In a life cycle, particularly for products that have long
use and end-of-life time periods, emissions may occur
at different points in time and have different impacts
on the atmosphere. Some methodologies try to capture
this in the life cycle results by applying a weighting
factor to account for emissions delayed over time (also
