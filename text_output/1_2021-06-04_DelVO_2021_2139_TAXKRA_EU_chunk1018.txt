(b) for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state-of-the-art
climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios (  612  ) consistent with the expected lifetime 
of the activity, including, at least, 10 to 30 year climate projections scenarios for major investments.
3. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and
take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line
with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports (  613  ), scientific peer-reviewed 
publications and open source (  614  ) or paying models. 
4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people,
of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  615  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  616  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)

facture of fossil fuels.
For buildings built before 31 December 2020, the building has at least an
Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) class C. As an alternative, the
building is within the top 30 % of the national or regional building
stock expressed as operational Primary Energy Demand (PED) and demon ­
strated by adequate evidence, which at least compares the performance of
the relevant asset to the performance of the national or regional stock
