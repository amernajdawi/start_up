econom y in several ways. It can, for example, increase the durability , reparability , upgradability and reusability of

disassembly and deconstr uction in the buildings and constr uction sector , in particular to reduce the use of building
mater ials and promote the reuse of building mat erials. It can also contr ibute substantially to the environmental
