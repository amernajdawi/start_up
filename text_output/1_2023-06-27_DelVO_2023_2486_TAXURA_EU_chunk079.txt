Substantial contribution to the transition to a circular economy
1.All generated construction and demolition waste is treated in accordance with Union waste legislation and the full
checklist of the EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol, in particular by setting sorting systems and
pre-demolition audits (98). The preparing for re-use (99)or recycling (100)of the non-hazardous construction and demolition
waste generated on the construction site is at least 70 % (by mass in kilogrammes), excluding backfilling (101). This excludes
naturally occurring material referred to in category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by Decision 2000/532/EC. The operator of the activity demonstrates compliance with the 70 % threshold by reporting on the Level(s)
indicator 2.2 (
102)using the Level 2 reporting format for different waste streams.
2.The life cycle Global Warming Potential (GWP) (103)of the building’s renovation works has been calculated for each stage
in the life cycle, from the point of renovation, and is disclosed to investors and clients on demand.
3.Construction designs and techniques support circularity via the incorporation of concepts for design for adaptability
and deconstruction as outlined in Level(s) indicators 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. The operator of the activity demonstrates
compliance with this requirement by reporting on the Level(s) indicators 2.3 (104)and 2.4 (105)at Level 2.
(98)EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol, Annex F (version of 27.6.2023: https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/
documents/20509/).
(99)‘Preparing for re-use’ means checking, cleaning or repairing recovery operations, by which products or components of products that
have become waste are prepared so that they can be re-used without any other pre-processing. This includes, for instance, the
preparation for re-use of certain parts of buildings like roof elements, windows, doors, bricks, stones or concrete elements. A pre- requisite for the preparation for re-use of building elements is usually the selective deconstruction of buildings or other structures.
(100)‘Recycling’ means any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances whether
for the original or other purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material but does not include energy recovery and the
reprocessing into materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations.
(101)‘Backfilling’ means any recovery operation where suitable non-hazardous waste is used for purposes of reclamation in excavated areas
or for engineering purposes in landscaping. Waste used for backfilling must substitute non-waste materials, be suitable for the
aforementioned purposes, and be limited to the amount strictly necessary to achieve those purposes.
(102)See Level(s) indicator 2.2: Construction and demolition waste and materials, user manual: introductory briefing, instructions and
guidance (Publication version 1.1), https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau//sites/default/files/2021-01/
UM3_Indicator_2.2_v1.1_40pp.pdf. For reporting, the Excel spreadsheet available on the Commission website is to be used:

and types of CDW and their final destinations (version 1.1), https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/product-groups/412/

(103)The GWP is communicated as a numeric indicator for each life cycle stage expressed as kgCO 2e/m2 (of useful internal floor area)
