[122]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard
Box [B.2]  Estimating land-use change impacts without specific data 
Source: FAO, FAOSTAT. Available from http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567#ancor , 2011. Table [B.1]  Area harvested for crops grown in Malaysia in 2008 that contribute more than 1 percent 
individually to total harvested hectares (ha). In this example, the following steps were taken to
determine whether land-use change impacts are
attributable to palm oil and rice, and, if so, to produce
the land-use impact estimate.  The Food and Agriculture 
Organization’s (FAO) statistical database is used to make
the estimations, and both products are assumed to come
from Malaysia.  (See FAO website for more information: 
http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/default.aspx#ancor .)
1.    Determine the most-planted crops  
in the assumed location
The first step is to determine the country profile for
the most-planted crops.   Because many agricultural 
products are harvested in Malaysia, only crops that on
their own contribute more than 1 percent of the countries’
harvested area are considered. If the studied crop is not
within the top 1 percent of area harvested in the location,
this is an indication that the assumed location is not
appropriate. Companies should assume a location where
a large amount, if not the largest amount, of the studied
product is harvested from each year.  Table B.1 shows these statistics, where the crops not shown (because they 
are less than 1 percent individually) contribute 4 percent
to the total acreage.
2.    Collect historical land-use data  
for the studied product.
The second step is to collect historical land-use data for
the studied products to determine whether their land
use has increased or decreased over the assessment
period (20 years in this example). Because statistical
land-use data are often published a few years behind
schedule (e.g., 2008 data published in 2010), companies
can use the data as long as the unknown period does not
exceed three years. If the unknown period does exceed
three years, companies should either supplement the
data with more recent statistics or consider another
method to estimate land-use change impacts.  
In figure B.3, the total change in the area harvested
for rice paddy over the 20-year period remains fairly
steady (e.g., does not exceed a 1-percent increase). It
