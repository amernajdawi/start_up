(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  At least 70 % (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and 
demolition waste (excluding naturally occurring material defined in
category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by
Decision 2000/532/EC) generated on the construction site is prepared
for reuse, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling oper Â­
ations using waste to substitute other materials, in accordance with the
waste hierarchy and the EU Construction and Demolition Waste
Management Protocol (  276  ). Operators limit waste generation in processes 
related construction and demolition, in accordance with the EU
Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol and taking
into account best available techniques and using selective demolition to
enable removal and safe handling of hazardous substances and facilitate
reuse and high-quality recycling by selective removal of materials, using
available sorting systems for construction and demolition waste.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Where appropriate, given the sensitivity of the area affected, in particular 
in terms of the size of population affected, noise and vibrations from use
of infrastructure are mitigated by introducing open trenches, wall barriers,
or other measures and comply with Directive 2002/49/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council (  277  ). 
Measures are taken to reduce noise, dust and pollutant emissions during
construction or maintenance works.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
6.15.  Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport  
Description of the activity  
Construction, modernisation, maintenance and operation of infrastructure that is required for zero tailpipe CO  2 
operation of zero-emissions road transport, as well as infrastructure dedicated to transshipment, and infrastructure
required for operating urban transport.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular F42.11,
F42.13, F71.1 and F71.20 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by
Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 10(1), point (i), of Regulation
(EU) 2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. The activity complies with one or more of the following criteria:
(a) the infrastructure is dedicated to the operation of vehicles with zero tailpipe CO  2 emissions: electric charging 
points, electricity grid connection upgrades, hydrogen fuelling stations or electric road systems (ERS);
