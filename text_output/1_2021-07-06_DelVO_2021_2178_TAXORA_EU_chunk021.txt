The KPI shall be calculated as the numerator divided by the denominator as specified in points 1.1 and 1.2 of this Annex.
1.1. Numerator
The numerator shall consist of a weighted average of the value of investments in Taxonomy-aligned economic activities of
investee companies. The weighted average of the value of investments shall be based on the proportion of taxonomy-
aligned economic activities of investee companies measured by the following:
(a) for investees that are non-financial undertakings, turnover and CapEx KPIs as resulting from the calculation of the KPIs
of the investee in accordance with Annexes I and II;
(b) for investees that are asset managers, turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs, as resulting from the calculation of the
KPIs of the investee in accordance with Annexes III and IV;
(c) for investees that are credit institutions, the turnover-based and CapEx based green asset ratio as resulting from the
calculation of the green asset ratio of the investee in accordance with Annexes V and VI;
(d) for investees that are investments firms, investments and revenues, as resulting from the calculation of the turnover- based and CapEx based KPIs of the investee in accordance with Annexes VII and VIII in accordance with the
proportion of services and activities of dealing on own account and not dealing on own account in the income of the
investment firm;
(e) for investees that are insurance or reinsurance undertakings, investments, gross premiums written or, as applicable,
total insurance revenue, as resulting from the calculation either of the turnover-based and CapEx based investment
KPI, combined, where applicable with the underwriting KPI of the non-life investee insurance and reinsurance
undertakings in accordance with this Annexes IX and X.
The calculation shall allow netting for the purposes of reporting the proportion of investments in taxonomy-aligned
economic activities by applying the methodology used to calculate net short positions laid down in Article 3, paragraphs 4
and 5 of Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (
1).
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this point 1.1, debt securities with the purpose of financing specific
identified activities or projects or environmentally sustainable bonds issued by an investee undertaking shall be included in
the numerator up to the value of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities that the proceeds of those bonds and debt
securities finance, on the basis of information provided by the investee undertaking.
1.2. Denominator
The denominator shall consist of the value of all Asset under Management (AuM) without exposures referred to in
Article 7(1) of this Regulation resulting from both collective and individual portfolio management activities of asset
managers.
Asset managers shall disclose a KPI based on turnover KPIs of the investee companies and a KPI based on the CapEx KPI of
investee companies.
2. Methodology for preparing and reporting the KPI to be disclosed by asset managers
For the purposes of disclosures under Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, asset managers shall:
