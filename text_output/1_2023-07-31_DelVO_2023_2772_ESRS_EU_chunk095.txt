ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 97/284Connectivity of energy intensity based on net revenue with financial reporting information
AR 38. The reconciliation of net revenue from activities in high climate impact sectors to the relevant financial statements
line item or disclosure (as required by paragraph 43) may be presented either:
(a) by a cross-reference to the related line item or disclosure in the financial statements; or
(b) If the net revenue cannot be directly cross-referenced to a line item or disclosure in the financial statements, by
a quantitative reconciliation using the below tabular format.
Net revenue from activities in high climate impact sectors
used to calculate energy intensity
Net revenue (other)
Total net revenue (Financial statements)
Disclosure Requirements E1-6 â€“ Gross Scopes 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions
Calculation guidance
AR 39. When preparing the information for reporting GHG emissions as required by paragraph 44, the undertaking shall:
(a) consider the principles, requirements and guidance provided by the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard
(version 2004). The undertaking may consider Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279 (51)or the
requirements stipulated by EN ISO 14064-1:2018. If the undertaking already applies the GHG accounting
methodology of ISO 14064- 1: 2018, it shall nevertheless comply with the requirements of this standard
(e.g., regarding reporting boundaries and the disclosure of market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions);
(b) disclose the methodologies, significant assumptions and emissions factors used to calculate or measure GHG
emissions accompanied by the reasons why they were chosen, and provide a reference or link to any
calculation tools used;
(c) include emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, and NF3. Additional GHG may be considered when
significant; and
(d) use the most recent Global Warming Potential (GWP) values published by the IPCC based on a 100-year time
horizon to calculate CO2eq emissions of non-CO2 gases.
AR 40. When preparing the information for reporting GHG emissions from its associates, joint ventures, unconsolidated
subsidiaries (investment entities) and contractual arrangements as required by paragraph 50, the undertaking shall
consolidate 100% of the GHG emissions of the entities it operationally controls. In practice, this happens when the
undertakings holds the license - or permit - to operate the assets from these associates, joint ventures,
unconsolidated subsidiaries (investment entities) and contractual arrangements. When the undertaking has a
contractually defined part-time operational control, it shall consolidate 100% the GHG emitted during the time of
its operational control.
