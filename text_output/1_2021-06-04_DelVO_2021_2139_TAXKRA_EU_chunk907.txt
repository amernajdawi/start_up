4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people,
of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  622  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  623  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  The activity has demonstrated best efforts to implement the relevant 
practices listed as ‘expected practices’ in the most recent version of the
European Code of Conduct on Data Centre Energy Efficiency (  624  ), or in 
CEN-CENELEC document CLC TR50600-99-1 ‘Data centre facilities and
infrastructures - Part 99-1: Recommended practices for energy manage ­
ment’ (  625  ) and has implemented all expected practices that have been 
assigned the maximum value of 5 according to the most recent version
of the European Code of Conduct on Data Centre Energy Efficiency.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  The equipment used meets the requirements laid down in Directive 
2009/125/EC for servers and data storage products.
The equipment used does not contain the restricted substances listed in
Annex II to Directive 2011/65/EU, except where the concentration values
by weight in homogeneous materials do not exceed the maximum values
listed in that Annex.
A waste management plan is in place and ensures maximal recycling at
end of life of electrical and electronic equipment, including through
contractual agreements with recycling partners, reflection in financial
projections or official project documentation.
At its end of life, the equipment undergoes preparation for re-use, recovery
or recycling operations, or proper treatment, including the removal of all
fluids and a selective treatment in accordance with Annex VII to Directive
2012/19/EU.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  N/A  
(6) Protection and restoration of
