Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  A monitoring plan is in place for methane leakage at the facility.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  N/A  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The permanent closure and remediation as well as the after-care of old 
landfills, where the landfill gas capture system is installed, are carried out
in accordance with the following rules:
(a) general requirements set out in Annex I to Directive 1999/31/EC;
(b) control and monitoring procedures set out in Annex III to that Direc ­
tive.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
5.11.  Transport of CO  2 
Description of the activity  
Transport of captured CO  2 via all modes, construction and operation of CO  2 pipelines and retrofit of gas networks 
where the main purpose is the integration of captured CO  2 and where:  
(a) the CO  2 transported from the installation where it is captured to the injection point does not lead to CO  2 
leakages above 0.5 % of the mass of CO  2 transported;  
(b) the CO  2 is delivered to a permanent CO  2 storage site that meets the criteria for underground geological storage 
of CO  2 set out in section 5.12 of this Annex; or to other transport modalities, which lead to permanent CO  2 
storage site that meet those criteria;  
(c) appropriate leak detection systems are applied and a monitoring plan is in place, with the report verified by an
independent third party;  
(d) the activity may include the installation of assets that increase the flexibility and improve the management of
an existing network.  
The activity could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular F42.21 and H49.50 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
