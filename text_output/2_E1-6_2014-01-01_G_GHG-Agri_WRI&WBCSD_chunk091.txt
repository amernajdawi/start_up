: averaging prices over three to five years can help avoid this problem ) .  Prices are not well - correlate d with underlying physical pr operties and GHG fluxes .  Companies pay different prices for the same pr oduct ( due to different negotiated prices ) .

Economic allocation is preferred when:
 A physical relationship amongst th e products cannot be establis hed or does not adequately
reflect their GHG impacts.  
 The co-products were a waste output that acquire s value in the market place as a replacement
for another material input (e.g., manur e as a replacement for fertilizer).

Appendix II: Amortizing CO 2 Fluxes to / from Carbon Stocks

Introduction
Shifts in the management of farmland or the conversion of one land-us e category into another
can change C stocks over long time periods. Chapter 8 describes methodologies for accounting
for the associated CO 2 fluxes. Depending on how these fluxes have been calculated, they may
have to be amortized over a defined time period,  with an equal amount of  flux allocated to each 
year over that period. Consistent with Inte rgovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
methodologies, the length of this period can be assumed to be 20 years, unless more specific
information is available (see Chapter 8.3).   The amortization approach is illustrated here us ing a common land use pattern in central Brazil - 
the conversion of native vegetati on (cerrado) into pasture and s ubsequently into an annual crop
rotation (soybean-corn). Two cases are presented:
 Case A: All soil stock changes are amortized  before any further changes occur in the 
ownership or management of stocks  
 Case B:
 Case C: Purchase of land undergoing changes in C stocks
While these cases are hypothetical, they use repres entative data on soil C st ocks that are derived
from published studies. To facilit ate ease of understanding, only soil C stocks are considered,
while all fluxes are amortized before any furt her shifts occur in ma nagement practices. The
management practices and land-use types consid ered, along with the corresponding C stocks, are
shown in Table II-1.  Table II-1.  Soil C stocks of different manage ment practices and land use types.
