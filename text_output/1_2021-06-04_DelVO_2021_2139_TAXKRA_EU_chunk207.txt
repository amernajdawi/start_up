1.2. Preferably through the afforestation plan, or if information is
missing, through any other document, detailed information is provided
on the following points:
(a) description of the area according to its gazetting in the land registry;
(b) site preparation and its impacts on pre-existing carbon stocks,
including soils and above-ground biomass, in order to protect land
with high carbon stock (  8 ); 
(c) management goals, including major constraints;
(d) general strategies and activities planned to reach the management
goals, including expected operations over the whole forest cycle;
(e) definition of the forest habitat context, including main existing and
intended forest tree species, and their extent and distribution;
(f) compartments, roads, rights of way and other public access, physical
features including waterways, areas under legal and other restrictions;
(g) measures deployed to establish and maintain the good condition of
forest ecosystems;
(h) consideration of societal issues (including preservation of landscape,
consultation of stakeholders in accordance with the terms and
conditions laid down in national law);
(i) assessment of forest related risks, including forest fires, and pests and
diseases outbreaks, with the aim of preventing, reducing and
controlling the risks and measures deployed to ensure protection
and adaptation against residual risks;
(j) assessment of impact on food security;
(k) all DNSH criteria relevant to afforestation.
1.3. When the area becomes a forest, the afforestation plan is followed
by a subsequent forest management plan or an equivalent instrument, as
set out in national law or, where national law does not define a forest
management plan or equivalent instrument, as referred to in the FAO
definition of ‘forest area with long-term forest management plan’ (  9 ). The 
forest management plan or the equivalent instrument covers a period of
10 years or more and is continuously updated.
1.4. Information is provided on the following points that are not
already documented in the forest management plan or equivalent system:
(a) management goals, including major constraints (  10 ); 
(b) general strategies and activities planned to reach the management
goals, including expected operations over the whole forest cycle;
