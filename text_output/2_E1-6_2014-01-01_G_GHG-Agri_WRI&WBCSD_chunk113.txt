9.3 Additional information that may be reported
Besides the required and best practice reporting elements, companies may wish to report
other information to enhance the transparency  and relevance of thei r inventories. This 
information includes:
 Data on the size of C stocks (in metric tonnes C per unit land area)
 Biogenic CO
2 flux data further subdivided by th e type of C stock (e.g., DOM versus
biomass stocks)
 Other GHG flux data further subdivided by the type of non-mechanical source (e.g.,
enteric fermentation versus manure management)

13 This Guidance follows the ‘land-based’ approach for recognizing LUC, as opposed to an ‘activities-
based’ approach. Land-based approaches assess the net emissions of select land-use categories while
activity-based approaches as sess the net emissions of select land-use activities. Both approaches can be
used for developing national GHG inventories for the UNFCCC.
