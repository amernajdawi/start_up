election and recalculation of a base year should
relate to the business goals and the particularcontext of the company:
For the purpose of reporting progress towards volun-
tary public GHG targets, companies may follow thestandards and guidance in this chapter
A company subject to an external GHG program may
face external rules governing the choice and recalcu-lation of base year emissions
For internal management goals, the company may
follow the rules and guidelines recommended in thisdocument, or it may develop its own approach, whichshould be followed consistently.Choosing a base year
Companies should choose as a base year the earliest rele-vant point in time for which they have reliable data.Some organizations have adopted 1990 as a base year inorder to be consistent with the Kyoto Protocol. However,obtaining reliable and verifiable data for historical baseyears such as 1990 can be very challenging.
If a company continues to grow through acquisitions, it
may adopt a policy that shifts or “rolls” the base yearforward by a number of years at regular intervals.Chapter 11 contains a description of such a “rollingbase year,” including a comparison with the fixed baseyear approach described in this chapter. A fixed baseyear has the advantage of allowing emissions data to becompared on a like-with-like basis over a longer timeperiod than a rolling base year approach. Most emis-sions trading and registry programs require a fixed baseyear policy to be implemented.GUIDANCETracking Emissions Over Time

Company Gamma consists of two business units (A and B). In its base year (year one), each business unit emits 25 tonnes CO2. In year two,
the company undergoes “organic growth,” leading to an increase in emissions to 30 tonnes CO2per business unit, i.e., 60 tonnes CO2in
total. The base year emissions are not recalculated in this case. At the beginning of year three, the company acquires producti on facility C
from another company. The annual emissions of facility C in year one were 15 tonnes CO2, and 20 tonnes CO2in years two and three. The
total emission of company Gamma in year three, including facility C, are therefore 80 tonnes CO2. To maintain consistency over time, the
company recalculates its base year emissions to take into account the acquisition of facility C. The base year emissions increa se by
15 tonnes CO2—the quantity of emissions produced by facility C in Gamma’s base year. The recalculated base year emissions are
65 tonnes CO2. Gamma also (optionally) reports 80 tonnes CO2as the recalculated emissions for year two.
