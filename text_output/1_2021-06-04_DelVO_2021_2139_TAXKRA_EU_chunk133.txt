Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The activity produces heat/cool from waste heat.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  N/A  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  The activity assesses availability of and, where feasible, uses equipment and 
components of high durability and recyclability and that are easy to
dismantle and refurbish.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Pumps and the kind of equipment used, which is covered by Ecodesign 
and Energy labelling comply, where relevant, with the top class
requirements of the energy label laid down in Regulation (EU) 2017/1369,
and with implementing regulations under Directive 2009/125/EC and
represent the best available technology.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
5.  WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE, WASTE MANAGEMENT AND REMEDIATION  
5.1.  Construction, extension and operation of water collection, treatment and supply systems  
Description of the activity  
Construction, extension and operation of water collection, treatment and supply systems.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E36.00 and
F42.99 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The water supply system complies with one of the following criteria:
(a) the net average energy consumption for abstraction and treatment equals to or is lower than 0,5 kWh per
cubic meter produced water supply. Net energy consumption may take into account measures decreasing
energy consumption, such as source control (pollutant load inputs), and, as appropriate, energy generation
(such as hydraulic, solar and wind energy);EN  L 442/90 Official Journal of the European Union 9.12.2021
