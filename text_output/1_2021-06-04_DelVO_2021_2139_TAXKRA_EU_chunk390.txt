(4) Transition to a circular economy  At least 70 % (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and demo ­
lition waste (excluding naturally occurring material referred to in in
category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by
Decision 2000/532/EC) generated on the construction site is prepared
for reuse, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling oper ­
ations using waste to substitute other materials, in accordance with the
waste hierarchy and the EU Construction and Demolition Waste
Management Protocol (  547  ). Operators limit waste generation in processes 
related construction and demolition, in accordance with the EU
Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol and taking
into account best available techniques and using selective demolition to
enable removal and safe handling of hazardous substances and facilitate
reuse and high-quality recycling by selective removal of materials, using
available sorting systems for construction and demolition waste.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Where appropriate, given the sensitivity of the area affected, in particular 
in terms of the size of population affected, noise and vibrations from use
of infrastructure are mitigated by introducing open trenches, wall barriers
or other measures and comply with Directive 2002/49/EC.
Measures are taken to reduce noise, dust and pollutant emissions during
construction or maintenance works.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
6.15.  Infrastructure enabling road transport and public transport  
Description of the activity  
Construction, modernisation, maintenance and operation of motorways, streets, roads, other vehicular and
pedestrian ways, surface work on streets, roads, highways, bridges or tunnels and construction of airfield
runways, including the provision of architectural services, engineering services, drafting services, building inspection
services and surveying and mapping services and the like as well as the performance of physical, chemical and
other analytical testing of all types of materials and products, and excludes the installation of street lighting and
electrical signals.  
The economic activities in this category could be classified under several NACE codes, in particular F42.11, F42.13,
F71.1 and F71.20 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation
(EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.
