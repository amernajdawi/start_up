[115]The quantification of GHG emissions and removals across a product’s life cycle is complex
and the results are highly dependent on methodological choices and assumptions. Valid
product comparison requires the use of equivalent methodologies that minimize the
methodological variability. In order to compare products on a fair and valid basis, companies
need to supplement use of the Product Standard .
As stated in chapter 1, this standard is intended to support
performance tracking of one product over time.  For 
other types of product comparison – including consumer
and business purchasing decisions, product labels, and
performance claims – additional specifications are needed.  
Claims regarding the overall environmental superiority or
equivalence of one product versus a competing product,
referred to in ISO 14044 as comparative assertions, are
not supported by the  Product Standard . Table A.1 provides 
descriptions and examples of types of product comparison, and table A.2 illustrates the applicability of
this standard for each comparison type.
For companies and stakeholders that choose to
perform product comparison, the following additional
specifications are recommended.
Performance tracking:  
•The unit of analysis should be identical
•If the parameters and methodologies change, the
previous inventory shall be adjusted to permit
comparison on the same basisAppendix A.  Guidance on Product Comparison 
Comparison type Description Example
Performance tracking Comparing the performance of the same
product over time.Product X emits 8 lbs. of CO2e per unit
of analysis in 2010 compared with a
2005 base inventory of 10 lbs. CO2e
per unit of analysis, demonstrating a
20-percent improvement.
Consumer and business
purchasing decisionsA consumer or business changes  
purchasing habits based on the GHG
performance of one product compared
with a competing product. A retailer increases milk purchases from
the milk producer with the lowest GHG
product inventory.
Product labels A label printed on a product making a  
claim (either quantitative or qualitative)
about the life cycle performance of  
the product.  A label on a bag of popcorn states the 
product GHG emissions are 7 grams.
Performance claims Advertising the GHG benefits of a  
product by the company performing  
the inventory or a third party.A consumer group advertises on  
their website a list of products they
claim emit less GHG emissions than
competing products.  Table [A.1] Types of comparisons that can be made using a product GHG inventory
