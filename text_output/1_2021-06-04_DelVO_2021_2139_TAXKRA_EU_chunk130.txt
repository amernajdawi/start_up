(5) Pollution prevention and control  For the operation of high-enthalpy geothermal energy systems, adequate 
abatement systems are in place to reduce emission levels in order not to
hamper the achievement of air quality limit values set out in Directives
2004/107/EC and 2008/50/EC.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
4.23.  Production of heat/cool from renewable non-fossil gaseous and liquid fuels  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of heat generation facilities that produce heat/cool using gaseous and liquid fuels of
renewable origin. This activity does not include production of heat/cool from the exclusive use of biogas and bio-
liquid fuels (see Section 4.24 of this Annex).  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code D35.30 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. The life-cycle GHG emissions from the generation of heat/cool using renewable gaseous and liquid fuels are
lower than 100 g CO  2 e/kWh. 
Life-cycle GHG emissions are calculated based on project-specific data, where available, using Recommendation
2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using ISO 14067:2018 (  199  ) or ISO 14064-1:2018 (  200  ). 
Quantified life-cycle GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party.
2. Where facilities incorporate any form of abatement (including carbon capture or use of decarbonised fuels),
that abatement activity complies with the relevant Sections of this Annex, where applicable.
Where the CO  2 that would otherwise be emitted from the electricity generation process is captured for the 
purpose of underground storage, the CO  2 is transported and stored underground, in accordance with the 
technical screening criteria set out in Sections 5.11 and 5.12 of this Annex.
3. The activity meets either of the following criteria:
(a) at construction, measurement equipment for monitoring physical emissions, such as methane leakage is
installed or a leak detection and repair program is introduced;
(b) at operation, physical measurement of methane emissions are reported and leak is eliminated.
4. Where the activity blends renewable gaseous or liquid fuels with biogas or bioliquids, the agricultural
biomass used for the production of the biogas or bioliquids complies with the criteria laid down in Article 29,
paragraphs 2 to 5, of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 while forest biomass complies with the criteria laid down in
Article 29, paragraphs 6 and 7, of that Directive.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.
