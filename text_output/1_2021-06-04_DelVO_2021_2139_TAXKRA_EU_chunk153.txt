245 ) The Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator is defined as the ratio of mass of CO 2 emitted per unit of transport work . It is a representative value of the energy efficiency of the ship operation over a consistent period which represents the overall tradi ng pattern of the vessel .

(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Measures are in place to manage waste, both in the use phase and in the 
end-of-life of the vessel, in accordance with the waste hierarchy, including
the control and management of hazardous materials on board of ships and
ensuring their safe recycling.
For battery-operated vessels, those measures include reuse and recycling of
batteries and electronics, including critical raw materials therein.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Vessels comply with the emission limits set out in Annex II to Regulation 
(EU) 2016/1628 (including vessels meeting those limits without type-
approved solutions such as through after-treatment).  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  N/A  
6.9.  Retrofitting of inland water passenger and freight transport  
Description of the activity  
Retrofit and upgrade of vessels for transport of freight or passengers on inland waters, involving vessels that are
not suitable for sea transport.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated several NACE codes, in particular H50.4, H50.30 and
C33.15 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is a transitional activity as referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU)
2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. Until 31 December 2025, the retrofitting activity reduces fuel consumption of the vessel by at least 10 %
expressed in litre of fuel per tonne kilometre, as demonstrated by a comparative calculation for the representative
navigation areas (including representative load profiles) in which the vessel is to operate or by means of the
results of model tests or simulations.
2. Vessels retrofitted or upgraded are not dedicated to transport of fossil fuels.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.
