AR 10. If the policies are limited to the undertaking’s own workforce and do not cover workers in upstream and
downstream entities and relationships, they shall be disclosed under ESRS S1 and not in relation to this
requirement.
AR 11. If the disclosures under ESRS S1 include information relevant for workers in the value chain, a reference to this can be made here; disclosures on the remaining elements shall then be fulfilled under this Disclosure Requirement.
AR 12. The undertaking may disclose explanations of significant changes to the policies adopted during the reporting year
(e.g., new expectations for suppliers, new or additional approaches to due diligence and remedy).
AR 13. The policy may take the form of a stand-alone policy regarding value chain workers or be included in a broader
document such as a code of ethics or a general sustainability policy that has already been disclosed by the
undertaking as part of another ESRS. In those cases, the undertaking shall provide an accurate cross-reference to
identify the aspects of the policy that satisfy the requirements of this Disclosure Requirement.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
