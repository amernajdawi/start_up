(b) measures to protect or enhance morphological conditions and habitats
for aquatic species;
(c) measures to reduce adverse impacts of eutrophication.
The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the
authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good
status or potential of the affected water body.
The project does not permanently compromise the achievement of good
status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district.
In addition to the mitigation measures referred to above, and where
relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the
project does not result in overall deterioration of status of water bodies
in the same river basin district. This is achieved by restoring (longitudinal
or lateral) continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that
compensates the disruption of continuity, which the planned navigation
infrastructure project may cause. Compensation starts prior to the
execution of the project.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  At least 70 % (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and demo Â­
lition waste (excluding naturally occurring material defined in category
17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by Decision
2000/532/EC) generated on the construction site is prepared for reuse,
recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling operations
using waste to substitute other materials, in accordance with the waste
hierarchy and the EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management
Protocol (  559  ). Operators limit waste generation in processes related 
construction and demolition, in accordance with the EU Construction
and Demolition Waste Management Protocol and taking into account
best available techniques and using selective demolition to enable
removal and safe handling of hazardous substances and facilitate reuse
and high-quality recycling by selective removal of materials, using
available sorting systems for construction and demolition waste.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Measures are taken to reduce noise, vibration, dust and pollutant emissions 
during construction maintenance works.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.
