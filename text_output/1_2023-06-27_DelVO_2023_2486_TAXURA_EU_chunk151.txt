(1) Climate change mitigation The activity does not involve the degradation of land with high carbon stock (72).
Measures to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions (73)of the full removal or
treatment process are included in the remediation plan.
(2) Climate change adaptation The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.
(3) Sustainable use and protec ­
tion of water and marine
resourcesThe activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.
(4) Transition to a circular
economyAt least 70 % (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction, demolition or other waste materials (excluding naturally occurring material defined in category 17 05 04 in the
European List of Waste established by Decision 2000/532/EC) generated on the site
under remediation is prepared for reuse, recycling and other material recovery,
including backfilling operations using waste to substitute other materials, in
accordance with the waste hierarchy and the EU Construction and Demolition Waste
Management Protocol (
74), unless a clear justification is given in the approved
Remediation Plan based on technical or environmental reasons, other than cost
considerations.
(6) Protection and restoration
of biodiversity and ecosys ­
temsThe activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this Annex.
The following is to be ensured:
(a) in the Union, in relation with Natura 2000 sites: the activity does not have
significant effects on Natura 2000 sites in view of their conservation objectives on
the basis of an appropriate assessment carried out in accordance with Article 6(3) of
Directive 92/43/EEC;
(b) in the Union, in any area: the activity is not detrimental to the recovery or
maintenance of the populations of species protected under Directives 92/43/EEC
and 2009/147/EC at a favourable conservation status. The activity is also not
detrimental to the recovery or maintenance of the habitat types concerned and
protected under Directive 92/43/EEC at a favourable conservation status;
(c) the introduction of invasive alien species is prevented, or their spread is managed in
accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014.
(72)Land with high-carbon stock means wetlands, including peatland, and continuously forested areas grasslands, mangroves and seagrass
meadows within the meaning of Article 29(4)(a), (b) and (c) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.
(73)‘Scope 1 GHG emissions’ means the direct greenhouse gas emissions occurring from sources that are owned or controlled by the
operator. ‘Scope 2 GHG emissions’ means the indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the generation of the electricity consumed by
the operator.
