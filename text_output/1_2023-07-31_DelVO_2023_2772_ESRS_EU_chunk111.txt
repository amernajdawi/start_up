ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 112/284(e) the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and
opportunities arising from the undertaking’s pollution-related impacts and dependencies.
2. This Standard sets out Disclosure Requirements related to the following sustainability matters: pollution of air,
water, soil, substances of concern, including substances of very high concern.
3. “Pollution of air” refers to the undertaking’s emissions into air (both indoor and outdoor), and prevention, control
and reduction of such emissions.
4. “Pollution of water” refers to the undertaking’s emissions to water, and prevention, control and reduction of such
emissions.
5. “Pollution of soil” refers to the undertaking’s emissions into soil and the prevention, control and reduction of such
emissions.
6. With regard to “substances of concern”, this standard covers the undertaking’s production, use and/or distribution
and commercialisation of substances of concern, including substances of very high concern. Disclosure
Requirements on substances of concern aim at providing users with an understanding of actual or potential impacts
related to such substances, also taking account of possible restrictions on their use and/or distribution and
commercialisation.
Interaction with other ESRS
7. The topic of pollution is closely connected to other environmental sub-topics such as climate change, water and
marine resources, biodiversity and circular economy . Thus, to provide a comprehensive overview of what could be
material to pollution, relevant Disclosure Requirements are covered in other environmental Standards as follows:
(a) ESRS E1 Climate change which addresses the following seven greenhouse gases connected to air pollution: carbon
dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs),
sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).
(b) ESRS E3 Water and marine resources which addresses water consumption, in particular in areas at water risk,
water recycling and storage. This also includes the responsible management of marine resources, including the
nature and quantity of marine resources-related commodities (such as gravels, deep-sea minerals, seafood) used by the undertaking. This Standard covers the negative impacts, in terms of pollution of water and marine
resources, including microplastics, generated by such activities.
(c) ESRS E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems which addresses ecosystems and species. Pollution as a direct impact driver of
biodiversity loss is addressed by this Standard.
(d) ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy which addresses, in particular, the transition away from extraction of
non-renewable resources and the implementation of practices that prevent waste generation, including
pollution generated by waste.
8. The undertaking’s pollution-related impacts may affect people and communities. Material negative impacts on
affected communities from pollution-related impacts attributable to the undertaking are covered in ESRS S3 Affected
communities.
9. This Standard should be read in conjunction with ESRS 1 General requirements and ESRS 2 General disclosures .
