SCOPE 1 EMISSION SOURCES
•Process emissions (calcination of limestone)
•Stationary combustion (clinker kiln, drying of
raw materials, production of electricity)
•Mobile combustion (quarry operations,
on-site transportation)
•Stationary combustion (incinerators, boilers, flaring)
•Process emissions (sewage treatment, nitrogen loading)
•Fugitive emissions (CH4and CO2emissions from
waste and animal product decomposition)
•Mobile combustion (transportation of waste/products)
•Stationary combustion (production of steam and elec-
tricity, fossil fuel-derived emissions from calcination of calcium carbonate in lime kilns, drying products withinfrared driers fired with fossil fuels)
•Mobile combustion (transportation of raw materials, prod-
ucts, and wastes, operation of harvesting equipment)
•Fugitive emissions (CH
4and CO2from waste)
•Stationary combustion(production of electricity,
heat or steam)
•Process emissions (HFC venting)
•Mobile combustion (transportation of raw
materials/products/waste)
•Fugitive emissions (HFC use)
•Process emissions (C2F6, CH4, CHF3, SF6, NF3, C3F8,
C4F8, N2O used in wafer fabrication, CF4created from
C2F6and C3F8processing)
•Stationary combustion (oxidation of volatile organic
waste, production of electricity, heat or steam)
•Fugitive emissions (process gas storage leaks,
container remainders/heel leakage)
•Mobile combustion (transportation of raw
materials/products/waste)
•Stationary combustion (production of electricity, heat or steam)
•Mobile combustion (transportation of raw
materials/waste)
•Fugitive emissions (mainly HFC emissions during use
of refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment)SCOPE 2
