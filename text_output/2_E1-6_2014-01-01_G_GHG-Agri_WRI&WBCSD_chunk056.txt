x Total flux The market value of co - product ( s ) should be th e value of the co - products as they leave the common process ( i . e . prior to any further proces sing ) . Also , if prices for the outputs vary over the reporting period , it may be necessary to develop averages for the market values of the outputs over this period . Under either physical or economic allocati on , co - products without economic value are considered wastes and should have no GHG fluxes allocated to them .

Selecting an allocation approach   
A single approach should be used to consistently allocate the GHG data for all of the products of
a farm. Otherwise, the use of multiple alloca tion methods might result in the over- or under-
counting of total farm-wide fluxes.   Different allocation methods can yield significantly different resu lts. For example, in cheese 
manufacturing, cheese is consid ered the main product, while whey powder, whey butter and
grated cheese are considered co-products. U nder an economic allocation approach, the higher
value of cheese compared with the co-produc ts results in most of the GHG fluxes being
attributed to the cheese. In contrast, under a phys ical allocation approach, the greater mass of the
co-products would result in most of the GHG fl uxes being attributed to the co-products.  
Companies should select the allocation approach that:
 Best reflects the causal relationship between  the production of the outputs and the resulting 
GHG fluxes;
 Results in the most accurate and credible flux estimates;

 Best supports effective decision-ma king and GHG reduction activities; and
 Otherwise adheres to the principles of rele vance, accuracy, completeness, consistency and
transparency.
Broadly, physical allocation is preferred when:
 A physical relationship amongst th e products can be established and this relationship drives
their relative GHG impacts.
 Prices change significantly or frequently ove r time. Example: fluctuation in commodity crop
prices (note: averaging prices over three to  five years can help avoid this problem).  
 Prices are not well-correlate d with underlying physical pr operties and GHG fluxes.  
 Companies pay different prices for the same pr oduct (due to different negotiated prices).  

Economic allocation is preferred when:
 A physical relationship amongst th e products cannot be establis hed or does not adequately
reflect their GHG impacts.  
 The co-products were a waste output that acquire s value in the market place as a replacement
for another material input (e.g., manur e as a replacement for fertilizer).
