necessarily considering the quality of the area being assessed, such as habitat cover. For example, forest cover is
a measure of the extent of a particular ecosystem type, without factoring in the condition of the ecosystem (e.g.,
provides the area without describing the species diversity within the forest).
(b) with regard to ecosystems condition:
i. metrics that measure the quality of ecosystems relative to a pre-determined reference state;
ii. metrics that measure multiple species within an ecosystem rather than the number of individuals within a
single species within an ecosystem (for example: scientifically established species richness and abundance indicators that measure the development of (native) species composition within an ecosystem against the
reference state at the beginning of the first reporting period as well as the targeted state outlined in the
Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, or an aggregation of speciesâ€™ conservation status if
relevant); or
iii. metrics that reflect structural components of condition such as habitat connectivity (i.e., how linked habitats
are to each other).
