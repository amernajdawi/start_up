ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 136/164 (c)Where an economic activity contributes substantially to multiple environmental objectives, non-financial undertakings shall indicate, in bold, the most relevant environmental objective for the purpose of computing the KPIs of financial undertakings while avoiding double counting. In their respective KPIs, where the use of proceeds from the financing is not known, financial undertakings shall compute the financing of economic activities contributing to multiple environmental objectives under the most relevant environmental objective that is reported in bold in this template by non-financial undertakings. An environmental objective may only be reported in bold once in one row to avoid double counting of economic activities in the KPIs of financial undertakings. This shall not apply to the computation of Taxonomy-alignment of economic activities for financial products defined in point (12) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. Non-financial undertakings shall also report the extent of eligibility and alignment per environmental objective, that includes alignment with each of environmental objectives for activities contributing substantially to several objectives, by using the template below: (d)The same activity may align with only one or more environmental objectives for which it is eligible. (e)The same activity may be eligible and not aligned with the relevant environmental objectives. (f)EL – Taxonomy-eligible activity for the relevant objective N/EL – Taxonomy-non-eligible activity for the relevant objective. (g)Activities shall be reported in Section A.2 of this template only if they are not aligning to any environmental objective for which they are eligible. Activities that align to at least one environmental objective shall be reported in Section A.1 of this template. (h)For an activity to be reported in Section A.1 all DNSH criteria and minimum safeguards shall be met. For activities listed under A2, columns (5) to (17) may be filled in on a voluntary basis by non-financial undertakings. Non-financial undertakings may indicate the substantial contribution and DNSH criteria that they meet or do not meet in Section A.2 by using: (a) for substantial contribution – Y/N and N/EL codes instead of EL and N/EL; and (b) for DNSH – Y/N codes.OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
