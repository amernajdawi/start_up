(1) Climate change mitigation  The infrastructure is not dedicated to transportation or storage of fossil 
fuels.
In case of new infrastructure or major renovation, the infrastructure has
been climate proofed in accordance with the appropriate climate proofing
practice that includes carbon footprinting and clearly defined shadow cost
of carbon. Such carbon footprinting covers scope 1-3 emissions, and
demonstrates that the infrastructure does not lead to additional relative
greenhouse gas emissions, calculated on the basis of conservative assump ­
tions, values and procedures.

( 563  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta n­
eously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more
diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-eff icient
and systemic interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of
ecosystem services (version of 4.6.2021: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/nature-
based-solutions_en/).
