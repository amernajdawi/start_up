processes;
(f) excluding the conversion of high-biodiverse ecosystems into less
biodiverse ones;

enhancing of mature stage stands and dead wood.  
2.  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND RESTORATION ACTIVITIES  
2.1.  Restoration of wetlands  
Description of the activity  
Restoration of wetlands refers to economic activities that promote a return to original conditions of wetlands and
economic activities that improve wetland functions without necessarily promoting a return to pre-disturbance
conditions, with wetlands meaning land matching the international definition of wetland (  64 ) or of peatland (  65 ) as 
set out in the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar
Convention) (  66 ). The concerned area matches the Union definition of wetlands, as provided in the Commission 
Communication on the wise use and conservation of wetlands (  67 ). 
The economic activities in this category have no dedicated NACE code as referred to in the statistical classification
of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006, but relate to class 6 of the statistical
classification of environmental protection activities (CEPA) established by Regulation (EU) No 691/2011 of the
European Parliament and of the Council (  68 ).

1. Restoration plan  
1.1. The area is covered by a restoration plan, which is consistent with the Ramsar Convention’s principles
and guidelines on wetland restoration (  69 ), until the area is classified as a wetland and is covered by a wetland 
management plan, consistent with the Ramsar Convention’s guidelines for management planning for Ramsar
sites and other wetlands (  70 ). For peatlands, the restoration plan follows the recommendations contained in 
relevant resolutions of the Ramsar Convention, including the resolution XIII/13.

( 64 ) Wetlands include a wide variety of inland habitats such as marshes, wet grasslands and peatlands, floodplains, rivers and lake s, and coastal areas
such as saltmarshes, mangroves, intertidal mudflats and seagrass beds, and coral reefs and other marine areas no deeper than si x meters at low
tide, as well as human-made wetlands such as dams, reservoirs, rice paddies and waste water treatment ponds and lagoons . An Introduction to

( 65 ) Peatlands are ecosystems with a peat soil. Peat consists of at least 30 % dead, partially decomposed plant remains that have
accumulated in situ under waterlogged and often acidic conditions. Resolution XIII.12  Guidance on identifying peatlands as Wetlands 
of International Importance (Ramsar Sites) for global climate change regulation as an additional argument to existing Ramsar cr iteria , Ramsar
