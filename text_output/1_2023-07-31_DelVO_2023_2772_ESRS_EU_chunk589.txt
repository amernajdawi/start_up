ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 245/284(c) business opportunities related to the undertaking’s impacts on consumers and/or end- users may include
market differentiation and greater customer appeal from offering safe products or privacy-respecting services;
and
(d) business opportunities related to the undertaking’s dependencies on consumers and/or end-users may include
the achievement of a loyal future consumer base by ensuring, for example, that LGBTQI people are respected and that the undertaking’s selling practices do not exclude such people from the products or services it offers.
AR 38. When disclosing whether dependencies turn into risks, the undertaking shall consider external developments.
AR 39. When disclosing policies, action and resources and targets related to the management of material risks and
opportunities, in cases where risks and opportunities arise from a material impact, the undertaking may cross- reference its disclosures on policies, action and resources and targets in relation to that impact.
AR 40. The undertaking shall consider the extent to which its processes to manage material risks related to consumers
and/or end-users are integrated into its existing risk management processes and how.
AR 41. When disclosing the resources allocated to the management of material impacts, the undertaking may disclose
which internal functions are involved in managing the impacts and what types of action they take to address
negative and advance positive impacts.
Metrics and targets
Disclosure Requirement S4-5 – Targets related to managing material negative impacts, advancing positive impacts, and
managing material risks and opportunities
AR 42. When disclosing targets in relation to consumers and/or end-users, the undertaking may disclose:
(a) the intended outcomes to be achieved in the lives of consumers and/or end-users, being as specific as possible;
(b) their stability over time in terms of definitions and methodologies to enable comparability; and/or
(c) references standards or commitments on which the targets are based are to be clearly defined in the reporting
(for instance codes of conduct, sourcing policies, global frameworks or industry codes).
AR 43. Targets related to material risks and opportunities may be the same as or distinct from targets tied to material
impacts. For example, a target to ensure equal access to finance for underserved consumers could both reduce
discrimination impacts on those consumers and enlarge the undertaking’s pool of customers.
AR 44. The undertaking may also distinguish between short, medium and long-term targets covering the same policy
