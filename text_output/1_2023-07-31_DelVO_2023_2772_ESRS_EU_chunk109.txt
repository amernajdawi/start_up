AR 77. The reconciliation of the significant amount of assets, liabilities, and net revenue (vulnerable to either material
physical risks or transition risks) to the relevant line item or disclosure (e.g., in segment reporting) in the
financial statements (as required by paragraph 68) may be presented by the undertaking as follows:
(a) as a cross-reference to the related line item or disclosure in the financial statements if these amounts are identifiable in the financial statements; or
(b) If these cannot be directly cross-referenced, as a quantitative reconciliation of each to the relevant line item or disclosure in the financial statement using the below tabular format:
Carrying amount of assets or liabilities or net revenue vulnerable to either material physical or transition risks
Adjusting itemsAssets or liabilities or net revenue in the financial statements
AR 78. The undertaking shall ensure the consistency of data and assumptions to assess and report the anticipated
financial effects from material physical risks and transition risks in the sustainability statement with the
corresponding data and assumptions used for the financial statements (e.g., carbon prices used for assessing
impairment of assets, the useful life of assets, estimates and provisions). The undertaking shall explain the reasons
for any inconsistencies (e.g., if the full financial implications of climate-related risks are still under assessment or
are not deemed material in the financial statements).
AR 79. For potential future effects on liabilities (as required by paragraph 67 (d)), if applicable, the undertaking shall cross-
reference the description of the emission trading schemes in the financial statements.
Climate-related opportunities
AR 80. When disclosing the information under paragraph 69 (a), the undertaking shall explain the nature of the cost
savings (e.g., from reduced energy consumption), the time horizons and the methodology used, including the
scope of the assessment, critical assumptions, and limitations, and whether and how scenario analysis was
applied.
AR 81. When disclosing the information required under paragraph 69 (b), the undertaking shall explain how it has assessed the market size or any expected changes to net revenue from low-carbon products and services or
adaptation solutions including the scope of the assessment, the time horizon, critical assumptions, and limitations
and to what extent this market is accessible to the undertaking. The information on the market size may be put in
perspective to the current taxonomy-aligned revenue disclosed under the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2020/852.
The entity may also explain how it will pursue its climate-related opportunities and, where possible, this should be
linked to the disclosures on policies, targets and actions under Disclosure Requirements E1-2, E1-3 and E1-4.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
