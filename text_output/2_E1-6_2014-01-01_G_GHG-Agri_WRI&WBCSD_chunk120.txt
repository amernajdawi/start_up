Contextual information should be provided
Importantly, the inherent divers ity of agricultural practices, as well as the influence of
environmental factors on GHG fluxes, will aff ect the comparability of metrics, both
within and across businesses. For example:
 Intensity ratios will often be higher for self-replacing livestock herds than non-
replacement herds. This is because self -replacing herds contain younger stock that
emit enteric CH 4 and produce N 2O from urine depositions for a longer period of time
before contributing to farm products.  
 Adverse weather conditions can lower re alized crop yields, causing inter-annual
variation in intensity ratios , independent of any changes in farming practices. (Note:
in such cases, companies may find it usef ul to normalize and report emissions by
expected yield, in addition to actual yield).  
Without adequate context on the farming system, environmental effects, and the
emissions sources that have been studie d, performance metrics are not useful for
assessing performance. Such context should be provided in reports to aid the reliable
interpretation of performance metrics.
