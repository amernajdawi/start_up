ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 7/284(b) The term “risks and opportunities” refers to the undertaking’s sustainability-related financial risks and
opportunities, including those deriving from dependencies on natural, human and social resources, as identified
through a financial materiality assessment (see section 3.5).
Collectively, these are referred to as “impacts, risks and opportunities” (IROs). They reflect the double materiality
perspective of ESRS described in section 3.
15. Throughout ESRS, the terms that are defined in the glossary of definitions (Annex II) are put in bold italic, except
when a defined term is used more than once in the same paragraph.
16. ESRS structure the information to be disclosed under Disclosure Requirements. Each Disclosure Requirement
consists of one or more distinct datapoints. The term “datapoint” can also refer to a narrative sub-element of a
Disclosure Requirement.
17. In addition to Disclosure Requirements most ESRS also contain Application Requirements. Application
Requirements support the application of Disclosure Requirements and have the same authority as other parts of an
ESRS.
18. ESRS use the following terms to distinguish between different degrees of obligation on the undertaking to disclose
information:
(a) “shall disclose” – indicates that the provision is prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement or datapoint;
(b) “may disclose” – indicates voluntary disclosure to encourage good practice.
In addition, ESRS use the term “shall consider” when referring to issues, resources or methodologies that the
undertaking is expected to take into account or to use in the preparation of a given disclosure if applicable.
2. Qualitative characteristics of information
19. When preparing its sustainability statement, the undertaking shall apply:
(a) the fundamental qualitative characteristics of information, i.e. relevance and faithful representation; and
(b) the enhancing qualitative characteristics of information, i.e. comparability, verifiability and understandability.
20. These qualitative characteristics of information are defined and described in Appendix B of this Standard.
3. Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures
21. The undertaking shall report on sustainability matters based on the double materiality principle as defined and
explained in this chapter.
3.1 Stakeholders and their relevance to the materiality assessment process
22. Stakeholders are those who can affect or be affected by the undertaking. There are two main groups of stakeholders:
(a) affected stakeholders: individuals or groups whose interests are affected or could be affected – positively or
negatively – by the undertaking’s activities and its direct and indirect business relationships across its value
chain; and
(b) users of sustainability statements: primary users of general-purpose financial reporting (existing and potential
investors, lenders and other creditors, including asset managers, credit institutions, insurance undertakings), and other users of sustainability statements, including the undertaking’s business partners, trade unions and social
partners, civil society and non-governmental organisations, governments, analysts and academics.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
