(b) the leakage level is either calculated using the Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI) (  205  ) rating method and the 
threshold value equals to or is lower than 1,5, or is calculated using another appropriate method and the
threshold value is established in accordance with Article 4 of Directive (EU) 2020/2184 of the European
Parliament and of the Council (  206  ). That calculation is to be applied across the extent of water supply 
(distribution) network where the works are carried out, i.e. at water supply zone level, district metered
area(s) (DMAs) or pressure managed area(s) (PMAs).  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  N/A  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
5.2.  Renewal of water collection, treatment and supply systems  
Description of the activity  
Renewal of water collection, treatment and supply systems including renewals to water collection, treatment and
distribution infrastructures for domestic and industrial needs. It implies no material changes to the volume of flow
collected, treated or supplied.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E36.00 and
F42.99 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The renewal of the water supply system leads to improved energy efficiency in one of the following ways:
(a) by decreasing the net average energy consumption of the system by at least 20 % compared to own baseline
performance averaged for three years, including abstraction and treatment, measured in kWh per cubic meter
produced water supply;  
_____________
( 205  ) The Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI) is calculated as current annual real losses (CARL)/unavoidable annual real losses (UAR L): The 
current annual real losses (CARL) represent the amount of water that is actually lost from the distribution network (i.e. not
delivered to final users). The unavoidable annual real losses (UARL) take into consideration that there will always be some lea kage
in a water distribution network. The UARL is calculated based on factors such as the length of the network, the number of servi ce
connections and the pressure at which the network is operating.
