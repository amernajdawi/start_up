(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the provisions of Directive 2000/60/EC, in 
particular with all the requirements laid down in Article 4 of the
Directive. In accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2000/60/EC and in
particular paragraph 7 of that Article, prior to refurbishment/construction,
an impact assessment of the project is carried out to assess all its potential
impacts on the status of water bodies within the same river basin and on
protected habitats and species directly dependent on water, considering in
particular migration corridors, free-flowing rivers or ecosystems close to
undisturbed conditions.
The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data,
including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are
specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the
expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as
compared to its current one.
It assesses, in particular, the cumulated impacts of this new project with
other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin.
On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that the
project is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures,
so that it complies with one of the following requirements:
(a) the project does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the
achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it
relates to,
(b) where the project risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement
of good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such
deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-
benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following:
(i) the overriding reasons in the public interest or the fact that the
benefits expected from the planned navigation infrastructure
project in terms of benefits to climate change mitigation/adap Â­
tation outweigh the costs from deteriorating the status of water
that are accruing to the environment and to society
(ii) the fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected
from the activity cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or
disproportionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that
would lead to a better environmental outcome (such as nature
based solution, alternative location, rehabilitation/refurbishment
of existing infrastructures, or use of technologies not disrupting
river continuity).
All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are
implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected
habitats and species directly dependent on water.
Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the
ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies:
(a) measures to ensure conditions as close as possible to undisturbed
