Emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the latest relevant
best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including:
(a) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for the
manufacture of Large Volume Inorganic Chemicals - Ammonia,
Acids and Fertilisers (  151  ); 
(b) the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste
water and waste gas treatment/management systems in the chemical
sector (  152  ). 
No significant cross-media effects occur.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
3.17.  Manufacture of plastics in primary form  
Description of the activity  
Manufacture resins, plastics materials and non-vulcanisable thermoplastic elastomers, the mixing and blending of
resins on a custom basis, as well as the manufacture of non-customised synthetic resins.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code C20.16 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is a transitional activity as referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU)
2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The activity complies with one of the following criteria:
(a) the plastic in primary form is fully manufactured by mechanical recycling of plastic waste;
(b) where mechanical recycling is not technically feasible or economically viable, the plastic in primary form is
fully manufactured by chemical recycling of plastic waste and the life-cycle GHG emissions of the manu ­
factured plastic, excluding any calculated credits from the production of fuels, are lower than the life-cycle
GHG emissions of the equivalent plastic in primary form manufactured from fossil fuel feedstock. Life-cycle
GHG emissions are calculated using Recommendation 2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using
ISO 14067:2018 (  153  ) or ISO 14064-1:2018 (  154  ). Quantified life-cycle GHG emissions are verified by an 
independent third party.
(c) derived wholly or partially from renewable feedstock (  155  ) and its life-cycle GHG emissions are lower than the 
life-cycle GHG emissions of the equivalent plastics in primary form manufactured from fossil fuel feedstock.
Life-cycle GHG emissions are calculated using Recommendation 2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using
ISO 14067:2018 or ISO 14064-1:2018. Quantified life-cycle GHG emissions are verified by an independent
third party.
