COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2021/2178 of 6 July 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council by specifying the content and presentation of information to be disclosed by undertakings subject to Articles 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU concerning environmentally sustainable economic activities, and specifying the methodology to comply with that disclosure obligation (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (1), and in particular Article 8(4), thereof, Whereas: (1) Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 requires undertakings that are subject to Articles 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (2)to disclose how and to what extent their activities are associated with environmentally sustainable economic activities. Article 8(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 requires non-financial undertakings to disclose information on the proportion of the turnover, capital expenditure and operating expenditure (‘key performance indicators’) of their activities related to assets or processes associated with environmentally sustainable economic activities. That provision, however, does not specify equivalent key performance indicators for financial undertakings, that is credit institutions, asset managers, investment firms and insurance and reinsurance undertakings. It is therefore necessary to supplement Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 to specify the key performance indicators for financial undertakings and further specify the content and presentation of the information to be disclosed by all undertakings and the methodology to comply with that disclosure. (2) It is necessary to ensure a uniform application of the disclosure requirements laid down in Article 8(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 by non-financial undertakings that are subject to Articles 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU. Rules should therefore be laid down to further specify the content and presentation of the information required by Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, including the methodology to comply with those rules. To enable investors and the public to properly assess the proportion of environmentally sustainable economic activities (‘Taxonomy- aligned activities’) of non-financial undertakings, those undertakings should be required to disclose which of their economic activities are Taxonomy-aligned. In addition, it is necessary to disclose to which environmental objectives those activities contribute substantially. Non-financial undertakings should therefore also provide for a breakdown in the key performance indicators of the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned activities based on each environmental objective to which those activities contribute substantially. (3) Turnover, capital expenditure and operating expenditure are irrelevant for assessing the environmental sustainability of financial activities, including lending, investment and insurance. The three key performance indicators for non- financial undertakings laid down in Article 8(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 are therefore not appropriate to demonstrate to what extent the economic activities of financial undertakings are -Taxonomy-aligned. It is therefore necessary to provide specific key performance indicators and calculation methodologies for such key performance indicators for financial undertakings. To support markets’ understanding of those key performance indicators, any disclosures of those key performance indicators should be accompanied by qualitative information to enable financial undertakings to explain their determination of key performance indicators. (1)Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector (OJ L 317, 9.12.2019, p. 1). (2)Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19).EN Official Journal of the European Union 10.12.2021 L 443/9

(4) Investors and the public should be able to assess the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities pursued by investee undertakings. Asset managers should therefore disclose the proportion of investments they made in Taxonomy-aligned economic activities in the value of all investments managed by them resulting from both their collective and individual portfolio management activities. That proportion of Taxonomy-aligned investments should be calculated asthe proportion of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities of investee undertakings which results from their respective key performance indicators, because those key performance indicators reflect the environmental performance of investee undertakings. (5) The main activity of credit institutions is the provision of financing to and investments in the real economy. The exposures of credit institutions to undertakings that they finance or invest in are reflected as assets in the credit institutions’ balance sheet. The main key performance indicator for credit institutions that are subject to the disclosure obligations laid down in Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU should be the green asset ratio (GAR), which shows the proportion of exposures related to Taxonomy-aligned activities compared to the total assets of those credit institutions. The GAR should relate to the credit institutions’ main lending and investment business, including loans, advances and debt securities, and to their equity holdings to reflect the extent to which those institutions finance Taxonomy-aligned activities. (6) Credit institutions also perform other commercial services and activities than the provision of financing. Those activities generate fees and commission income. It is necessary to enable investors and the public to assess the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities pursued by the recipients of those services. Credit institutions that are subject to the disclosure obligations laid down in Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU should therefore also disclose what proportion of their fees and commission income is derived from commercial services and activities that are associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities of their clients. (7) Credit institutions may manage underlying assets or provide financial guarantees, leading to off-balance-sheet exposures. To enable investors and the public to assess the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned activities pursued by credit institutions, for those off-balance-sheet exposures, credit institutions that are subject to the disclosure obligations laid down in Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU should disclose the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned activities in the underlying assets that they manage or in the obligations the performance of which they guarantee. (8) In addition to disclosures concerning their banking book, credit institutions that are subject to the disclosure obligations laid down in Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU should also disclose separately the overall composition of their total assets, including their trading book, and any trends and limits in terms of climate and environmental risks. Credit institutions with a significant trading activity should be subject to obligations for more granulardisclosures for their trading book. (9) It is important to provide investors and the public with a complete overview of which investments an investment firm that is subject to the disclosure obligations laid down in Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU has made in Taxonomy-aligned activities. The key performance indicators for such investment firms should therefore cover both their dealing on own account and their dealing on behalf of clients. The disclosure of the key performance indicator for dealing on own account should reflect which proportion of the total assets is composed of assets related to Taxonomy-aligned activities. That indicator should focus on the investment firms’ investments, includingdebt securities and equity instruments in investee companies. The key performance indicator for the environmental sustainability of investment firms’ services and activities on behalf of all their clients should be based on the revenue in the form of fees, commissions and other monetary benefits that investment firms generate from their investment services and activities carried out for their clients. (10) The key performance indicators for insurance and reinsurance undertakings that are subject to the disclosure obligations laid down in Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU should capture their non-life underwriting activities and investment policy that are part of their business model to show the extent to which those activities are aligned with the Taxonomy. One key performance indicator should relate to the investment policy of such insurance and reinsurance undertakings for the funds collected from their underwriting activities and should show the proportion of assets invested in Taxonomy-aligned activities in their overall assets. A second indicator should relate EN Official Journal of the European Union L 443/10 10.12.2021 

--- Page 3 of 59 ---

to the underwriting activities themselves and show what proportion of the overall non-life underwriting activities is composed of non-life underwriting activities that relate to climate adaptation and which are performed in accordance with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 (3)(‘Climate Delegated Act’). (11) Financial undertakings that are subject to the disclosure obligations laid down in Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU should not take into account the exposure to, or investments in, non-financial undertakings that are not subject to Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU in the calculation of the numerator of key performance indicators. An inclusion of such exposures in the numerator may be considered at the time of review of this Delegated Act which will be accompanied by an impact assessment. Those non-financial undertakings may still decide to voluntarily disclose their key performance indicators, either to have access to environmentally sustainable finance as part of specific eco-labelling schemes and environmentally sustainable financial products, or as part of their overall business strategy based on environmental sustainability. (12) In view of the entry into force and application of Climate Delegated Act by the end of 2021 and material difficulties for assessing compliance of economic activities in 2022 with technical screening criteria laid down in that Delegated Regulation for the previous reporting year, the application of this Regulation in 2022 should be limited to certain elements and qualitative reporting, with the remaining provisions starting to apply from 1 January 2023 for non- financial undertakings and from 1 January 2024 for financial undertakings. Moreover, the key performance indicators of credit institutions related to their trading book and commission and fees for other commercial services and activities than the provision of financing should apply from 1 January 2026. (13) Due to the current lack of an appropriate calculation methodology, exposures to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers should be excluded from the calculation of the numerator and denominator of key performance indicators. Financial undertakings may, on a voluntary basis, provide information in relation to exposures to taxonomy aligned bonds and taxonomy aligned debt securities that are issued by central governments, central banks or supranational issuers. There should be a review by 30 June 2024 that should evaluate the possibility of inclusion of such exposures in the key performance indicators, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Definitions For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions apply: (1) ‘environmental objective’ means one of the environmental objectives laid down in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852; (2) ‘Taxonomy-aligned economic activity’ means an economic activity that complies with the requirements laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852; (3) ‘transitional economic activity’ means an economic activity that complies with the requirements laid down in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852; (4) ‘enabling economic activity’ means an economic activity that complies with the requirements laid down in Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852; (3)Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of 4 June 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation and for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives (OJ L 442, 9.12.2021, p. 1).EN Official Journal of the European Union 10.12.2021 L 443/11

ANNEX I KPIs OF NON-FINANCIAL UNDERTAKINGS 1. Content of KPIs to be disclosed by non-financial undertakings 1.1. Specification of key performance indicators (KPI) 1.1.1. KPI related to turnover (turnover KPI) The proportion of turnover referred to in Article 8(2), point (a), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 shall be calculated as the part of the net turnover derived from products or services, including intangibles, associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities (numerator), divided by the net turnover (denominator) as defined in Article 2, point (5), of Directive 2013/34/EU. The turnover shall cover the revenue recognised pursuant to International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1, paragraph 82(a), as adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 (1). The KPI referred to in the first subparagraph shall exclude from its numerator the part of the net turnover derived from products and services associated with economic activities that have been adapted to climate change in line with Article 11(1), point (a) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and in accordance with Annex II to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139, unless those activities: (a) qualify as enabling activities in accordance with Article 11(1), point (b) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852; or (b) are themselves Taxonomy-aligned. 1.1.2. KPI related to capital expenditure (CapEx) (CapEx KPI) The proportion of CapEx referred to in Article 8(2), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 shall be calculated as the numerator divided by the denominator as specified in points 1.1.2.1 and 1.1.2.2 of this Annex. 1.1.2.1. Denominator The denominator shall cover additions to tangible and intangible assets during the financial year considered before depreciation, amortisation and any re-measurements, including those resulting from revaluations and impairments, for the relevant financial year and excluding fair value changes. The denominator shall also cover additions to tangible and intangible assets resulting from business combinations. For non-financial undertakings applying international financial reporting standards (IFRS) as adopted by Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008, CapEx shall cover costs that are accounted based on: (a) IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, paragraphs 73, (e), point (i) and point (iii); (b) IAS 38 Intangible Assets, paragraph 118, (e), point (i); (c) IAS 40 Investment Property, paragraphs 76, points (a) and (b) (for the fair value model); (d) IAS 40 Investment Property, paragraph 79(d), points (i) and (ii) (for the cost model); (e) IAS 41 Agriculture, paragraph 50, points (b) and (e); (f) IFRS 16 Leases, paragraph 53, point (h). For non-financial undertakings applying national generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), CapEx shall cover the costs accounted under the applicable GAAP that correspond to the costs included in the capital expenditure by non- financial undertakings applying IFRS. Leases that do not lead to the recognition of a right-of-use over the asset shall not be counted as CapEx. (1)Commission Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 of 3 November 2008 adopting certain international accounting standards in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 320, 29.11.2008, p. 1).EN Official Journal of the European Union 10.12.2021 L 443/17

1.1.2.2. Numerator The numerator equals to the part of the capital expenditure included in the denominator that is any of the following: (a) related to assets or processes that are associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities; (b) part of a plan to expand Taxonomy-aligned economic activities or to allow Taxonomy-eligible economic activities to become Taxonomy-aligned (‘CapEx plan’) under the conditions specified in the second subparagraph of this point 1.1.2.2; (c) related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and individual measures enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions, notably activities listed in points 7.3 to 7.6 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act, as well as other economic activities listed in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 10(3), Article 11(3), Article 12(2), Article 13(2), Article 14(2) and Article 15(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and provided that such measures are implemented and operational within 18 months. The CapEx plan referred to in the first paragraph of this point 1.1.2.2 shall meet the following conditions: (a) the plan aims either to expand the undertaking’s Taxonomy-aligned economic activities or to upgrade Taxonomy- eligible economic activities to render them Taxonomy-aligned within a period of five years; (b) the plan shall be disclosed at economic activity aggregated level and be approved by the management body of non- financial undertakings either directly or by delegation. Where the relevant technical screening criteria are amended before the completion of the CapEx plan, non-financial undertakings shall either update the plan within two years to ensure the economic activities referred to in point (a) are aligned with the amended technical screening criteria upon the completion of the plan or restate the numerator of the CapEx KPI. The updating of plan shall restart the period referred to in point (a). The period referred to point (a) of the second paragraph of this point 1.1.2.2 can exceed five years only where a longer period is objectively justified by specific features of the economic activity and the upgrade concerned, with a maximum of 10 years.

The definition of the KPIs shall be based on the following components: (a) the numerator, which shall cover the loans and advances, debt securities, equities and repossessed collaterals, financing Taxonomy-aligned economic activities based on turnover KPI and CapEx KPI of underlying assets; (b) the denominator, which shall cover the total loans and advances, total debt securities, total equities and total repossessed collaterals and all other covered on-balance sheet assets. In addition to GAR, credit institutions shall disclose the percentage of their total assets that are excluded from the numerator of the GAR in accordance with Article 7(2) of this Regulation and point1.1.2 of this Annex. 1.2.1.1. GAR applying to exposures to non-financial undertakings Credit institutions shall disclose the GAR for the stock of loans, debt securities and equity holdings and the flow for new lending. Credit institutions shall follow the following steps to calculate the GAR for each environmental objective.

Stock and flow Other environmental activities Same ratios for each of the other four environmental objectives should be disclosed, once the screening criteria are defined. That is: the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; the transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. (i) GAR for lending activities to equity holdings of non-financial undertakings for loans and advances (GAR L&A) Credit institutions shall use and disclose the following items for the calculation of the GAR for this type of exposures: (1)(a) total loans and advances to non-financial undertakings, including loans and advances recognised under the accounting categories referred to in point 1.2 of this Annex, that is the gross carrying amount of: (i) loans and advances at amortised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income; (ii) loans and advances not held for trading at fair value through profit or loss. (1)(b) loans and advances to non-financial undertakings financing Taxonomy-eligible economic activities for each environmental objective, including the gross carrying amount of loans and advances in the relevant accounting categories towards companies carrying out taxonomy-eligible economic activities (where available, 4 level Nomenclature of Economic Activities (NACE) codes) relevant for each environmental objective. (1)(c) loans and advances to non-financial undertakings financing taxonomy-aligned economic activities for each environmental objective, including all loans and advances financing taxonomy-aligned economic activities, including subsets of transitional and enabling economic activities. The amount for the purpose of (1)(c) shall be calculated by using the following formula 1(c) = (1)(c)(1) + (1)(c)(2) where: (1)(c)(1) represents loans and advances where the use of proceeds is known, including specialised lending – project finance loans as referred to in Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 (1); (1)(c)(2) represents loans and advances where the use of proceeds is unknown (general loans). For the purposes of point (1)(c)(1), credit institutions shall consider the gross carrying amount of the project finance exposures to the non-financial undertaking to the extent and proportion that the project funded finances a taxonomy- aligned economic activity. The assessment of whether that requirement has been complied with shall be based on information provided by the counterparty on the project or activities to which the proceeds will be applied. Credit institutions shall provide information on the type of economic activity that is funded. Double counting shall not be allowed. Where the same specialised lending exposure is relevant for two environmental objectives, credit institutions shall allocate it to the most relevant objective. For the purposes of point (1)(c)(2), credit institutions shall rely on the CapEx and turnover KPI that the counterparty shall disclose for each environmental objective in accordance with this Regulation. The amount of loans and advances to non- financial undertakings shall be the sum of the gross carrying amount of the total loans and advances with unknown use of proceeds to non-financial undertakings weighted by the proportion of taxonomy-aligned economic activities with a breakdown for transition and enabling activities for each counterparty. Credit institutions shall calculate the KPIs for those type of exposures as follows: First step = (1)(b)/(1)(a).
