Disclosure Requirement E1-8 – Internal carbon pricing
AR 65. When disclosing the information required under paragraphs 62 and 63, if applicable, the undertaking shall briefly
explain whether and how the carbon prices used in internal carbon pricing schemes are consistent with those used
in financial statements. This shall be done in respect of the internal carbon prices used for,
(a) the assessment of the useful life and residual value of its assets (intangibles, property, plant and equipment);
(b) the impairment of assets; and
(c) the fair value measurement of assets acquired through business acquisitions.
AR 66. The information may be presented by using the following table:

Disclosure Requirement E1-9 – Anticipated financial effects from material physical and transition risks and potential
climate-related opportunities
Anticipated financial effects from material physical and transition risks
AR 67. Material climate-related physical risks and transition risks may affect the undertaking’s financial position (e.g.,
owned assets, financially-controlled leased assets, and liabilities), performance (e.g., potential
future increase/decrease in net revenue and costs due to business interruptions, increased supply prices resulting
in potential margin erosions), and cash flows. The low probability, high severity and long-term time horizons of
some climate- related physical risk exposures and the uncertainty arising from the transition to a sustainable
economy mean that there will be associated material anticipated financial effects that are outside the scope of
the requirements of applicable accounting standards.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
