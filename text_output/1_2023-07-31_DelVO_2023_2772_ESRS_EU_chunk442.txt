AR 41. The undertaking may explain whether any such initiatives are designed also to support the achievement of one or more Sustainable Development Goals. For example, an undertaking committing to SDG 8 to “promote sustained,
inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all” may be
actively working towards eliminating forced labour or compulsory labour or supporting higher levels of
productivity on activities in developing countries through technological upgrades and training of local labour,
which can benefit both the specific people in its own workforce targeted by the actions, and also their local
communities.
AR 42. When disclosing the intended or achieved positive outcomes of its actions for the undertaking’s own workforce, a
distinction is to be made between evidence of certain activities having occurred (for example, that x number of
people have received financial literacy training) from evidence of actual outcomes for the people concerned (for
example, that x people report that they are able to better manage their pay and their household budgets).
AR 43. If the undertaking has taken measures to mitigate negative impacts on its own workforce that arise from the
transition to a greener, climate-neutral economy, such as training and reskilling, employment guarantees, and in
the case of downscaling or mass dismissal, measures such as job counselling, coaching, intra-company
placements and early retirement plans, the undertaking shall disclose those measures. This includes measures to OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
