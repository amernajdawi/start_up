[128]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard
Table [C.1]  Data management plan checklist
Component Information Rationale
Responsibilities Name and contact details of persons
responsible for:
• Management of product inventory
• Data collection for each process
• Internal review or audit procedures
• Assurance proceduresThis ensures institutional knowledge
is maintained and allows relevant
person(s) to be identified as
accountable for:
• Confirming and checking
information during any internal or
external audit procedures
• Producing consistent future
product inventory
Product description • Description of the product and
functional unitTo provide internal auditors, assurance
providers, and those doing future
product inventories, with information
on the product/functional unit
Inventory boundary • Inventory boundary description (e.g.,
cradle-to-grave or cradle-to-gate)
• How the boundary was derived
• Attributable processes included in the
inventory
• Attributable processes excluded from
the inventory (including rationale for
exclusion)
• Information on how the product
use and end-of-life profile was
determinedTo provide internal auditors, assurance
providers, and those doing future
product inventories with sufficient
information to understand and
replicate boundary decisions
Allocation • Allocation methodologies used and
where they were usedTo provide internal auditors, assurance
providers, and those doing future
product inventories with sufficient
information to understand and
replicate allocation decisions
• Data collection procedures, including
data sources for each processRecords all data sources and allows
others to locate data sources (for audit
or future product inventories). Also
provides information on what suppliers
have been approached for data
• How data quality assessment and
uncertainty assessment were
undertakenEnables data quality to be tracked over
time and improvedData summary

Table [C.1]  Data management plan checklist (continued)
Component Information Rationale
• Data sources where better quality
data is preferable and plan for how to
improve that dataIdentifies where data sources should
be improved over time (e.g., needed
emissions for laptop computer but
could only obtain desktop computer
information), including those suppliers
who were asked to provide data and
those that were not
• Criteria used to determine when
an inventory is to be re-evaluated,
including the relevant information,
changes to the system to be tracked
over time, and how these changes
should be trackedThis allows data and information
sources to be tracked and compared
over time. It may also involve
identifying a system (e.g., document
tracking and identification system) to
ensure data and information is easily
located and under what conditions
this information/data was used  
or collected
• Calculation methodologies used
(and references). This includes
documenting where the calculation
methodology for any data used was
not available.Provides internal auditors, assurance
providers, and those doing future
product inventories with details on
how emissions were calculated
Inventory results
calculations• Calculation methodologies and
changes in methodologies over timeNoting methodological changes allows
for easier baseline recalculation when
tracking inventory improvements
• GWP values used Allows for consistency over time
Performance tracking • When tracking performance, details
of the base inventory adjustment
policyPrescribes clearly a trigger for
adjusting a base inventory enabling
tracking of performance over time
Data storage  
procedures• How and where data is stored Allows information to be easily located
• Length of time data is to be archived Keeps a record of how long
information is stored to prevent
looking for information that is no
longer kept
• Backup procedures Ensures backup procedures are
implemented
QA/QC procedures • QA/QC procedures used  
(see table C.2 for detailed guidance)Ensures that adequate processes are
in place to check data collection, input
and handling, data documentation, and
emissions calculationsData summary
