AR 26. Where the undertaking describes progress in achieving the objectives of a policy in the absence of a measurable target, it may specify a baseline against which the progress is considered. For example, the undertaking may assess an increase of wages by a certain percentage for those below a fair wage; or may assess the quality of its relationships with local communities by reference to the proportion of issues raised by communities that were resolved to their satisfaction. The baseline and the assessment of the progress shall be related to the impacts, risks and opportunities which underpin the materiality of the matter addressed by the policy.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
