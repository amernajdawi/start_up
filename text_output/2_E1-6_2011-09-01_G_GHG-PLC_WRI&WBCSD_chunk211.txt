GlossaryGlobal warming potential  A factor used to calculate the cumulative radiative forcing impact of multiple specific  
 (GWP)  GHGs in a comparable way.10
Indirect land-use change  When the demand for a specific land use induces a carbon stock change on other lands.
Insignificance threshold  The threshold below which a process, input, or output can be considered insignificant to 
the studied product’s life cycle inventory.
Intermediate products  Goods that are used as inputs to the production of other goods or services.
Inventory report  The full reporting requirements, plus any optional information, reported publicly in 
conformance with the Product Standard .
Inventory results  The GHG impact of the studied product per unit of analysis. 
Land use categories  Forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements and other lands.11
Land-use change  Occurs when the demand for a specific land use results in a change in carbon stocks 
on that land, due to either a conversion from one land-use category to another or a
conversion within a land-use category.
Land-use change impacts  Emissions and removals due to land-use change.
Level of assurance  The degree of confidence stakeholders can have over the information in the  
inventory report.
Life cycle  Consecutive and interlinked stages of a product system, from raw material acquisition or 
generation of natural resources to end-of-life.
Life cycle assessment  Compilation and evaluation of inputs, outputs and potential environmental impacts of a 
product system throughout its lifecycle.12
Life cycle stage  A useful categorization of the interconnected steps in a product’s life cycle for the 
purposes of organizing processes, data collection, and inventory results.
Material acquisition and  A life cycle stage that begins when resources are extracted from nature and ends when  
 pre-processing stage  the product components enter the gate of the studied product’s production facility.
Material misstatement  Individual or aggregate errors, omissions, and misrepresentations that significantly 
impact the GHG inventory results and could influence a user’s decisions.
Non-attributable processes  Processes and services, materials and energy flows are not directly connected to the 
studied product because they do not become the product, make the product, or directly
carry the product through its life cycle.
