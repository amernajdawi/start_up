Building components and materials used in the construction that may
come into contact with occupiers (  289  ) emit less than 0,06 mg of formal ­
dehyde per m  3 of material or component upon testing in accordance with 
the conditions specified in Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006
and less than 0,001 mg of other categories 1A and 1B carcinogenic
volatile organic compounds per m  3 of material or component, upon 
testing in accordance with CEN/EN 16516 (  290  ) or ISO 16000-3:2011 (  291  ) 
or other equivalent standardised test conditions and determination
methods (  292  ). 
Where the new construction is located on a potentially contaminated site
(brownfield site), the site has been subject to an investigation for potential
contaminants, for example using standard ISO 18400 (  293  ). 
Measures are taken to reduce noise, dust and pollutant emissions during
construction or maintenance works.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.
The new construction is not built on one of the following:
(a) arable land and crop land with a moderate to high level of soil fertility
and below ground biodiversity as referred to the EU LUCAS
survey (  294  ); 
(b) greenfield land of recognised high biodiversity value and land that
serves as habitat of endangered species (flora and fauna) listed on
the European Red List (  295  ) or the IUCN Red List (  296  ); 
(c) land matching the definition of forest as set out in national law used
in the national greenhouse gas inventory, or where not available, is in
accordance with the FAO definition of forest (  297  ). 
7.2.  Renovation of existing buildings  
Description of the activity  
Construction and civil engineering works or preparation thereof.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular F41 and F43 in
accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is a transitional activity as referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU)
2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.
