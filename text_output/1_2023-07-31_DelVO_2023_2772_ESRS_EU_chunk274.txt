ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 274/284Own workforce/own workers Employees who are in an employment relationship with the undertaking
(‘employees’) and non-employees who are either individual contractors
supplying labour to the undertaking (‘self-employed people’) or people
provided by undertakings primarily engaged in ‘employment activities’
(NACE Code N78).
Ozone-depleting substances Substances listed in the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the
Ozone Layer.
Packaging Products made of any materials of any nature to be used for the
containment, protection, handling, delivery, storage, transport and
presentation of goods, from raw materials to processed goods, from the
producer to the user or consumer (21).
Pay The ordinary basic or minimum wage or salary and any other remuneration,
whether in cash or in kind which the worker receives directly or indirectly
(‘complementary or variable components’), in respect of his/her
employment from his/her employer. ‘Pay level’ means gross annual pay
and the corresponding gross hourly pay. ‘Median pay level’ means the pay
of the employee that would have half of the employees earn more and half
less than they do.
Persons with disabilities Persons who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their
full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.
Physical risks All global economic enterprise depends on the functioning of earth systems,
such as a stable climate and on ecosystem services, such as the provision of
biomass (raw materials). Nature-related physical risks are a direct result of
an organisation’s dependence on nature. Physical risks arise when natural
systems are compromised, due to the impact of climatic events (e.g., extremes of weather such as a drought), geologic events (e.g., seismic
events such as an earthquake) events or changes in ecosystem equilibria,
such as soil quality or marine ecology, which affect the ecosystem services
organisations depend on. These can be acute, chronic, or both. Nature-
related physical risks arise as a result of changes in the biotic (living) and
abiotic (non-living) conditions that support healthy, functioning
ecosystems . Physical risks are usually location-specific. Nature-related
physical risks are often associated with climate-related physical risks.
Planetary boundaries This concept allows to estimate a safe operating space for humanity with respect to the functioning of the Earth. The boundary level for each key
Earth System process that should not be transgressed if we are to avoid
unacceptable global environmental change, is quantified.
Policy A set or framework of general objectives and management principles that
the undertaking uses for decision-making. A policy implements the
undertaking’s strategy or management decisions related to a material sustainability matter. Each policy is under the responsibility of defined
person(s), specifies its perimeter of application, and includes one or more objectives (linked when applicable to measurable targets). A policy is
validated and reviewed following the undertakings’ applicable governance rules. A policy is implemented through actions or action plans.
