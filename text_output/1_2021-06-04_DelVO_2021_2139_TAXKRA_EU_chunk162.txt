Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The infrastructure that is constructed and operated is dedicated to personal mobility or cycle logistics: pavements,
bike lanes and pedestrian zones, electrical charging and hydrogen refuelling installations for personal mobility
devices.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.

Commission Decision 2000/532/EC (  271  )) generated on the construction 
site is prepared for reuse, recycling and other material recovery, including
backfilling operations using waste to substitute other materials, in
accordance with the waste hierarchy and the EU Construction and
Demolition Waste Management Protocol (  272  ). Operators limit waste 
generation in processes related to construction and demolition, in
accordance with the EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management
Protocol, taking into account best available techniques and using selective
demolition to enable removal and safe handling of hazardous substances
and facilitate reuse and high-quality recycling by selective removal of
materials, using available sorting systems for construction and demolition
waste.
