built before 31 December 2020 and at least distinguishes between resi ­
dential and non-residential buildings.
For buildings built after 31 December 2020, the Primary Energy Demand
(PED) (  617  ) defining the energy performance of the building resulting from 
the construction does not exceed the threshold set for the nearly zero-
energy building (NZEB) requirements in national regulation implementing
Directive 2010/31/EU. The energy performance is certified using an as
built Energy Performance Certificate (EPC).

( 615  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta n­
eously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more
diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-eff icient
and systemic interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of
ecosystem services (version of 4.6.2021: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/nature-
based-solutions_en/).
