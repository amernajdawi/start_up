confidence interval (5 percent to 95 percent of
the distribution). This is based on information
provided in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report,
and the range given is to reflect the uncertainty
in converting individual GHG emissions into units
of CO2e. As identified in the requirements section
10.2, companies are required to report the source
of GWP values used. If companies choose to
quantify inventory uncertainty they may include the
uncertainty of GWP values in their calculations. Box [10.1]   Uncertainty of global warming
