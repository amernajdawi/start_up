1.7 Limitations  of product GHG inventories
The Product Standard  accounts for the GHG emissions 
and removals that occur during a product’s life cycle. A
product assessment limited to only GHGs has the benefit
of simplifying the analysis and producing results that can
be clearly communicated to stakeholders. The limitation
of a GHG-only inventory is that potential trade-offs or co-
benefits between environmental impacts can be missed.
Therefore, the results of a GHG-only inventory should
not be used to communicate the overall environmental
performance of a product. Non-GHG environmental
impacts that occur during the life cycle of a product should
also be considered when making decisions to reduce GHG
emissions based on the inventory results. Examples of
potentially significant non-GHG impacts for some products
include ecosystem degradation, resource depletion, ozone
depletion, and negative human health impacts. Endnotes

2   In this standard, both emissions to the atmosphere and removals 
from the atmosphere are accounted for in order to calculate
the total GHG inventory of a product. Removals of CO2 generally
occur during photosynthesis.
3   The term company is used throughout the standard to represent 
a company or organization that may use the standard.
4   A scope 3 category is one of 15 types of scope 3 emissions 
organized by activities that occur upstream and downstream
from a company’s ownership or control.
Moreover, while this standard focuses solely on GHG
emissions and removals, the accounting requirements
and guidance provided can be used to collect data for
other environmental impacts. Companies wishing to
include non-GHG impacts along with their GHG inventory
can do so using the same steps and methodologies
provided in this standard. material acquisition
