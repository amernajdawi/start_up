Cross-sector (ACA) reductions pathway based on the year 2020 as
the reference year- 42% - 90%

AR 29. The reference target value is dependent on the base year and baseline emissions of the undertaking’s GHG
emission reduction target. As a result, the reference target value for undertakings with a recent base year or from
higher baseline emissions may be less challenging to achieve than it will be for undertakings that have already
taken ambitious past actions to reduce GHG emissions. Therefore, undertakings that have in the past achieved
GHG emissions reductions compatible with either a 1.5°C-aligned cross-sector or sector-specific pathway, may
adjust their baseline emissions accordingly to determine the reference target value. Accordingly, if the undertaking
is adjusting the baseline emissions to determine the reference target value, it shall not consider GHG emission
reductions that precede the year 2020 and it shall provide appropriate evidence of its past achieved GHG
emission reduction.
AR 30. When disclosing the information required under paragraph 34 (f), the undertaking shall explain:
(a) by reference to its climate change mitigation actions, the decarbonisation levers and their estimated
quantitative contributions to the achievement of its GHG emission reduction targets broken down by each
Scope (1, 2 and 3);
(b) whether it plans to adopt new technologies and the role of these to achieve its GHG emission reduction
targets; and
(c) whether and how it has considered a diverse range of climate scenarios, at least including a climate scenario
compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5°C, to detect relevant environmental-, societal-, technology-,
market- and policy-related developments and determine its decarbonisation levers.
AR 31. The undertaking may present its GHG emission reduction targets together with its climate change mitigation
actions (see paragraph AR 19) as a table or graphical pathway showing developments over time. The following
figure and table provide examples combining targets and decarbonisation levers:
