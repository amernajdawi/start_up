4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other
people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  225  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  226  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  The plastic in primary form is one of the following: 
(a) fully manufactured by mechanical recycling of plastic waste;
(b) where mechanical recycling is not possible, fully manufactured by
chemical recycling of plastic waste where the life-cycle greenhouse
gas emissions of the manufactured plastic, excluding any calculated
credits from the production of fuels, are lower than the life-cycle
greenhouse gas emissions of the equivalent primary plastic manu ­
factured from fossil fuel feedstock. Life-cycle greenhouse gas
emissions are calculated using Recommendation 2013/179/EU or,
alternatively, using ISO 14067:2018 (  227  ) or ISO 14064-1:2018 (  228  ). 
Quantified life-cycle GHG emissions are verified by an independent
third party.
(c) derived wholly or partially from renewable feedstock (  229  ) where the 
life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of the manufactured plastic in
primary form, manufactured wholly or partially from renewable feed ­
stock, is lower than the life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of the
equivalent plastics in primary form manufactured from fossil fuel feed ­
stock. Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions are calculated using Recom ­
mendation 2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using ISO 14067:2018 or
ISO 14064-1:2018. Quantified life-cycle GHG emissions are verified
by an independent third party.

( 225  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta neously 
provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse,
nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient an d
systemic interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosyste m
services (version of 4.6.2021: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/nature-based-solutio ns_
en/).
