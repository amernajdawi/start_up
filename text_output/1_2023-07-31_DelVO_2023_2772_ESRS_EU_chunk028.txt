ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 25/284AR 7. Nature may be considered as a silent stakeholder . In this case, ecological data and data on the conservation of
species may support the undertaking’s materiality assessment.
AR 8. Materiality assessment is informed by dialogue with affected stakeholders. The undertaking may engage with
affected stakeholders or their representatives (such as employees or trade unions), along with users of
sustainability reporting and other experts, to provide inputs or feedback on its conclusions regarding its material
impacts, risks and opportunities.
Assessment of impact materiality
AR 9. In assessing impact materiality and determining the material matters to be reported, the undertaking shall
consider the following three steps:
(a) understanding of the context in relation to its impacts including its activities, business relationships, and
stakeholders;
(b) identification of actual and potential impacts (both negative and positive), including through engaging with stakeholders and experts. In this step, the undertaking may rely on scientific and analytical research on
impacts on sustainability matters;
(c) assessment of the materiality of its actual and potential impacts and determination of the material matters. In
this step, the undertaking shall adopt thresholds to determine which of the impacts will be covered in its
sustainability statement.
Characteristics of severity
AR 10. The severity is determined by the following factors:
(a) scale: how grave the negative impact is or how beneficial the positive impact is for people or the environment;
(b) scope: how widespread the negative or positive impacts are. In the case of environmental impacts, the scope
may be understood as the extent of environmental damage or a geographical perimeter. In the case of impacts
on people, the scope may be understood as the number of people adversely affected; and
(c) irremediable character: whether and to what extent the negative impacts could be remediated, i.e., restoring the
environment or affected people to their prior state.
AR 11. Any of the three characteristics (scale, scope, and irremediable character) can make a negative impact severe. In the
case of a potential negative human rights impact, the severity of the impact takes precedence over its likelihood.
Impacts connected with the undertaking
AR 12. As an illustration:
(a) if the undertaking uses cobalt in its products that is mined using child labour, the negative impact (i.e., child
labour) is connected with the undertaking’s products through the tiers of business relationships in its
upstream value chain. These relationships include the smelter and minerals trader and the mining enterprise
that uses child labour; and
(b) if the undertaking provides financial loans to an enterprise for business activities that, in breach of agreed
standards, result in the contamination of water and land surrounding the operations, this negative impact is
connected with the undertaking through its relationship with the enterprise it provides the loans to.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
