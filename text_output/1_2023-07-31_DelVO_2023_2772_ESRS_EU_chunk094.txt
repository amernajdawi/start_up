ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 96/284(8) Fuel consumption for renewable sources, including biomass (also
comprising industrial and municipal waste of biologic origin, biogas,
renewable hydrogen, etc.) (MWh)
(9) Consumption of purchased or acquired electricity, heat, steam, and cooling from renewable sources (MWh)
(10) The consumption of self-generated non-fuel renewable energy (MWh)
(11) Total renewable energy consumption (MWh) (calculated as the
sum of lines 8 to 10)
Share of renewable sources in total  
energy consumption (%)
Total energy consumption (MWh) (calculated as the sum of lines 6,
and 11)
AR 35. The total energy consumption with a distinction between fossil, nuclear and renewable energy consumption may be presented graphically in the sustainability statement showing developments over time (e.g., through a pie or
bar chart).
Energy intensity based on net revenue
Calculation guidance
AR 36. When preparing the information on energy intensity required under paragraph 40, the undertaking shall:
(a) calculate the energy intensity ratio using the following formula:
(b) express the total energy consumption in MWh and the net revenue in monetary units (e.g., Euros);
(c) the numerator and denominator shall only consist of the proportion of the total final energy consumption (in
the numerator) and net revenue (in the denominator) that are attributable to activities in high climate impact
sectors
. In effect, there should be consistency in the scope of both the numerator and denominator;
(d) calculate the total energy consumption in line with the requirement in paragraph 37;
(e) calculate the net revenue in line with the accounting standards requirements applicable for the financial
statements, i.e., IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers or local GAAP requirements.
AR 37. The quantitative information may be presented in the following table.
