ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 15/28472. The incorporation of estimates made using sector-average data or other proxies shall not result in information that
does not meet the qualitative characteristics of information (see chapter 2 and section 7.2 Sources of estimation and
outcome uncertainty of this Standard).
6. Time horizons
6.1 Reporting period
73. The reporting period for the undertaking’s sustainability statement shall be consistent with that of its financial
statements.
6.2 Linking past, present and future
74. The undertaking shall establish appropriate linkages in its sustainability statement between retrospective and
forward-looking information, when relevant, to foster a clear understanding of how historical information relates to future-oriented information.
6.3 Reporting progress against the base year
75. A base year is the historical reference date or period for which information is available and against which subsequent
information can be compared over time.
76. The undertaking shall present comparative information in respect of the base year for amounts reported in the current period when reporting the developments and progress towards a target, unless the relevant Disclosure
Requirement already defines how to report progress. The undertaking may also include historical information about
achieved milestones between the base year and the reporting period when this is relevant information.
6.4 Definition of short-, medium- and long-term for reporting purposes
77. When preparing its sustainability statement, the undertaking shall adopt the following time intervals as of the end
of the reporting period:
(a) for the short-term time horizon: the period adopted by the undertaking as the reporting period in its financial
statements;
(b) for the medium-term time horizon: from the end of the short-term reporting period defined in (a) up to 5 years;
and
(c) for the long-term time horizon: more than 5 years.
78. The undertaking shall use an additional breakdown for the long-term time horizon when impacts or actions are
expected in a period longer than 5 years if necessary to provide relevant information to users of sustainability
statements.
79. If different definitions of medium- or long-term time horizons are required for specific items of disclosure in other
ESRS, the definitions in those ESRS shall prevail.
80. There may be circumstances where the use of the medium- or long-term time horizons defined in paragraph 77 results in non-relevant information, as the undertaking uses a different definition for (i) its processes of identification
and management of material impacts, risks and opportunities or (ii) the definition of its actions and setting targets.
These circumstances may be due to industry-specific characteristics, such as cash flow and business cycles, the expected duration of capital investments, the time horizons over which the users of sustainability statements
conduct their assessments or the planning horizons typically used in the undertaking’s industry for decision-making.
In these circumstances, the undertaking may adopt a different definition of medium- and/or long- term time horizons
(see ESRS 2 BP–2, paragraph 9).
81. References to “short-term”, “medium-term”, and “long-term” in ESRS refer to the time horizon as determined by the undertaking according to the provisions in paragraphs 77 to 80.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
