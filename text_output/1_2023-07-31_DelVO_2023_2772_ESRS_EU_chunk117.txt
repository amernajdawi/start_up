transition away from substances of concern;
iii. market: e.g., shifting supply, demand and financing, volatility or increased costs of some substances; and
iv. reputation: e.g., changing societal, customer or community perceptions as a result of an organisation’s role
in pollution prevention and control;
(b) identify physical risks, e.g., sudden interruption of access to clean water, acid rain, or other pollution incidents
that are likely to lead to or that have led to pollution with subsequent effects on the environment and society;
(c) identify opportunities related to pollution prevention and control categorised by:
i. resource efficiency: decrease quantities of substances used or improve efficiency of production process to
minimise impacts;
ii. markets: e.g., diversification of business activities;
iii. financing: e.g., access to green funds, bonds or loans;
iv. resilience: e.g., diversification of substances used and control of emissions through innovation or
technology; and
v. reputation: positive stakeholder relations as a result of a proactive stance on managing risks.
