ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 216/284AR 44. When disclosing the resources allocated to the management of material impacts, the undertaking may disclose
which internal functions are involved in managing the impacts and what types of action they take to address
negative and advance positive impacts.
Metrics and targets
Disclosure Requirement S2-5 – Targets related to managing material negative impacts, advancing positive impacts, and
managing material risks and opportunities
AR 45. When disclosing information about targets in accordance with paragraph 39, the undertaking may disclose:
(a) the intended outcomes to be achieved in the lives of value chain workers, being as specific as possible;
(b) the stability of the targets over time in terms of definitions and methodologies to enable comparability over
time;
(c) the standards or commitments on which the targets are based (for instance codes of conduct, sourcing policies, global frameworks or industry codes).
AR 46. Targets related to material risks and opportunities may be the same as or distinct from targets related to material
impacts. For example, a target to reach living wages for supply chain workers could both reduce impacts on those
workers and reduce associated risks in terms of the quality and reliability of supply.
AR 47. The undertaking may also distinguish between short-, medium- and long-term targets covering the same policy
commitment. For example, the undertaking may have a long-term target to achieve an 80% reduction in health and safety incidents affecting the workers of a given supplier by 2030 and a near-term target to reduce their
overtime hours of delivery drivers by x% while maintaining their income by 2024.
AR 48. When modifying or replacing a target in the reporting period, the undertaking may explain the change by cross-
referencing it to significant changes in the business model or to broader changes in the accepted standard or
legislation from which the target is derived to provide contextual information, as per ESRS 2 BP-2 Disclosures in
relation to specific circumstances.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
