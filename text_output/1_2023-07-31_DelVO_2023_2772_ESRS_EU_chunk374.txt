ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 161/284(b) the prioritisation of the avoidance or minimisation waste (Re-use, Repair, Refurbish, Remanufacture and
Repurpose) over waste treatment (Recycling). The concepts of eco-design (86), waste as a resource or post-
consumer waste (at the end of a consumer -product lifecycle), should also be taken into consideration.
AR 10. When defining its policies, the undertaking may consider the Paper on “Categorisation system for the circular economy”, which describes circular design and production models, circular use models, circular value recovery
models and circular support along the principles of the nine circular economy “R” strategies or principles: refuse,
rethink, reduce, re-use, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, repurpose and recycle.
Disclosure Requirement E5-2 – Actions and resources in relation to resource use and circular economy
AR 11. When providing information under paragraph 17 and considering that resources are shared and that circular
economy strategies may require collective actions, the undertaking may specify the actions taken to engage with
its upstream and downstream value chain and/or its local network on the development of collaborations or
initiatives increasing the circularity of products and materials.
AR 12. In particular, the undertaking may specify the following:
(a) how it contributes to circular economy, including for instance smart waste collection systems;
(b) the other stakeholders involved in the collective actions: competitors, suppliers, retailers, customers, other
business partners, local communities and authorities, government agencies;
(c) a description of the organisation of the collaboration or initiative, including the specific contribution of the
undertaking and the roles of the different stakeholders in the project.
AR 13. The actions may cover the undertaking’s own operations and/or its upstream and downstream value chain.
Metrics and targets
Disclosure Requirement E5-3 - Targets related to resource use and circular economy
AR 14. If the undertaking refers to ecological thresholds to set targets, it may refer to the guidance provided by the
Science-Based Targets Initiative for Nature (SBTN) in its interim guidance (Initial Guidance for Business, September
2020) or any other guidance with a scientifically acknowledged methodology that allows to set science-based
targets by identifying ecological thresholds and, if applicable, organisation-specific allocations. Ecological
thresholds can be local, national and/or global.
AR 15. When providing information on targets, the undertaking shall prioritise targets in absolute value.
