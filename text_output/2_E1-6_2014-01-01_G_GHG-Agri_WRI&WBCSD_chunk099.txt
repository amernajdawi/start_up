Accounting (GHG
accounting) Quantification and organization of information about GHG fluxes  
based on common procedures, and correct attribution of the same to
specific companies.
Agistment An arrangement between a stoc k owner and the owner of a short-term
supplier of feed to use that feed.
Agriculture The cultivation of animals, plants, fungi, and other life forms for food,
fiber, biofuel, drugs and other pr oducts used to sustain and enhance
human life
Agroforestry Integrated agricultural practi ces that exploit the interactive benefits
from combining trees and shrubs w ith crops and/or livestock.
Allocation The process of partitioning GHG flux  data from a farming system to 
the different product streams from that system
Amortization The allocation of CO 2 fluxes from changes in carbon stocks  over a 
period of time.
Base period A historic period against which a companyâ€™s GHG fluxes  are tracked 
over time.
Biogenic CO 2  
emissions CO 2 emissions from biological sources or materials derived from
biological matter.
By-product A by-product is an incidental out put from an agricultural process with
a minor market value, rather than the primary product being produced
or a co-product .  
Carbon pools Natural stores of carbon in bi omass, dead organic matter, soils, or
harvested products. Carbon pools both take-up and release CO 2.
Carbon stocks  The total amount of carbon stored on a plot of land at any given time 
in one or more carbon pools .
Carbon sequestration The net carbon accumulation (i.e., CO 2 fixation  minus CO 2 emissions) 
in carbon pools .
CO 2-equivalent (CO 2e) The universal unit for comparing emissions of different GHGs,
expressed in terms of the global warming potential  (GWP) of one unit 
of CO 2.  
CO 2 fixation The addition of carbon to carbon pools  through photosynthesis.   
Conservation area Land where agricultural production has been limited or halted so as to
provide environmental benefits, such as maintaining or improving
water quality or wildlife habitat.
Co-operative A business that is owned and controlled by the people (members) who
use its services and whose benefits are shared by the members on the
basis of use.
Co-product A co-product is an output of an agricultural system with a significant
market value in another system.  
Corporate GHG
emissions inventory A quantified list of the GHG fluxes  from across the entire operations of 
the reporting company. Such inventories include the emissions of all seven Kyoto GHGs  (CO
2, CH 4, N 2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF 6, and NF 3).
