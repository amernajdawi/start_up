ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 95/164(ii) can be concluded to be mineralised based on a specific Test No 308: Aerobic and Anaerobic Transformation in
Aquatic Sediment Systems (OECD 308) (23)of OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals (24)compared to
persistence criteria as defined in the EMA ERA guideline.
1.1.2. The medicinal product qualifies as an appropriate substitute to another medicinal product, within the same
therapeutic area or the substance class, that is available in the market or was available during last 5 years and that does not
comply with the requirements described in point 1.1.1.
Compliance with this requirement is demonstrated through a publicly available analysis verified by an independent third
party.
1.2. The manufacturer proves that there are no ingredients to produce an alternative medicinal product that qualifies as an
appropriate substitute, within the same therapeutic area or the substance class, that comply with the requirements
described in point 1.1.1. The activity complies with all the requirements specified in points 1.2.1 to 1.2.6.
1.2.1. The manufacturer performs an analysis that there is no appropriate substitute to the produced medicinal product,
publishes the core results of that analysis and demonstrates that they started initiatives to develop that alternative.1.2.2. In line with the EMA ERA guidelines, the PEC/PNEC ratio for the medicinal product obtained in the Environmental
Risk Assessment is below 1.
1.2.3. Packaging and distribution systems allow adjusting the sold amount to the required amount by the treatment/s,
taking into account the applicable national legislation.
1.2.4. Public information, such as leaflets or websites, updated according to the state of the art, is provided about dose and
dosing method to minimise the excess of dosed API.1.2.5. Packaging and distribution systems allow using the most efficient dosing system available according to the state of
the art and considering the kind of administration, such as by healthcare professionals or domestic. The manufacturer
publishes the main results of that analysis.
1.2.6. The manufacturer contributes to mitigating the environmental impact of incorrect waste disposal of unused
medicinal product, including by providing relevant information to the downstream users on appropriate disposal of
unused medicinal product.
1.3. The manufacturing process does not involve the use of substances, whether on their own or in mixtures, that meet the
criteria set out in Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 except where it is assessed and documented by the operator
that no other suitable alternative substances or technologies are available on the market, and that they are used under
controlled conditions (
25).
2.The activity complies with the following requirements regarding the emission of pollutants:
(23)Higher-tier studies (OECD 308) result with so-called half-lives indicating the time after which 50 % biodegradation of the API is
achieved. Half-lives acceptable to demonstrate sufficiently quick biodegradation, i.e. non-persistence, according to the Regulation (EC)
No 1907/2006, Annex XIII, which is also referenced in the EMA ERA guideline, apply.

(25)The Commission will review the exceptions from the prohibition from manufacturing, placing on the market or use of the substances referred to in points (f) and (g) once it will have published horizontal principles on essential use of chemicals.OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
