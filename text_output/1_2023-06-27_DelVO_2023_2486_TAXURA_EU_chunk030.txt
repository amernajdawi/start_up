ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 19/164The activity does not include small-scale nature-based solutions to reduce flood and drought, including green and blue
solutions applied in an urban setting, such as green roofs, swales, permeable surfaces and infiltration basins for urban
storm water management purposes or Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (see Section 2.3 of this Annex).
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code F42.91 in accordance with the statistical
classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.
Technical screening criteria
Substantial contribution to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources
1.The activity is a quantifiable and time bound measure to achieve the objectives for flood risk reduction in accordance
with a flood risk management plan coordinated at river basin scale and developed under Directive 2007/60/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council (14). In relation to drought risk reduction, the activity is a quantifiable and time
bound measure to achieve the objectives of Directive 2000/60/EC in accordance with a river basin management plan, or a drought management plan which is part of a river basin management plan.
For activities in third countries, the activity is identified as a flood risk reduction or a drought risk reduction measure either
in a water use and protection management plan at river basin scale or in an integrated coastal zone management plan along
a coast. Those plans pursue the objectives for the management of flood and drought risks to reduce adverse consequences,
where applicable for human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activity.
2.Environmental degradation risks related to preserving water quality and avoiding water stress and preventing
deterioration of the status of the affected water bodies are identified and addressed to achieve good water status and good
ecological potential as defined in Article 2, points (22) and (23), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in accordance with
Directive 2000/60/EC, and in line with a river basin management plan, developed thereunder for the potentially affected
water body or bodies, in consultation with relevant stakeholders.
Environmental degradation risks related to preserving marine environment are identified and addressed with the aim of
achieving or maintaining good environmental status as defined in point 5 of Article 3 of Directive 2008/56/EC.
3.The activity includes nature restoration or conservation actions that demonstrate specific ecosystem co-benefits, which
contribute to achieving good water status or potential in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC, good environmental
status in accordance with Directive 2008/56/EC, and the nature restoration and conservation targets specified in the
Communication from the Commission of 20 May 2020 on ‘EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030’ (
15). The activity contains
clear and binding targets on nature restoration or conservation over a clearly defined timeframe and describes measures to achieve those targets. Local stakeholders are involved from the outset in the planning and design phase. The activity is based
on the principles outlined by the IUCN Global Standard for nature-based solutions.
For activities in third countries, the activity takes into account National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans for the
setting of nature conservation and restoration targets and for the description of the measures to achieve these targets.
4.A monitoring programme is in place to evaluate the effectiveness of a nature-based solution scheme in improving the
status of the affected water body, achieving the conservation and restoration targets and in adapting to changing climate
conditions. The programme is reviewed following the periodic approach of the river basin management plans (including
drought management plans, where relevant) and the flood risk management plans.
