CHAPTER 13 Reporting
guidance13.3.5 Optional reporting
In addition to required elements, a company should
consider reporting on elements that meet the needs
of its potential audience, its specific business goals, or
the requirements of product rules and sector guideline
developed in conformance with the Product Standard .
These elements may be added to the public report or
made available upon request and may include:
•Business goals met by performing a GHG inventory
•Additional background information on inventory
results and how they are calculated
•Additional disclaimers around proper use of results
SKU, NAICS code, UNSPSC code or other unique
product/service identifier
•Additional details around why a particular unit of
analysis was chosen
•The country(ies) where the raw material acquisition,
production, and distribution stages occur
•Information on data collected from suppliers,
including:
•Percent engagement from supplier surveys
•Data collection techniques and sources
•Quantitative uncertainty assessments
•Data for other GHGs that may be relevant to the
studied product
•Inventory results using a 20 or 500 year GWP factor
or other impact assessment metrics such as global
temperate potential (GTP)
•If the functional unit and subsequent inventory
results are applicable to multiple product varieties
(e.g., different flavors or colors), information on those
varieties
•Indirect land-use change impacts reported separately
from the inventory results
 •Additional disaggregation of GHG impacts.  
Examples include:
•CO2e emissions reported as a fraction of all GHG
components (i.e., grams of CO2, N2O, CH4, etc.)
• For specific attributable processes or material,
energy and service inputs, such as product
packaging
•The sum of transportation occurring throughout
the life cycle •Weighting factors for delayed emissions
• Information on offsets that have been purchased
or developed outside the inventory boundary and
reported separately from the inventory results. This
information should:
•Disaggregate offsets by emissions reductions and/
or removals
•Specify the types of offset project/s
•Specify geographical and organizational origin
•Specify how offsets have been quantified
 •Specify how double counting of offsets has  
been avoided
 •Specify whether they have been certified  
or recognized by an external GHG program  
(e.g., the Clean Development Mechanism) and
•Specify whether and to what extent purchased
offsets were used to meet reduction targets  
(if established)
•Information on any reductions sold as offsets from
sources within the inventory boundary that are owned
or controlled by the reporting company
•Avoided emissions and/or emissions caused by sources
outside the inventory boundary reported separately
from the inventory results
•Other emissions or removals calculated by
consequential modeling reported separately from  
the inventory results
