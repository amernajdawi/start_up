also appropriate for the AnvilRecycled® t-shirt. Anvil
performed the recycled content method by including
the transport, cleaning, and production of the yarn
made from recycled textile clippings as the attributable
processes for the acquisition and preprocessing of the
yarn. They also assumed no attributable processes for the
end-of-life processing of the sold clipping from their cut
and sew operations because they are used as a recycled
input into other product life cycles. The use of the
recycled content method reduced the GHG inventory of
the AnvilRecycled® t-shirt
significantly compared to
the inventory conducted
assuming a virgin yarn
emission factor. The
additional specificity
provided in this standard
gave Anvil confidence
that they were using  
an established and
accepted recycling
allocation method. Anvil Knitwear
the recycled content
method reduced the
GHG inventory of

compared to the
