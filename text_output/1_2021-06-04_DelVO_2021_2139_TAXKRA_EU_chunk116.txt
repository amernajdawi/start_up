An economic activity in this category is an enabling activity in accordance with Article 10(1), point (i) of
Regulation (EU) 2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The activity complies with one of the following criteria:
1. The transmission and distribution infrastructure or equipment is in an electricity system that complies with
at least one of the following criteria:
(a) the system is the interconnected European system, i.e. the interconnected control areas of Member States,
Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and its subordinated systems;
(b) more than 67 % of newly enabled generation capacity in the system is below the generation threshold value
of 100 g CO  2 e/kWh measured on a life cycle basis in accordance with electricity generation criteria, over a 
rolling five-year period;
(c) the average system grid emissions factor, calculated as the total annual emissions from power generation
connected to the system, divided by the total annual net electricity production in that system, is below the
threshold value of 100 g CO  2 e/kWh measured on a life cycle basis in accordance with electricity generation 
criteria, over a rolling five-year period;
Infrastructure dedicated to creating a direct connection or expanding an existing direct connection between a
substation or network and a power production plant that is more greenhouse gas intensive than
100 g CO  2 e/kWh measured on a life cycle basis is not compliant. 
Installation of metering infrastructure that does not meet the requirements of smart metering systems of
Article 20 of Directive (EU) 2019/944 is not compliant.
2. The activity is one of the following:
(a) construction and operation of direct connection, or expansion of existing direct connection, of low carbon
electricity generation below the threshold of 100 g CO  2 e/kWh measured on a life cycle basis to a substation 
or network;
(b) construction and operation of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and supporting electric infrastructure for
the electrification of transport, subject to compliance with the technical screening criteria under the transport
Section of this Annex;
(c) installation of transmission and distribution transformers that comply with the Tier 2 (1 July 2021)
requirements set out in Annex I to the Commission Regulation (EU) No 548/2014 (  178  ) and, for medium 
power transformers with highest voltage for equipment not exceeding 36 kV, with AAA0 level requirements
on no-load losses set out in standard EN 50588-1 (  179  ). 
(d) construction/installation and operation of equipment and infrastructure where the main objective is an
increase of the generation or use of renewable electricity generation;
(e) installation of equipment to increase the controllability and observability of the electricity system and to
enable the development and integration of renewable energy sources, including:
(i) sensors and measurement tools (including meteorological sensors for forecasting renewable production);
(ii) communication and control (including advanced software and control rooms, automation of substations
or feeders, and voltage control capabilities to adapt to more decentralised renewable infeed).
