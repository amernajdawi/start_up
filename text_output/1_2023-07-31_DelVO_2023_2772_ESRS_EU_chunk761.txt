ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 282/284A value chain encompasses the activities, resources and relationships the
undertaking uses and relies on to create its products or services from
conception to delivery, consumption and end-of- life. Relevant activities,
resources and relationships include:
i. those in the undertaking’s own operations, such as human resources;
ii. those along its supply, marketing and distribution channels, such as materials and service sourcing and product and service sale and
delivery; and
iii. the financing, geographical, geopolitical and regulatory environments in which the undertaking operates.
Value chain includes actors upstream and downstream from the
undertaking. Actors upstream from the undertaking (e.g., suppliers)
provide products or services that are used in the development of the undertaking’s products or services. Entities downstream from the
undertaking (e.g., distributors, customers) receive products or services
from the undertaking.
ESRS use the term “value chain” in the singular, although it is recognised that
undertakings may have multiple value chains.
Value chain worker An individual performing work in the value chain of the undertaking,
regardless of the existence or nature of any contractual relationship with
the undertaking. In the ESRS, the scope of workers in the value chain
include all workers in the undertaking’s upstream and downstream value
chain who are or can be materially impacted by the undertaking. This
includes impacts that are connected to the undertaking’s own operations,
and value chain, including through its products or services, as well as
through its business relationships. This includes all workers who are not
in the scope of ‘Own Workforce ’ (‘Own Workforce ’ includes people who
are in an employment relationship with the undertaking (‘employees ’) and
non-employees who are either individual contractors supplying labour to
the undertaking (‘self-employed people’) or people provided by undertakings primarily engaged in employment activities. (NACE Code N78)
