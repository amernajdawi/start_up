Climate-related scenario analysis
AR 13. When disclosing the information required under paragraphs 19, 20, 21, AR 10 and AR 11, the undertaking shall
explain how it has used climate-related scenario analysis that is commensurate to its circumstances to inform the
identification and assessment of physical and transition risks and opportunities over the short-, medium- and
long-term, including:
(a) which scenarios were used, their sources and alignment with state-of-the-art science;
(b) narratives, time horizons, and endpoints used with a discussion of why it believes the range of scenarios used covers its plausible risks and uncertainties;
(c) the key forces and drivers taken into consideration in each scenario and why these are relevant to the
undertaking, for example, policy assumptions, macroeconomic trends, energy usage and mix, and technology
assumptions; and
(d) key inputs and constraints of the scenarios, including their level of detail (e.g., whether the analysis of physical
climate-related risks is based on geospatial coordinates specific to the undertaking’s locations or national- or
regional-level broad data).
AR 14. When conducting scenario analysis, the undertaking may consider the following guidance: TCFD Technical
Supplement on “The Use of Scenario Analysis in Disclosure of Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities” (2017);
TCFD “Guidance on Scenario Analysis for Non-Financial Companies” (2020); ISO 14091:2021 “Adaptation to
climate change — Guidelines on vulnerability, impacts and risk assessment”; any other recognised industry
standards such as NGFS (Network for Greening the Financial System); and EU, national, regional and local
regulations.
AR 15. The undertaking shall briefly explain how the climate scenarios used are compatible with the critical climate-
related assumptions made in the financial statements.
Disclosure Requirement E1-2 – Policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation
AR 16. Policies related to either climate change mitigation or climate adaptation may be disclosed separately as their
objectives, people involved, actions and resources needed to implement them are different.
AR 17. Policies related to climate change mitigation address the management of the undertaking’s GHG emissions, GHG
removals and transition risks over different time horizons, in its own operations and/or in the upstream and
downstream value chain. The requirement under paragraph 14 may relate to stand-alone climate change
mitigation policies as well as relevant policies on other matters that indirectly support climate change mitigation
including training policies, procurement or supply chain policies, investment policies or product development
policies.
AR 18. Policies related to climate change adaptation address the management of the undertaking’s physical climate risks
and of its transition risks related to climate change adaptation. The requirement under paragraphs 22 and 25
may relate to stand-alone climate change adaptation policies as well as relevant policies on other matters that
indirectly support climate change adaptation including training policies, and emergency or health and safety
policies.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
