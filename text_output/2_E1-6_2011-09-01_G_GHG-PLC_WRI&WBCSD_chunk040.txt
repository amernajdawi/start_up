[50]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard
guidance8.3.2 Identifying data needs
The attributable processes identified during boundary
setting and in the process map provide a basis for the list
of data that needs to be collected. The data management
plan can also be used to organize attributable processes if
it is not possible to include them all in a process map.
8.3.3 Data screening
Screening processes based on their estimated contribution
to the total life cycle helps companies focus their data
collection efforts. While such screening is not required,
it may deliver surprising findings and help companies
prioritize data collection resources more effectively.
The most effective way to perform screening is to
estimate the emissions and removals of processes
and process inputs using secondary data and rank the
estimates in order of their contribution to the product’s
life cycle. Companies can then use this list to prioritize
the collection of primary or quality secondary data on the
processes and process inputs that have the largest impact
on the inventory results. If companies choose not to
estimate emissions and removals during screening, they should at a minimum identify and focus data collection on
processes that are known to consume or produce large
amounts of GHG-intensive energy or material inputs.
During the screening process it is also helpful to assess
the estimated uncertainty. Processes that contribute
significantly to the total life cycle emissions based on data
with high levels of uncertainty should be priority areas for
data collection.
Processes may be relevant for non-emissions-
related reasons for some companies. Under such
circumstances, companies may want to use the
following criteria, in addition to the ones above, to
establish data collection priorities:
•Processes that are significant by spend relative to
other processes in the product’s life cycle
•Processes with potential emissions reductions that
could be undertaken or influenced by the company
•Processes that are controlled by suppliers with
strategic importance to the company’s core business
•Processes that meet additional criteria developed by
the company or industry sector
