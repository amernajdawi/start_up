and suppliers. For the latter, the first step is to set up a
strategy for supplier and customer engagement (See
www.ghgprotocol.org  for further guidance). Companies 
should work with partners along the productâ€™s life cycle
to identify emissions reduction opportunities. This may
include working with a supplier to help them manage
and reduce their corporate (scope 1, 2, and 3) emissions.
Other opportunities can include working with suppliers
to come up with substitute materials that are less GHG
intensive during production and/or reduce GHG impacts
further upstream (e.g., a lighter car panel that reduces
fuel use in the product use stage).
To account for reductions in emissions, companies
are referred to the data collection requirements of
this standard (chapter 8). Any reductions should be
assessed using collected direct measurement data,
activity data, or emission factors that abide by the
attributional approach of the standard (i.e., historical,
fact-based, and measurable) and have occurred prior
to the updated inventory.
One limitation of a GHG product inventory is that it
focuses on a single environmental impact. Before
making a decision to reduce GHG emissions by
making changes in the product life cycle, companies
should consider whether any environmental trade-
offs could occur as a result of that change - for
example, switching from a GHG intensive processing
step to one that uses more water resources. Box [14.1]  Trade-offs between environmental impacts
