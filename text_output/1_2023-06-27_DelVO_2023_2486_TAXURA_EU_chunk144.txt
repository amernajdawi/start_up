ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 104/1642.3. Remediation of legally non-conforming landfills and abandoned or illegal waste dumps
Description of the activity
Remediation of legally non-conforming landfills (57)and of abandoned or illegal waste dumps (58)that have been closed and
are not taking in further waste other than possibly inert or biostabilised waste to be used as landfill cover material (as far as
allowed in the environmental permit for the remediation project).
The activity may include any of the following remediation strategies and sub-activities typically implemented as part of
projects aimed at removing, controlling, containing or diminishing polluting emissions (59)from non-conforming landfills
and abandoned or illegal dumpsites:
(a) remediation through environmental isolation of non-conforming or illegal landfills or dumpsites at the present site,
including:
(i) physical isolation, concentration, structural stabilisation and protection of the non-conforming or illegal landfill or
dumpsite, including application of hydraulic barriers, sealing, drainage and cover layers;
(ii) installation, operation and maintenance of drainage and separate collection and treatment systems for leachates and run-off water prior to discharge;
(iii) installation, operation and maintenance of landfill gas collection, abatement and control systems, including wells, piping and flaring systems;
(iv) application of top soil and vegetation cover for renaturation purposes;
(b) remediation through excavation and removal of non-conforming or illegal landfills or dumpsites with subsequent
treatment, recovery or disposal of excavated waste, including:
(i) selective excavation of the waste deposited on the site, loading and transport to existing permitted treatment,
recovery or disposal facilities with separate management of non-hazardous and hazardous waste;
(ii) sorting and recovery of materials and fuels from excavated non-hazardous waste, including the installation, operation and maintenance of dedicated facilities and equipment for the duration of the remediation project;
(c) remediation through decontamination of soils, surface and groundwater at the place of pollution, including the following:
(i) selective excavation, loading, transport, temporary storage, backfilling of soil, with separate management of non-
contaminated and contaminated soils;
(ii) treatment of contaminated soil or water, either in situ or ex situ, using in particular physical, chemical or biological methods, including the installation, operation and maintenance of dedicated facilities for the duration of the
remediation project;
(iii) application of hydraulic barriers, active and passive barriers intended to limit/prevent migration of pollutants.
(57)The term ‘landfill’ is defined in Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste (OJ L 182, 16.7.1999, p. 1) as
a ‘waste disposal site for the deposit of the waste onto or into land (i.e. underground)’ including both non-hazardous and hazardous
waste.
A ‘legally non-conforming’ landfill is a landfill that does not comply with the operational and technical requirements defined in
relevant EU or national legislation.
(58)A ‘waste dump’ is a site used for the disposal of waste that is not equipped with pollution abatement systems.
(59)‘Emission’ means the release in the environment, as a result of human activities, of substances, preparations, organisms or micro-
organisms (as set out in Article 2 of Directive 2004/35/CE of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on
environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage (OJ L 143, 30.4.2004, p. 56)).OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
