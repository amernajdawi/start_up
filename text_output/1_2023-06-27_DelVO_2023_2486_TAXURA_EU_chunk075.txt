ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 53/1644.The use of primary raw material in the construction of the building is minimised through the use of secondary raw
materials (82). The operator of the activity ensures that the three heaviest material categories used to construct the building,
measured by mass in kilogrammes, comply with the following maximum total amounts of primary raw material used:
(a) for the combined total of concrete (83), natural or agglomerated stone, a maximum of 70 % of the material comes from
primary raw material;
(b) for the combined total of brick, tile, ceramic, a maximum of 70 % of the material comes from primary raw material;
(c) for bio-based materials (84), a maximum of 80 % of the total material comes from primary raw material;
(d) for the combined total of glass, mineral insulation, a maximum of 70 % of the total material comes from primary raw material;
(e) for non-biobased plastic, a maximum of 50 % of the total material comes from primary raw material;
(f) for metals, a maximum of 30 % of the total material comes from primary raw material;
(g) for gypsum, a maximum of 65 % of the material comes from primary raw material.
The thresholds are calculated by subtracting the secondary raw material from the total amount of each material category
used in the works measured by mass in kilogrammes. Where the information on the recycled content of a construction
product is not available, it is to be counted as comprising 100 % primary raw material. In order to respect the Waste
Hierarchy and thereby favour re-use over recycling, re-used construction products, including those containing non-waste
materials reprocessed on site, are to be counted as comprising zero primary raw material. Compliance with this criterion is
demonstrated by reporting in accordance with the Level(s) indicator 2.1 (
85).
5.The operator of the activity uses electronic tools to describe the characteristics of the building as built, including the
materials and components used, for the purpose of future maintenance, recovery, and reuse, for example using EN ISO 22057:2022 to provide Environmental Product Declarations (
86). The information is stored in a digital format and is made
available to investors and clients on demand. In addition, the operator ensures the long-term preservation of this
information beyond the useful life of the building by using the information managing systems provided by national tools,
such as cadastre or public register.
(82)For the purposes of the Delegated Act, ‘secondary raw materials’ means materials that have been prepared for re-use or recycled in
accordance with Article 3 of the Waste Framework Directive and have ceased to be waste under Article 6 of that Directive.
(83)This concerns the material concrete, including its constituent ingredients (for example, aggregates). Any steel reinforcement is excluded since this is a different material which can be accounted for under metals.
(84)Bio-based materials are made using biological resources (animals, plants, micro-organisms and derived biomass, including organic waste), as defined in COM(2018) 673. They include conventional bio-based materials made traditionally from biomass (such as
wood, cork, natural rubber, paper, textiles, wooden construction materials) and more recently developed materials such as bio-based
chemicals or bio-based plastics.
