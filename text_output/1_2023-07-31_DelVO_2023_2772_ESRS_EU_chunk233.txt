ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 233/284Objective
1. The objective of this Standard is to specify disclosure requirements which will enable users of the sustainability
statement to understand material impacts on consumers and end-users connected with the undertaking’s own
operations and value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships,
and its related material risks and opportunities, including:
(a) how the undertaking affects the consumers and/or end-users of its products and/or services (referred to in this
Standard as “consumers and end-users”), in terms of material positive and negative actual or potential impacts;
(b) any actions taken, and the result of such actions, to prevent, mitigate or remediate actual or potential negative
impacts, and to address risks and opportunities;
(c) the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities related to its impacts and
dependencies on consumers and end-users, and how the undertaking manages such risks and opportunities; and
(d) the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and
opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on consumers and/or end-users.
2. In order to meet the objective, this Standard requires an explanation of the general approach the undertaking takes to
identify and manage any material actual and potential impacts on the consumers and/or end-users related to its
products and/or services in relation to:
(a) information-related impacts on consumers and/or end-users (for example, privacy, freedom of expression and
access to (quality) information;
(b) personal safety of consumers and/or end-users (for example, health and safety, security of a person and
protection of children);
(c) social inclusion of consumers and/or end-users (for example, non-discrimination, access to products and services
and responsible marketing practices).
3. This Standard also requires an explanation of how such impacts, as well as the undertaking’s dependencies on
consumers and/or end-users, can create material risks or opportunities for the undertaking. For example, negative
impacts on the reputation of the undertaking’s products and/or services can be detrimental to its business
performance, while trust in products and/or services can bring business benefits, such as increased sales or widening
of the future consumer base.
4. The unlawful use or misuse of the undertaking’s products and services by consumers and end-users fall outside the
scope of this standard.
