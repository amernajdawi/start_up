stated over several years. An example would be “from
2001 through 2012, emissions will be reduced by onepercent every year, compared to the previous year.”When structural or methodological changes occur,recalculati ons only need to be made to the previous
year.
7As a result, like-with-like comparisons of
emissions in the “target starting year” (2001 in theexample) and “target completion year” (2012)cannot be made because emissions are not recalcu-lated for all years back to the target starting year.
The definition of what triggers a base-year emissions
recalculation is the same as under the fixed base yearapproach. The difference lies in how far back emissionsare recalculated. Table 5 compares targets using therolling and fixed base year approaches while Figure 14illustrates one of the key differences.
RECALCULATIONS UNDER INTENSITY TARGETS
While the standard in chapter 5 applies to absoluteinventory emissions of companies using intensitytargets, recalculations for structural changes for thepurposes of the target are not usually needed unless thestructural change results in a significant change in theGHG intensity. However, if recalculations for structuralchanges are made for the purposes of the target, theyshould be made for both the absolute emissions and thebusiness metric. If the target business metric becomesirrelevant through a structural change, a reformulationof the target might be needed (e.g., when a companyrefocuses on a different industry but had used anindustry-specific business metric before).  
5.  Define the target completion date
The target completion date determines whether thetarget is relatively short- or long-term. Long-termtargets (e.g., with a completion year ten years from thetime the target is set) facilitate long-term planning forlarge capital investments with GHG benefits. However,they might encourage later phase-outs of less efficientequipment. Generally, long-term targets depend onuncertain future developments, which can have opportu-nities as well as risks, which is illustrated in Figure 13.A five-year target period may be more practical fororganizations with shorter planning cycles.6. Define the length of the commitment period
The target commitment period is the period of timeduring which emissions performance is actually measuredagainst the target. It ends with the target completiondate. Many companies use single-year commitmentperiods, whereas the Kyoto Protocol, for example, speci-fies a multi-year “first commitment period” of five years(2008 –2012). The length of the target commitmentperiod is an important factor in determining a company’slevel of commitment. Generally, the longer the targetcommitment period, the longer the period during whichemissions performance counts towards the target.

EXAMPLE OF A SINGLE YEAR COMMITMENT PERIOD.
Company Beta has a target of reducing emissions by
10 percent compared to its target base year 2000, bythe commitment year 2010. For Beta to meet its target,it is sufficient for its emissions to be, in the year 2010,no more than 90 percent of year 2000 emissions.

EXAMPLE OF A MULTI-YEAR COMMITMENT PERIOD.
Company Gamma has a target of reducing emissions
by 10 percent, compared to its target base year 2000,by the commitment period 2008–2012. For Gammato meet its target, its sum total emissions from2008–2012 must not exceed 90 percent of year2000 emissions times five (number of years in theGUIDANCESetting a GHG Target
