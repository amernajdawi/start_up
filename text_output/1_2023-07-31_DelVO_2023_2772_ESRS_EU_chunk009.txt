ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 8/28423. Some, but not all, stakeholders may belong to both groups referred to in paragraph 22.
24. Engagement with affected stakeholders is central to the undertaking’s on-going due diligence process (see chapter 4
Due diligence) and sustainability materiality assessment. This includes its processes to identify and assess actual and
potential negative impacts, which then inform the assessment process to identify the material impacts for the
purposes of sustainability reporting (see section 3.4 of this Standard).
3.2 Material matters and materiality of information
25. Performing a materiality assessment (see sections 3.4 Impact materiality and 3.5 Financial materiality) is necessary for
the undertaking to identify the material impacts, risks and opportunities to be reported.
26. Materiality assessment is the starting point for sustainability reporting under ESRS. IRO-1 in section 4.1 of ESRS 2,
includes general disclosure requirements about the undertaking’s process to identify impacts, risks and opportunities
and assess their materiality. SBM-3 of ESRS 2 provides general disclosure requirements on the material impacts, risks
and opportunities resulting from the undertaking’s materiality assessment.
27. The Application Requirements in Appendix A of this Standard include a list of sustainability matters covered in
topical ESRS, categorised by topics, sub-topics and sub-sub-topics, to support the materiality assessment. Appendix
E Flowchart for determining disclosures to be included of this Standard provides an illustration of the materiality
assessment described in this section.
28. A sustainability matter is “material” when it meets the criteria defined for impact materiality (see section 3.4 of this
Standard) or financial materiality (see section 3.5 of this Standard), or both.
29. Irrespective of the outcome of its materiality assessment, the undertaking shall always disclose the information
required by: ESRS 2 General Disclosures (i.e. all the Disclosure Requirements and data points specified in ESRS 2) and
the Disclosure Requirements (including their datapoints) in topical ESRS related to the Disclosure Requirement
IRO-1 Description of the process to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities, as listed in ESRS 2
Appendix C Disclosure/Application Requirements in topical ESRS that are applicable jointly with ESRS 2 General Disclosures.
30. When the undertaking concludes that a sustainability matter is material as a result of its materiality assessment, on
which ESRS 2 IRO-1, IRO-2 and SBM-3 set disclosure requirements, it shall:
(a) disclose information according to the Disclosure Requirements (including Application Requirements) related to
that specific sustainability matter in the corresponding topical and sector-specific ESRS; and
(b) disclose additional entity-specific disclosures (see paragraph 11 and AR 1 to AR 5 of this Standard) when the material sustainability matter is not covered by an ESRS or is covered with insufficient granularity.
31. The applicable information prescribed within a Disclosure Requirement, including its datapoints, or an entity-specific
disclosure, shall be disclosed when the undertaking assesses, as part of its assessment of material information, that
the information is relevant from one or more of the following perspectives:
(a) the significance of the information in relation to the matter it purports to depict or explain; or
(b) the capacity of such information to meet the users’ decision-making needs, including the needs of primary users
of general-purpose financial reporting described in paragraph 48 and/or the needs of users whose principal
interest is in information about the undertaking’s impacts.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
