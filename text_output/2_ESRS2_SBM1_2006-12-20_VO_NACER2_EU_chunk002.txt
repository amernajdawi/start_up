common framework for setting up statistical business
registers with harmonised definitions, characteristics, scopeand updating procedures.
(11) The establishment of a revised statistical classification of

ally various references to NACE Rev. 1 as well as to amend anumber of relevant instruments. It is therefore necessary toamend the following instruments: Regulation (EEC)No 3037/90; Council Regulation (EEC) No 3924/91 of19 December 1991 on the establishment of a Communitysurvey of industrial production (

Regulation (EC) No 1552/2005 of the European Parliamentand of the Council of 7 September 2005 on statisticsrelating to vocational training in enterprises (

(12) A number of Community instruments need to be amended,
according to the specific procedures applicable to them,
before transition to NACE Rev. 2, namely: CouncilRegulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on theEuropean system of national and regional accounts in the

Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down theprocedures for the exercise of implementing powers
conferred on the Commission (

(14) In particular, power should be conferred on the Commis-
sion to amend or supplement NACE Rev. 2 in order to take
account of technological or economic developments or toalign it with other economic and social classifications. Sincethese measures are of general scope and designed to amendnon-essential elements of this Regulation or to supplementthis Regulation by the addition of new non-essentialelements, they should be adopted in accordance with theregulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for inArticle 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(15) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the creation
of common statistical standards that permit the production
of harmonised data, cannot be sufficiently achieved by theMember States and can therefore be better achieved atCommunity level, the Community may adopt measures,
in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in
Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle ofproportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulationdoes not go beyond what is necessary to achieve thatobjective.
