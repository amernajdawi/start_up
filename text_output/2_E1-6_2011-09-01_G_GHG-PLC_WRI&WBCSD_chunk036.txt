CHAPTER 07 Boundary Setting
guidanceinventory, particularly when a downstream customer
of an intermediate product wants to use the cradle-to-
gate data to calculate the cradle-to-grave inventory of
their final product. As stated previously, companies are
required to clearly disclose and justify in the inventory
report when a cradle-to-gate boundary is used. For
example, an appropriate justification could be lack of
knowledge of the final product’s use profile. The fact that
a cradle-to-gate, and not cradle-to-grave, inventory was
performed should also be made clear in the process map
and the description of life cycle stages.
A cradle-to-gate inventory performed in conformance
with this standard does not include the use and end-of-
life stages of the final product. This is to preserve the
continuous nature of the life cycle approach and avoid
cherry picking (e.g., omitting a GHG-intensive use stage
but including the end-of-life stage). In some cases, the
company producing the intermediate product may have
information on end-of-life processes that would improve
the downstream customer’s inventory, such as recycling
rates or time period. Companies may include additional
information about the end-of-life stage in the report of a
cradle-to-gate inventory, as long as it is clearly separated
from the inventory results (e.g., the total CO2 equivalents
[CO2e] per unit of analysis) and process map. Endnotes
1  This refers only to biomass burning, liming, and other practices 
used to prepare converted land. Biomass burning and fertilizer
application due to agricultural and forestry practices are also
included in the inventory as attributable processes, separate from
land-use change impacts.
2   Indirect land use does not refer to the direct land used to 
produce an attributable input into the studied product (e.g., the
land used to produce animal feed which is an attributable input
for the studied product beef).
3  Material inputs such as part replacement due to operation and 
maintenance may fall within the use or material acquisition stage.
Although the process occurs in the use stage, it may be easiest
during data collection to include all emissions associated with
that material input over the product’s life cycle during material
acquisition. For example, if the product requires two timing
belts during its service life, companies can either assume one
during material acquisition and one during use, or both during
material acquisition. Either is appropriate as long as this is made
transparent in the inventory report.
4 Companies may determine significance based on the process, life
cycle stage, or inventory level as long as this is done consistently
throughout the inventory.
5 Treating waste under anaerobic conditions means that the waste
degrades with limited oxygen. This typically occurs in landfills
where oxygen is unable to penetrate buried waste.
