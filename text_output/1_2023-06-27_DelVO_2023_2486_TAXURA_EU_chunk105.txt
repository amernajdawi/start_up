Technical screening criteria
Substantial contribution to the transition to a circular economy
1.The activity prepares for re-use products or components of products that have become waste so that they can be re-used
without any other pre-processing.
2.The activityâ€™s waste feedstock originates from separately collected and transported waste in source segregated or
commingled fractions (
169).
3.The activity has implemented acceptance, safety and inspection procedures that comply with the following criteria:
(a) a procedure is in place to check the suitability for preparing for re-use or recycling, and that the activity implements a
publicly available waste management plan, which ensures that discarded end-of-life products not suitable for
preparing for re-use (due to damage, degradation or hazardous substances) are sent for recycling or, only where reuse
and recycling is not viable, disposed of;
(b) the procedure which can be based on visual or manual external inspection against pre-determined criteria is suited to
the category of discarded end-of-life products, which are prepared for re-use;
(c) proper training is provided and ensures that the re-use operators are qualified for the preparing for re-use activities of the discarded end-of-life products at stake.
4.The activity uses the tools and equipment suited for the preparation for re-use of discarded end-of-life products.
5.The activity has a system to report recovery rate and, where applicable, targets for preparing for re-use or recycling set
out by Union or national legislation.
(169)In the Union, the activity is in line with Article 10(3) of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of
19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives (OJ L 312, 22.11.2008, p. 3), or sectoral Union legislation related to
