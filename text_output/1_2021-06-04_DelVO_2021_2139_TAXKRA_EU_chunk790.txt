(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  N/A  
6.6.  Freight transport services by road  
Description of the activity  
Purchase, financing, leasing, rental and operation of vehicles designated as category N1, N2 (  480  ) or N3 (  481  ) falling 
under the scope of EURO VI (  482  ), step E or its successor for freight transport services by road.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular H49.4.1,
H53.10, H53.20 and N77.12 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established
by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.
The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan,
such that:
(a) for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using
climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale;
(b) for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state-of-the-art
climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios (  483  ) consistent with the expected lifetime 
of the activity, including, at least, 10 to 30 year climate projections scenarios for major investments.
3. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and
take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line
with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports (  484  ), scientific peer-reviewed 
publications and open source (  485  ) or paying models.
