(b) by closing the gap by at least 20 % either between the current leakage level averaged over three years,
calculated using the Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI) rating method and an ILI of 1.5 (  207  ), or between the 
current leakage level averaged over three years, calculated using another appropriate method, and the
threshold value established in accordance with Article 4 of Directive (EU) 2020/2184. The current
leakage level averaged over three years is calculated across the extent of water supply (distribution)
network where the works are carried out, i.e. for the renewed water supply (distribution) network at
district metered area(s) (DMAs) or pressure managed area(s) (PMAs).  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  N/A  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
5.3.  Construction, extension and operation of waste water collection and treatment  
Description of the activity  
Construction, extension and operation of centralised waste water systems including collection (sewer network) and
treatment.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E37.00 and
F42.99 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. The net energy consumption of the waste water treatment plant equals to or is lower than:
(a) 35 kWh per population equivalent (p.e.) per annum for treatment plant capacity below 10 000 p.e.;
(b) 25 kWh per population equivalent (p.e.) per annum for treatment plant capacity between 10 000 and
100 000 p.e.;
(c) 20 kWh per population equivalent (p.e.) per annum for treatment plant capacity above 100 000 p.e.
Net energy consumption of the operation of the waste water treatment plant may take into account measures
decreasing energy consumption relating to source control (reduction of storm water or pollutant load inputs),
and, as appropriate, energy generation within the system (such as hydraulic, solar, thermal and wind energy).

( 207  ) The Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI) is calculated as current annual real losses (CARL)/unavoidable annual real losses (UAR L): The 
current annual real losses (CARL) represent the amount of water that is actually lost from the distribution network (i.e. not
delivered to final users). The unavoidable annual real losses (UARL) take into consideration that there will always be some lea kage
in a water distribution network. The UARL is calculated based on factors such as the length of the network, the number of servi ce
connections and the pressure at which the network is operating.EN  L 442/92 Official Journal of the European Union 9.12.2021
