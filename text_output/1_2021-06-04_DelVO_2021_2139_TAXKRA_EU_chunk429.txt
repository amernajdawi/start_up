The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code K65.12 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation
(EU) 2020/852 where it meets the technical screening criteria set out in this section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. Leadership in modelling and pricing of climate risks:  
1.1. The insurance activity uses state-of-the-art modelling techniques that:
(a) properly reflect climate change risks;
(b) do not only rely on historical trend;
(c) integrate forward-looking scenarios.
1.2. The insurer publicly discloses how the climate change risks are considered in the insurance activity.
1.3. With the exception of legal restrictions on contractual conditions and insurance premiums, the insurance
activity provides incentives for risk reduction by setting out the (pre)-conditions for the insurance coverage of risk
and by acting as a price signal of risk. For the purpose of this point, reduced premiums or deductibles, possibly
based on supportive information on existing/possible actions, to policyholders who protect an asset or activity
against natural catastrophes damages may be considered an incentive for risk reduction.
1.4. After a climate risk event, the insurer provides information on the conditions under which coverage under
the insurance activity could be renewed or maintained and in particular the benefits of building better in that
context.
2. Product design:  
2.1. Insurance products sold under the insurance activity offer risk-based rewards for preventive actions taken
by policyholders.
For the purpose of this point, where a policyholder has invested in adaptation measures, lower premiums may be
considered as a risk-based reward for preventive actions taken by policyholders.
