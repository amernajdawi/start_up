ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 13/164The economic activity includes abstraction of the water resource, necessary treatment to make the quality of water
compliant with the applicable legislation and distribution to the population and food business operators in piped systems.
The economic activity does not cover irrigation and abstraction of water resources for desalination of marine or brackish
water.
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E36.00 and F42.9, in
accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.
Technical screening criteria
Substantial contribution to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources
1.For the operation of an existing water supply system providing water supply in a sufficient and healthy quality to
consumers, and contributing to water resource efficiency, the activity complies with the following criteria:
(a) the water supply system complies with Directive (EU) 2020/2184, Commission Implementing Decision
(EU) 2022/679 (3), and delegated and implementing acts adopted under that Directive;
(b) the leakage level of the system is either calculated using the Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI) (4)rating method and the
threshold value equals to or is lower than 2,0, or is calculated using another appropriate method and the threshold value is established in accordance with Article 4 of Directive (EU) 2020/2184. That calculation is to be applied across
the extent of a specified part of a water supply (distribution) network, i.e. at water supply zone level, district metered
area(s) (DMAs) or pressure managed area(s) (PMAs);
(c) the water supply systems include metering at consumer level, where water is delivered to a contractual delivery point of the consumers’ own drinking water distribution system.
2.For the construction and operation of a new water supply system, or an extension of an existing water supply system
that provides water to new areas or improves that water supply to existing areas, the activity complies with the following
criteria:
(a) the water supply system complies with Directive (EU) 2020/2184, including the requirements set out in Article 13(8)
of that Directive, in Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/679, and in delegated and implementing acts adopted under
that Directive;
(b) the leakage level of the new or extension system is either calculated using the Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI) rating method and the threshold value equals to or is lower than 1,5 or is calculated using another appropriate method and
the threshold value is established in accordance with Article 4 of Directive (EU) 2020/2184. That calculation is to be
applied across the extent of the affected and specified part of a water supply (distribution) network where the works
are carried out, i.e. at water supply zone level, district metered area(s) (DMAs) or pressure managed area(s) (PMAs);
(c) the water supply system includes metering at consumer level, where water is delivered to a contractual delivery point of
the consumers’ own drinking water distribution system.
3.For renewal of existing water supply systems, the activity complies with the following criteria:
(3)Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/679 of 19 January 2022 establishing a watch list of substances and compounds of
concern for water intended for human consumption as provided for in Directive (EU) 2020/2184 of the European Parliament and of
the Council (OJ L 124, 27.4.2022, p. 41).
(4)The Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI) is calculated as current annual real losses (CARL)/unavoidable annual real losses (UARL). The
current annual real losses (CARL) represent the amount of water that is actually lost from the distribution network (i.e. not delivered
to final users). The unavoidable annual real losses (UARL) take into consideration that there will always be some leakage in a water
