[102]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standardrequirements
Boundary setting
 •	Life	cycle	stage	definitions	and 	
descriptions;
• A process map including attributable
processes in the inventory;
 • Non-attributable processes included  
in the inventory;
 • Excluded attributable processes  
and	justification	for	their	exclusion; 	
 •	Justification	of	a	cradle-to-gate 	
boundary, when applicable;
•The time period; and
• The method use to calculate land-use
change impacts, when applicable.
Allocation
 •	Disclosure	and	justification	of	the 	
methods used to avoid or perform
allocation due to co-products or
recycling; and
• When using the closed loop
approximation method, any displaced
emissions and removals separately  
from the end-of-life stage.
Data collection and quality
 •	For	significant	processes,	a	descriptive 	
statement on the data sources, data
quality,	and	any	efforts	taken	to	improve 	
data quality.
Uncertainty
• A qualitative statement on inventory
uncertainty and methodological choices.
Methodological choices include:
•Use and end-of-life profile;
• Allocation methods, including allocation
due to recycling;
• Source of global warming potential
(GWP) factors used;
•Calculation models.
Inventory results
 • The source and date of the GWP  
factors used;
• Total inventory results in units of CO2e
per unit of analysis, which includes all
emissions and removals included in  
the boundary from biogenic sources,  
non-biogenic sources, and land-use
change impacts;
• Percentage of total inventory results by
life cycle stage;
 •	Biogenic	and	non-biogenic	emissions	and 	
removals separately when applicable;
• Land use impacts separately when
applicable;
• Cradle-to-gate and gate-to-gate
inventory results separately (or a clear
statement	that	confidentiality	is	a 	
limitation to providing this information);
• The amount of carbon contained in the
product or its components that is not
released to the atmosphere during waste
treatment, when applicable; and
• For cradle-to-gate inventories, the
amount of carbon contained in the
intermediate product.
