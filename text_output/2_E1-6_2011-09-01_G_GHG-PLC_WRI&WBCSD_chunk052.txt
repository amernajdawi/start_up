guidanceStep 1:   Avoid allocation if possible
Step 2:   If allocation is necessary, determine if a physical relationship exists
Step 3:  If a physical relationship cannot be established or is not applicable,  
use economic allocation or other relationshipsFigure [9.2] Steps to select an allocation method4

is there an underlying physical relationship between  
the studied product, co-product(s)  
and their emissions contributions?
are the market values of the studied product and  
co-product(s)	free	of	significant	market	effects	on	their 	
valuation (e.g. brand value, constrained supply, etc.)?are there other relationships between  
the studied product and co-product(s)  
that can be established?can the common process
be divided  
and evaluated  
as separate processes?is it practical to combine
the studied product  
and co-product(s) into one
single functional unit?can the co-productâ€™s
emissions be modeled
using a similar process or
product, and do you have
direct knowledge  
about  the eventual use of 
the co-product(s)?
