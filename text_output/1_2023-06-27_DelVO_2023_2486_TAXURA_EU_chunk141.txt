ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 102/164(b) documented sampling procedure consistent with relevant standards, such as EN 14899:2005 (50);
(c) documented analysis of the relevant physico-chemical parameters for the treatment;
(d) a dedicated quarantine waste storage area, as well as written procedures to manage non-accepted waste.
The personnel dealing with the pre-acceptance and acceptance procedures is able, due to their profession or experience, to
deal with all necessary questions relevant for the treatment of the wastes in the waste treatment facility. The procedures are
intended to pre-accepting and accepting wastes at the waste treatment plant only if a suitable treatment route is available
and the disposal or recovery route for the output of the treatment is determined.
For ‘blending or mixing activities’ (as set out in Annex I, Section 5.1(c) of Directive 2010/75/EU), the operator is not using
dilution to lower the concentration of one or more hazardous substances present in the waste, with the aim for the
resulting waste mix to be declassified and become ‘non-hazardous waste’ and thus be subsequently treated in facilities non-
dedicated to the treatment of hazardous waste. Dilution is not used as a ‘substitute’ to the adequate treatment of the waste.
2.For the physico-chemical treatment of solid or pasty waste, any treatment for the purpose of treating waste prior to final
disposal, such as in hazardous waste landfills, is designed to fullfil the following requirements:
(a) limit at 6 % the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) maximum concentration in each single input waste to the landfill;
(b) limit at 1 000 mg/kg dry matter Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) content of the output waste after a leaching test with
L/S = 10 l/kg based on EU Standard EN 12457-2:2002 (51).
3.For the physico-chemical treatment of waste with calorific value, measures are taken in order to avoid dilution and
dispersion of hazardous substances, and to avoid any high loads released into the air due to inappropriate final treatment
of waste with calorific value. Any treatment installation prior to final thermal treatments (incineration or co-incineration)
is to be designed with the purpose of limiting the content of hazardous substances (and meet other related criteria) for
each single input waste treated at the physico-chemical treatment installation, so that the acceptance levels at the entrance
of the final thermal treatment installations are respected.
4.For the treatment of aqueous liquid waste, the biological treatability of the waste water resulting from the treatment of
the water-based liquid waste in a biological waste water treatment plant is judged based on the following criterion:
Dissolved Organic Carbon DOC elimination of > 70 % in 7 days (> 80 % when adapted inoculum is used) in accordance
with EN ISO 9888 (52)(Zahn Wellens), or other commonly accepted, equivalent industry standards and methodologies
used to assess bio-elimination and related performances.
5.For the treatment of waste containing Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP), all waste containing POP substances listed in
Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 are controlled and traced as hazardous waste in accordance with Article 17 of
Directive 2008/98/EC. Specific requirements of Articles 7(4), 17, 18 and 19 of Directive 2008/98/EC apply. In case of
transboundary movement, requirements of Chapter I of the Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament
and of the Council (53)apply.
