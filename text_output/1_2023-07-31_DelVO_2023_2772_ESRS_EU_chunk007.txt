ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 6/2849. Topical ESRS can include specific requirements that complement the general level Disclosure Requirements of ESRS
2. ESRS 2 Appendix C Disclosure/Application Requirements in topical ESRS that are applicable jointly with ESRS 2 General
Disclosures provides a list of the additional requirements in topical ESRS that the undertaking shall apply in
conjunction with the general level disclosure requirements of ESRS 2.
10. Sector-specific standards are applicable to all undertakings within a sector. They address impacts, risks and
opportunities that are likely to be material for all undertakings in a specific sector and that are not covered, or not
sufficiently covered, by topical standards. Sector-specific standards are multi-topical and cover the topics that are
most relevant to the sector in question. Sector-specific standards achieve a high degree of comparability.
11. In addition to the disclosure requirements laid down in the three categories of ESRS, when an undertaking concludes
that an impact, risk or opportunity is not covered or not covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is
material due to its specific facts and circumstances, it shall provide additional entity-specific disclosures to enable
users to understand the undertaking’s sustainability-related impacts, risks or opportunities. Application
requirements AR 1 to AR 5 provide further guidance regarding entity-specific disclosures.
1.2 Reporting areas and minimum content disclosure requirements on policies, actions, targets and metrics
12. The Disclosure Requirements in ESRS 2, in topical ESRS and in sector-specific ESRS are structured into the following reporting areas:
(a) Governance (GOV): the governance processes, controls and procedures used to monitor, manage and oversee
impacts, risks and opportunities (see ESRS 2, chapter 2 Governance);
(b) Strategy (SBM): how the undertaking’s strategy and business model interact with its material impacts, risks and
opportunities, including how the undertaking addresses those impacts, risks and opportunities (see ESRS 2,
chapter 3 Strategy);
(c) Impact, risk and opportunity management (IRO): the process(es) by which the undertaking:
i.identifies impacts, risks and opportunities and assesses their materiality (see IRO-1 in section 4.1 of ESRS 2),
ii.manages material sustainability matters through policies and actions (see section 4.2 of ESRS 2).
(d) Metrics and targets (MT): the undertaking’s performance, including targets it has set and progress towards
meeting them (see ESRS 2, chapter 5 Metrics and targets).
13. ESRS 2 includes:
(a) in section 4.2 Minimum Disclosure Requirements regarding policies (MDR-P) and actions (MDR-A);
(b) in section 5 Minimum Disclosure Requirements regarding metrics (MDR-M) and targets (MDR-T).
The undertaking shall apply the minimum disclosure requirements regarding policies, actions, metrics and targets
together with the corresponding Disclosure Requirements in topical and sector-specific ESRS.
1.3 Drafting conventions
14. In all ESRS:(a) the term “impacts” refers to positive and negative sustainability-related impacts that are connected with the
undertaking’s business, as identified through an impact materiality assessment (see section 3.4 Impact
materiality). It refers both to actual impacts and to potential future impacts.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
