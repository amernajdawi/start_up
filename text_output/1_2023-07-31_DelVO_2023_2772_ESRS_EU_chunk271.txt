ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 271/284Indirect GHG emissions GHG emissions that are a consequence of the activities of an entity but
occur at sources owned or controlled by another entity. Indirect emissions
are Scope 2 GHG emissions and scope 3 GHG emissions combined.
Installation A stationary technical unit within which one or more activities are carried
out which could have an effect on emissions and pollution.
Internal carbon price Price used by an undertaking to assess the financial implications of changes to investment, production, and consumption patterns, and of potential
technological progress and future emissions abatement costs.
Internal carbon pricing scheme An organisational arrangement that allows an undertaking to apply carbon prices in strategic and operational decision making. There are two types of
internal carbon prices commonly used by undertakings. The first type is a
shadow price, which is a theoretical cost or notional amount that the undertaking does not charge but that can be used in assessing the
economic implications or trade-offs for such things as risk impacts, new
investments, net present value of projects, and the cost-benefit of various initiatives. The second type is an internal tax or fee, which is a carbon price
charged to a business activity, product line, or other business unit based on
its GHG emissions (these internal taxes or fees are similar to intracompany
transfer pricing).
Invasive or alien species Species whose introduction and/or spread by human action outside their natural distribution threatens biological diversity , food security, and
human health and well-being. “Alien’ refers to the species’ having been introduced outside its natural distribution (“exotic’, “non-native’ and “non-
indigenous’ are synonyms for “alien’). “Invasive’ means “tending to expand
into and modify ecosystems to which it has been introduced’. Thus, a species
may be alien without being invasive, or, in the case of a species native to a
region, it may increase and become invasive, without actually being an alien
species.
Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) Sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity’, in
terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Sites qualify as global KBAs
if they meet one or more of 11 criteria, clustered into five categories: threatened biodiversity ; geographically restricted biodiversity ; ecological
integrity ; biological processes; and, irreplaceability. The World Database of
KBAs is managed by BirdLife International on behalf of the KBA
Partnership.
Land degradation The many processes that drive the decline or loss in biodiversity , ecosystem
functions or their benefits to people and includes the degradation of all
terrestrial ecosystems.
Landfill A waste disposal site for the deposit of the waste onto or into land (
20).
Land-system (change) The terrestrial component of the Earth system, encompassing all processes and activities related to the human use of land. These include socio-
economic, technological and organisational inputs and arrangements, as
well as the benefits gained from land and the unintended social and
ecological outcomes of societal activities. The land-systems concept
