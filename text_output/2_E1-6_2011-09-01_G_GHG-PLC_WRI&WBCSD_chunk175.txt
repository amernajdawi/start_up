Appendix	B.  Land-Use Change Impacts   
Box [B.1] Key concepts in land-use impacts
Carbon stock refers to the total amount of carbon
stored on a plot of land at any given time in one or
more of the following carbon pools: biomass (above
and below ground), dead organic matter (dead wood
and litter), and soil organic matter.4  A change in carbon 
stock can refer to additional carbon storage within
a pool, the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere
to the carbon stock, or the emission of CO2 to the
atmosphere from the carbon stock.
Land-use change  occurs when the demand for a 
specific land use results in a change in carbon stocks
on that land. A change in carbon stock can occur from
one land-use category to another (e.g., converting
forest to cropland) or within a land-use category (e.g.,
converting a natural forest to a managed forest or
converting agricultural land from till to no-till). Land-
use change does not include changes in crop cover or
crop rotations that occur within the cropland category
or forest harvesting and regeneration into the same
general forest type, for which the regenerated forest
is expected to have comparable carbon stocks to the
harvested forest.  Land-use categories include forest 
land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, and
other lands such as bare soil, rock, ice, etc.5
Land-use change impacts are the emissions and
removals due to land-use change.
