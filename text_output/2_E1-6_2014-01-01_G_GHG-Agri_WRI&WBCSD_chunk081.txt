Land use
category Definition
Forest land An area of high concentra tion of woody biomass. Typically defined
on the basis of a minimum tree height and canopy cover. Forests lands include plantations, primary fo rests, and naturally regenerated
forests with evidence of human intervention   
Cropland Includes rice fields and agro-forestry systems.
Grassland Managed grasslands , rangelands, pasture land.
Wetland Areas of peat extraction and land that is covered or saturated by water
for all or part of the year (e.g., pe atlands) and that does not fall into
other categories.
Settlements All developed land (e.g., roads, buildings, etc.).

9.3 Additional information that may be reported
Besides the required and best practice reporting elements, companies may wish to report
other information to enhance the transparency  and relevance of thei r inventories. This 
information includes:
 Data on the size of C stocks (in metric tonnes C per unit land area)
 Biogenic CO
2 flux data further subdivided by th e type of C stock (e.g., DOM versus
biomass stocks)
 Other GHG flux data further subdivided by the type of non-mechanical source (e.g.,
enteric fermentation versus manure management)

13 This Guidance follows the ‘land-based’ approach for recognizing LUC, as opposed to an ‘activities-
based’ approach. Land-based approaches assess the net emissions of select land-use categories while
activity-based approaches as sess the net emissions of select land-use activities. Both approaches can be
used for developing national GHG inventories for the UNFCCC.
