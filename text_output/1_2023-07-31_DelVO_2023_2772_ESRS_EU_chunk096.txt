ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 98/284AR 41. In line with ESRS 1 chapter 3.7, the undertaking shall disaggregate information on its GHG emissions as
appropriate. For example, the undertaking may disaggregate its Scope 1, 2, 3, or total GHG emissions by country,
operating segments, economic activity, subsidiary, GHG category (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3, and other GHG considered by the undertaking) or source type (stationary combustion, mobile combustion, process
emissions and fugitive emissions).
AR 42. An undertaking might have a different reporting period from some or all of the entities in its value chain. In such
circumstances, the undertaking is permitted to measure its GHG emissions in accordance with paragraph 44 using
information for reporting periods that are different from its own reporting period if that information is obtained
from entities in its value chain with reporting periods that are different from the undertaking’s reporting period,
on the condition that:
(a) the undertaking uses the most recent data available from those entities in its value chain to measure and disclose its greenhouse gas emissions;
(b) the length of the reporting periods is the same; and
(c) the undertaking discloses the effects of significant events and changes in circumstances (relevant to its GHG
emissions) that occur between the reporting dates of the entities in its value chain and the date of the
undertaking’s general purpose financial statements.
AR 43. When preparing the information on gross Scope 1 GHG emissions required under paragraph 48 (a), the
undertaking shall:
(a) calculate or measure GHG emissions from stationary combustion, mobile combustion, process emissions and
fugitive emissions; and use suitable activity data that include the non-renewable fuel consumption;
(b) use suitable and consistent emission factors;
(c) disclose biogenic emissions of CO2 from the combustion or bio-degradation of biomass separately from the Scope 1 GHG emissions, but include emissions of other types of GHG (in particular CH4 and N2O);
(d) not include any removals, or any purchased, sold or transferred carbon credits or GHG allowances in the
calculation of Scope 1 GHG emissions; and
(e) for activities reporting under the EU ETS, report on Scope 1 emissions following the EU ETS methodology. The
EU ETS methodology may also be applied to activities in geographies and sectors that are not covered by the
EU ETS.
AR 44. When preparing the information on the percentage of Scope 1 GHG emissions from regulated emission trading
schemes required under paragraph 48 (b), the undertaking shall:
(a) consider GHG emissions from the installations it operates that are subject to regulated Emission Trading
Schemes (ETS), including the EU-ETS, national ETS and non-EU ETS, if applicable;
(b) only include emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, and NF3;
(c) ensure the same accounting period for gross Scope 1 GHG emissions and GHG emissions regulated under the
ETS; and
(d) calculate the share by using the following formula:
GHG Emissions in (t CO
2eq) from EU ETS installations + national ETS installations + nonEU ETS installations
Scope 1 GHG emissions (t CO2eq)
AR 45. When preparing the information on gross Scope 2 GHG emissions required under paragraph 49, the undertaking
shall:
(a) consider the principles and requirements of the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance (version 2015, in particular
the Scope 2 quality criteria in chapter 7.1 relating to contractual instruments); it may also consider
Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279 or the relevant requirements for the quantification of
indirect GHG emissions from imported energy in EN ISO 14064-1:2018;OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
