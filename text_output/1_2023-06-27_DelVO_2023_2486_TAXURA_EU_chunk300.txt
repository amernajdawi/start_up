ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 110/164(a) national regulatory standards;
(b) where these standards are not available, an internal site-specific risk-assessment taking into account the characteristic
and the extent of the impacted area (land, water body or other), the type, properties (persistence, mobility and toxicity)
and concentration of the substances, preparations, organisms or micro-organisms, possible migration pathways and
the probability of dispersion (70).
3.The remediation activity is conducted in line with best industry practice and includes all of the following elements:
(a) the original operational activity or defective plant and ancillary equipment that led to the contamination has been stopped or addressed so as not to be a potential source of further contamination before any assessment or remediation
activity is undertaken (except long-range transboundary air pollution or other unidentifiable diffuse sources);
(b) preparatory investigations including site-specific surveys and physical, chemical or microbiological data collection are
carried out in line with best industry practice and best available techniques to establish the following elements used to
define the environmental targets for the remediation and evaluate the remedial options:
(i) the location, characteristics and extent of the contaminated site;
(ii) the underlying geological and hydrological conditions;
(iii) the likely quantity, composition and sources of contamination;
(iv) soil and water pollution originating from it as well as the risks to human health and the environment.
(c) the remedial options are analysed in line with Annex II to Directive 2004/35/CE (
71)and the most suitable remedial
measures are defined in a dedicated remediation plan, including monitoring requirements and plan;
(d) any hazardous or non-hazardous waste or contaminated soils extracted or otherwise produced by the remediation
activity is subject to appropriate collection, transport, treatment, recovery or disposal by an authorised operator, in
accordance with legal requirements and care is taken to prevent any mixing of excavated contaminated soils and non-
contaminated soils;
(e) remediation methods do not include reducing pollutant concentrations through dilution or watering down, unless a
full justification, for reason other than cost considerations, is provided in the remediation plan;
(f) control, monitoring or maintenance activities are carried out in the after-care phase of at least 10 years, unless a
different duration sufficient to guarantee long-term risk control is defined in the national law or in the remediation
and monitoring plan (see point 4).
