•Disclose and justify the method used for recycling;
•Use that same method consistently over time to track
performance, or if the method changes recalculate the
base inventory as required in chapter 14; and
•Disclose the calculated virgin material displacement
separately.
The standard also recommends that companies include
quantitative uncertainty results in their inventory report
(e.g., sensitivity analysis).Additionally, a disclaimer is required as part of the
inventory report to avoid incorrect comparisons of
inventory results based on different allocation methods
(see chapter 13 for more details). In cases where choices
are needed in a general standard to accommodate a
large range of products, companies are encouraged
to look towards available product rules and sector
guidance to ensure consistency and comparability (if
desired) within a product category or sector. Companies
can choose a method other than the recycled content
or closed loop approximation based on product rules or
sector guidance as long as this is disclosed and justified
in the inventory report.
