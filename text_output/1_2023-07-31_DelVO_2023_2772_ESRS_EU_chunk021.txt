8. Structure of the sustainability statement
110. This chapter provides the basis for the presentation of the information about sustainability matters prepared in
compliance with Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU (i.e., the sustainability statement
) within the
undertakingâ€™s management report. Such information is presented in a dedicated section of the management report
identified as the sustainability statement. Appendix F Example of structure of ESRS sustainability statement of this
Standard provides an illustrative example of a sustainability statement structured according to the requirements of
this chapter.
8.1 General presentation requirement
111. Sustainability information shall be presented:
(a) in a way that allows a distinction between information required by disclosures in ESRS and other information
included in the management report; and
(b) under a structure that facilitates access to and understanding of the sustainability statement, in a format that is
both human-readable and machine-readable.
8.2 Content and structure of the sustainability statement
112. Except for the possibility to incorporate information by reference in accordance with section 9.1 Incorporation by
reference of this Standard, the undertaking shall report all the applicable disclosures required by ESRS in accordance
with chapter 1 of this Standard, within a dedicated section of the management report.
113. The undertaking shall include in its sustainability statement the disclosures pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation
(EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and the Council (8)and to the Commission Delegated Regulations that
specify the content and other modalities of those disclosures. The undertaking shall ensure that these disclosures are
separately identifiable within the sustainability statement. The disclosures relating to each of the environmental
objectives defined in the Taxonomy Regulation shall be presented together in a clearly identifiable part of the
environmental section of the sustainability statement. These disclosures are not subject to the provisions of ESRS,
with the exception of this paragraph and the first sentence of paragraph 115 of this standard.
114. When the undertaking includes in its sustainability statement additional disclosures stemming from (i) other
legislation which requires the undertaking to disclose sustainability information, or (ii) generally accepted
sustainability reporting standards and frameworks, including non-mandatory guidance and sector-specific guidance,
published by other standard-setting bodies (such as technical material issued by the International Sustainability
Standards Board or the Global Reporting Initiative), such disclosures shall:
(a) be clearly identified with an appropriate reference to the related legislation, standard or framework (see ESRS 2
BP-2, paragraph 15);
(b) meet the requirements for qualitative characteristics of information specified in chapter 2 and Appendix B of this
standard.
115. The undertaking shall structure its sustainability statement in four parts, in the following order: general
information, environmental information (including disclosures pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852),
social information and governance information. Respecting the provision in section 3.6 Material impacts or risks
arising from actions to address sustainability matters of this Standard, when information provided in one part contains
information to be reported in another part, the undertaking may refer in one part to information presented in
another part, avoiding duplications. The undertaking may apply the detailed structure illustrated in Appendix F of
this Standard.
