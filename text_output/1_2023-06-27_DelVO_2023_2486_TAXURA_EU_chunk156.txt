1. Environmental protection and restoration activities
1.1. Conservation, including restoration, of habitats (1), ecosystems (2)and species
Description of the activity
Initiation, development and realisation on own account or on a fee or contract basis, of conservation activities, including
restoration activities, aimed at maintaining or improving the status and trends of terrestrial, freshwater and marine
habitats, ecosystems and populations of related fauna and flora species.
The economic activity includes:
(a) activities of in situ conservation, defined by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) (3)as the conservation of
ecosystems and natural habitats and the maintenance and recovery of viable populations of species in their natural
surroundings;
(b) activities of restoration defined as activities actively or passively assisting the recovery (i) of an ecosystem towards or to
good condition (4); (ii) of a habitat type to the highest level of condition attainable and to its favourable reference area or
natural extent; (iii) of a habitat of a species (5)to a sufficient quality and quantity; or (iv) of species populations to
satisfactory levels.
The economic activity does not include ex situ conservation of components of biological diversity, including in botanical
gardens, zoos, aquaria or seed banks.
The economic activities in this category have no dedicated NACE code but are partially covered under NACE code R91.04
as referred to in the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006. The
activities relate to Class 6 of the statistical classification of environmental protection activities (CEPA) established by
Regulation (EU) No 691/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6).
