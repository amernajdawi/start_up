to the underwriting activities themselves and show what proportion of the overall non-life underwriting activities is
composed of non-life underwriting activities that relate to climate adaptation and which are performed in
accordance with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 (3)(‘Climate Delegated Act’).
(11) Financial undertakings that are subject to the disclosure obligations laid down in Articles 19a and 29a of Directive
2013/34/EU should not take into account the exposure to, or investments in, non-financial undertakings that are
not subject to Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU in the calculation of the numerator of key
performance indicators. An inclusion of such exposures in the numerator may be considered at the time of review
of this Delegated Act which will be accompanied by an impact assessment. Those non-financial undertakings may
still decide to voluntarily disclose their key performance indicators, either to have access to environmentally
sustainable finance as part of specific eco-labelling schemes and environmentally sustainable financial products, or
as part of their overall business strategy based on environmental sustainability.
(12) In view of the entry into force and application of Climate Delegated Act by the end of 2021 and material difficulties
for assessing compliance of economic activities in 2022 with technical screening criteria laid down in that Delegated
Regulation for the previous reporting year, the application of this Regulation in 2022 should be limited to certain
elements and qualitative reporting, with the remaining provisions starting to apply from 1 January 2023 for non-
financial undertakings and from 1 January 2024 for financial undertakings. Moreover, the key performance
indicators of credit institutions related to their trading book and commission and fees for other commercial services
and activities than the provision of financing should apply from 1 January 2026.
(13) Due to the current lack of an appropriate calculation methodology, exposures to central governments, central banks
and supranational issuers should be excluded from the calculation of the numerator and denominator of key
performance indicators. Financial undertakings may, on a voluntary basis, provide information in relation to
exposures to taxonomy aligned bonds and taxonomy aligned debt securities that are issued by central governments,
central banks or supranational issuers. There should be a review by 30 June 2024 that should evaluate the possibility
of inclusion of such exposures in the key performance indicators,
