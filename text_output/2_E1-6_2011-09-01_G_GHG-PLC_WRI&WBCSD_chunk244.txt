Table [C.2] Recommended quality assurance/quality control procedures (continued)
Activity Procedure
Calculating emissions  
and checking calculations
• Aggregation  
of emissions
• Emissions trends • Where possible, compare emissions from each process (or total product emissions)
to previous estimates. If significant departures, check data inputs, assumptions and
calculation methodologies
• Where possible, compare material and energy purchases for each process (or in
total) against generic industry averages
Calculation
methodologies• Reproduce a sample set of emissions and removals calculations to cross-check the
application of calculation methodologies
• Where possible, cross-check calculation methodologies used against more or less
complex methodologies to ensure similar results are achieved
Appendix C. Data Management Plan
• Ensure that the aggregation of emissions from all processes is correct
