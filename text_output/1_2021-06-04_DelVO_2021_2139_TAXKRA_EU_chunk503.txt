(b) for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state-of-the-art
climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios (  110  ) consistent with the expected lifetime 
of the activity, including, at least, 10 to 30 year climate projections scenarios for major investments.
3. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and
take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line
with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports (  111  ), scientific peer-reviewed 
publications and open source (  112  ) or paying models. 
4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people,
of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  113  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  114  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  N/A  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  The activity assesses the availability of and, where feasible, adopts tech ­
niques that support:
(a) reuse and use of secondary raw materials and reused components in
products manufactured;
(b) design for high durability, recyclability, easy disassembly and adapta ­
bility of products manufactured;
(c) waste management that prioritises recycling over disposal, in the
manufacturing process;
(d) information on and traceability of substances of concern throughout
the life cycle of the manufactured products.
