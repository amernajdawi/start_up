(4) Transition to a circular economy  At least 70 % (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and demo ­
lition waste (excluding naturally occurring material referred to in category
17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by Decision
2000/532/EC) generated on the construction site is prepared for reuse,
recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling operations
using waste to substitute other materials, in accordance with the waste
hierarchy and the EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management
Protocol (  588  ). Operators limit waste generation in processes related 
construction and demolition, in accordance with the EU Construction
and Demolition Waste Management Protocol and taking into account
best available techniques and using selective demolition to enable
removal and safe handling of hazardous substances and facilitate reuse
and high-quality recycling by selective removal of materials, using
available sorting systems for construction and demolition waste.
Building designs and construction techniques support circularity and in
particular demonstrate, with reference to ISO 20887 (  589  ) or other 
standards for assessing the disassembly or adaptability of buildings, how
they are designed to be more resource efficient, adaptable, flexible and
dismantleable to enable reuse and recycling.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Building components and materials used in the construction complies with 
the criteria set out in Appendix C to this Annex.
Building components and materials used in the building renovation that
may come into contact with occupiers (  590  ) emit less than 0,06 mg of 
formaldehyde per m  3 of material or component upon testing in 
accordance with the conditions specified in Annex XVII to Regulation
(EC) No 1907/2006 and less than 0,001 mg of other categories 1A and
1B carcinogenic volatile organic compounds per m  3 of material or 
component, upon testing in accordance with CEN/EN 16516 or
ISO 16000-3:2011 (  591  ) or other equivalent standardised test conditions 
and determination methods.
Measures are taken to reduce noise, dust and pollutant emissions during
construction or maintenance works.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  N/A.  
7.3.  Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment  
Description of the activity  
Individual renovation measures consisting in installation, maintenance or repair of energy efficiency equipment. The
economic activities in this category consist in one of the following individual measures, provided that they comply
with minimum requirements set for individual components and systems in the applicable national measures
implementing Directive 2010/31/EU and, where applicable, are rated in the highest two populated classes of
energy efficiency in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 and delegated acts adopted under that Regulation:  
(a) addition of insulation to existing envelope components, such as external walls (including green walls), roofs
(including green roofs), lofts, basements and ground floors (including measures to ensure air-tightness,
measures to reduce the effects of thermal bridges and scaffolding) and products for the application of the
insulation to the building envelope (including mechanical fixings and adhesive);
