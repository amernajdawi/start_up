definition in line with one of the definitions of ecological restoration (  17 ) applied to forest, or forest rehabili ­
tation (  18 ) under the Convention on Biological Diversity. The economic activities also include forest activities in line 
with the FAO definition of ‘reforestation’ (  19 ) and ‘naturally regenerating forest’ (  20 ) after an extreme event, where 
extreme event is defined by national law, and where national law does not contain such a definition, is in line with
the IPCC definition of extreme weather event (  21 ); or after a wildfire, where wildfire is defined by national law, and 
where national law does not contain such a definition, as defined in the European Glossary for wildfires and forest
fires (  22 ). 
The economic activities in this category imply no change of land use and occurs on degraded land matching the
forest definition as set out in national law, or where not available, is in accordance with the FAO definition of
forest (  23 ). 
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code A2 in accordance with the statistical
classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006. The economic activities in this
category are limited to NACE II 02.10, i.e. silviculture and other forestry activities, 02.20, i.e. logging 02.30,
i.e. gathering of wild growing non-wood products and 02.40, i.e. support services to forestry.  
Where an economic activity in this category complies with the substantial contribution criterion specified in
point 5, the activity is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU)
2020/852, provided that it meets the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.EN  9.12.2021 Official Journal of the European Union L 442/157  
( 17 ) Ecological Restoration (Also Ecosystem Restoration):  
— the process of returning an ecosystem to a natural pre-disturbance structure and function;  
— the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed;  
— the process of intentionally altering a site to establish a defined, indigenous ecosystem. The goal of this process is to emu late the
structure, function, diversity and dynamics of the specified ecosystem;  
— human intervention … designed to accelerate the recovery of damaged habitats, or to bring ecosystems back to as close an
approximation as possible of their pre-disturbance states,
