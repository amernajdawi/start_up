5.3.1 Phases and steps of a GHG inventory
The ISO LCA standards define four phases of a LCA
study: the goal and scope definition, inventory analysis,
impact assessment, and interpretation. To report the
results of an LCA study, ISO also defines critical review
and reporting as additional steps. Figure 5.1 shows the
general relationship between the ISO LCA phases of an
LCA study defined by ISO and the steps to complete a
GHG inventory in conformance with this standard.
The life cycle approach is by nature an iterative
technique, where each phase or step is dependent on
the results or methodologies used in another (previous
or subsequent) phase or step. For example, defining
the unit of analysis (as defined in chapter 6) is a step
that directly impacts the subsequent steps of boundary
setting, data collection, and allocation. However, a
company may find that to avoid allocation (as defined
in chapter 9) they need to redefine the unit of analysis.  
Likewise, setting the boundary (chapter 7) is the first step in identifying what data are needed by determining
attributable processes, but data collection limitations
(as defined in chapter 8) may result in excluding some
processes from the inventory results and justifying
those exclusions in the inventory report. Applying the
principles of this standard and clearly setting business
goals will help companies ensure that the decisions taken
while conducting the inventory and interpreting the final
results are relevant to  those goals.
5.3.2 Use of product rules and sector guidance
As mentioned in chapter 1, product comparisons,
beyond tracking product performance over time,
need additional specifications to ensure consistent
application of this standard for a product or product
category. These specifications are provided within a
product rule. A product rule is a document created by
a group of stakeholders with an interest in a particular
product or product category and the goal of building
consensus on the additional specifications needed to
