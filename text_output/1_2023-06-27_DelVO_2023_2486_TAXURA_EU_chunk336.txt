Energy Demand (PED) and demonstrated by adequate evidence, which at least
compares the performance of the relevant asset to the performance of the national or
regional stock built before 31 December 2020 and at least distinguishes between
residential and non-residential buildings.
For buildings built after 31 December 2020, the Primary Energy Demand (PED) (
33)
defining the energy performance of the building resulting from the construction does
not exceed the threshold set for the nearly zero-energy building (NZEB) requirements
in national regulation implementing Directive 2010/31/EU. The energy performance is
certified by an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC).
(32)For activities located in third countries, in accordance with equivalent applicable national law or international standards, that aim at
the conservation of natural habitats, wild fauna and wild flora, and that require to carry out (1) a screening procedure to determine
whether, for a given activity, an appropriate assessment of the possible impacts on protected habitats and species is needed; (2) such
an appropriate assessment where the screening determines that it is needed, for example IFC Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources.
(33)The calculated amount of energy needed to meet the energy demand associated with the typical uses of a building expressed by a
numeric indicator of total primary energy use in kWh/m2 per year and based on the relevant national calculation methodology and as
displayed on the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC).OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
