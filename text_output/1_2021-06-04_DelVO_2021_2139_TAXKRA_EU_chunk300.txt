For combustion plants with thermal input greater than 1 MW but below
the thresholds for the BAT conclusions for large combustion plants to
apply, emissions are below the emission limit values set out in Annex II,
part 2, to Directive (EU) 2015/2193.For plants in zones or parts of zones
not complying with the air quality limit values laid down in Directive
2008/50/EC, measures are implemented to reduce emission levels taking
into account the results of the information exchange (  277  ) which are 
published by the Commission in accordance with Article 6,
paragraphs 9 and 10, of Directive (EU) 2015/2193.
For anaerobic digestion of organic material, where the produced digestate
is used as fertiliser or soil improver, either directly or after composting or
any other treatment, it meets the requirements for fertilising materials set
out in Component Material Categories (CMC) 4 and 5 in Annex II to
Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 or national rules on fertilisers or soil
improvers for agricultural use.
For anaerobic digestion plants treating over 100 tonnes per day, emissions
to air and water are within or lower than the emission levels associated
with the best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set for anaerobic
treatment of waste in the latest relevant best available techniques (BAT)
conclusions, including the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for
waste treatment (  278  ). No significant cross-media effects occur.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
4.9.  Transmission and distribution of electricity  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of transmission systems that transport electricity on the extra high-voltage and high-
voltage interconnected system.  
Construction and operation of distribution systems that transport electricity on high-voltage, medium-voltage and
low-voltage distribution systems.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular D35.12 and
D35.13 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.  
_____________
( 277  ) The final technology report resulting from the exchange of information with Member States, the industries concerned and non- 
governmental organisations contains technical information on best available technologies used in medium combustion plants to
reduce their environmental impacts, and on the emission levels achievable with best available and emerging technologies and the  
related costs (version of 4.6.2021: https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/06f33a94-9829-4eee-b187-21bb783a0fbf/library/9a99a632-
