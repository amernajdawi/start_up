(1) Climate change mitigation For plastic manufactured from chemical recycled feedstock, life-cycle GHG emissions of
the manufactured plastic, excluding any calculated credits from the production of fuels,
are lower than the life-cycle GHG emissions of the equivalent plastic in primary form
manufactured from fossil fuel feedstock. Life-cycle GHG emissions are calculated using
Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279 (
10)or, alternatively, using ISO
14067:2018 (11)or ISO 14064-1:2018 (12). Quantified life-cycle GHG emissions are
verified by an independent third party.
(10)Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279 of 15 December 2021 on the use of the Environmental Footprint methods to
measure and communicate the life cycle environmental performance of products and organisations (OJ L 471, 30.12.2021, p. 1).
