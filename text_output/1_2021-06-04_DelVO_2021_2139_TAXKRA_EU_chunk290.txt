The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan,
such that:
(a) for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using
climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale;
(b) for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state-of-the-art
climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios (  248  ) consistent with the expected lifetime of 
the activity, including, at least, 10 to 30 year climate projections scenarios for major investments.
3. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and
take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line
with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports (  249  ), scientific peer-reviewed 
publications and open source (  250  ) or paying models. 
4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other
people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  251  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  252  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  N/A  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity does not hamper the achievement of good environmental 
status, as set out in Directive 2008/56/EC, requiring that the appropriate
measures are taken to prevent or mitigate impacts in relation to that
Directive’s Descriptor 11 (Noise/Energy), laid down in Annex I to that
Directive, and as set out in Decision (EU) 2017/848 in relation to the
relevant criteria and methodological standards for that descriptor.

( 251  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta n­
eously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more
diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-eff icient
and systemic interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of
ecosystem services (version of 4.6.2021: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/nature-
based-solutions_en/).
