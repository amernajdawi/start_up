ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 61/164(1) Climate change mitigationThe building owner or contractor ensures that during renovation, refurbishing or
demolition activities implying the removal of foam panels, or laminated boards installed in cavities or built up structures, that contain foams with Fluorinated
greenhouse gases, saturated and unsaturated Hydrofluorocarbons, and Ozone
Depleting Substances, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 and in Regulation
(EU) No 1005/2009, the emissions are avoided to the extent possible by handling the
foams or the gases contained therein in a way that ensures the reuse or destruction of
the foam panels or the gases contained in the foams. The recovery of the gases
contained in the foams is carried out by appropriately trained personnel.
Where recovery of these foams is not technically feasible, the operator draws up
documentation providing evidence for the infeasibility of the recovery in the specific
case. Such documentation is retained for five years and is made available, on demand.
(2) Climate change adaptation The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.
(3)
Sustainable use and protec ­
tion of water and marine resourcesThe activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.
(5) Pollution prevention and controlMeasures are taken to reduce noise, dust and pollutant emissions during demolition and wrecking works.

temsThe activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this Annex.
3.4. Maintenance of roads and motorways
Description of the activity
Maintenance of streets, roads and motorways, other vehicular and pedestrian ways, surface work on streets, roads,
highways, bridges, tunnels, aerodrome runways, taxiways and aprons, defined as all actions undertaken to maintain and
restore the serviceability (123)and level of service of roads (124). For bridges and tunnels, the economic activity only includes
the maintenance of the road that runs on the bridge or through the tunnel. It does not include the maintenance of the
bridge or tunnel itself.
The economic activity includes routine maintenance, which can be scheduled on a periodical basis. The economic activity
also includes preventive maintenance and rehabilitation which are defined as works undertaken to preserve or restore
serviceability and to extend the service life (125)of an existing road. The maintenance operation is mainly dedicated to
pavement management and concerns only the following main elements of the road: binder course, surface course and
concrete slabs. The roads in the scope of this economic activity are made of asphalt, concrete or a combination of the two.
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code F42.11 in accordance with the statistical
classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.
(123)‘Serviceability’ refers to the conditions under which a built asset is still considered safe to use.
(124)‘Level of service’ refers to a qualitative or quantitative measure to assess the infrastructure’s ability to cater to the traffic demands
placed on it.
(125)‘Service life’ refers to the period of use in service, i.e. from the date of construction until the date of reconstruction or demolition.OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
