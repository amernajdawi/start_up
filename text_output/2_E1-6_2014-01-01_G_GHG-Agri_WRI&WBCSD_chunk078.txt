 Figure 8-2.  Amortization schedules chosen by comp anies will not match actual patterns 
of change. In this example C sequesters in so il at a non-linear rate following the adoption
of reduced-tillage. But the CO 2 emissions are amortized at a fixed rate, causing actual
fluxes to be either under- or over-estimated in any one reporting period. Note that the
sequestration rates rise due to reduced so il disturbance but slow down as the C stock
becomes saturated due to inherent physiochemical processes.

Chapter 9: Reporting GHG Data
Fundamentally, a credible inve ntory provides information th at is complete, accurate,
consistent and transparent, while meeting the decision-making needs of both internal
management and external stakeholders.   This chapter: 
 Describes information that must be reported in an inventory.
 Outlines additional, sector-specific recommendations for reporting agricultural
GHG fluxes.
 Provides guidance on reporting offset a nd renewable energy projects on farms.

Summary of requirements and main recommendations:
 Companies shall report desc riptive information on inve ntory boundaries and base
periods.
 Companies shall report quantitative information on GHG fluxes following
requirements in the Corporate St andard (and repeated here).
 Companies should follow a set of additional ‘best practice’ recommendations for
reporting agricultural GHG fluxes.
 Any offset credits or renewable energy that are generated on farmland but sold
off-site shall not be reflec ted in inventory totals.  

9.1 Required information
Companies shall publicly report the following information:   
General information on inventor y boundaries and base periods
 The approach used to set th e organizational boundaries  
 An outline of the operational boundaries chos en and, if scope 3 is included, a list
specifying which types of sc ope 3 activities are covered
 The reporting period covered
 Information on the base period, including:  
o The period chosen as the base period  
o The rationale for choosing this period
o The base period recalculation policy  
o Base period inventory totals by cat egory (see below and Figure 9-1)  
o Appropriate context for any changes that trigger recalculation of the base period
inventory  
 Any specific exclusion of sources and/ or operations from the inventory
