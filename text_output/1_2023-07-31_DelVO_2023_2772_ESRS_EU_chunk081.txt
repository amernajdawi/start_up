ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 83/284(b) whether and how these claims and the reliance on carbon credits neither impede nor reduce the achievement of
its GHG emission reduction targets (40), or, if applicable, its net zero target; and
(c) the credibility and integrity of the carbon credits used, including by reference to recognised quality standards.
Disclosure Requirement E1-8 – Internal carbon pricing
62. The undertaking shall disclose whether it applies internal carbon pricing schemes, and if so, how they
support its decision making and incentivise the implementation of climate-related policies and targets.
63. The information required in paragraph 62 shall include:
(a) the type of internal carbon pricing scheme, for example, the shadow prices applied for CapEX or research and
development (R&D) investment decision making, internal carbon fees or internal carbon funds;
(b) the specific scope of application of the carbon pricing schemes (activities, geographies, entities, etc.);
(c) the carbon prices applied according to the type of scheme and critical assumptions made to determine the prices,
including the source of the applied carbon prices and why these are deemed relevant for their chosen application.
The undertaking may disclose the calculation methodology of the carbon prices including the extent to which
these have been set using scientific guidance and how their future development is related to science-based
carbon pricing trajectories; and
(d) the current year approximate gross GHG emission volumes by Scopes 1, 2 and, where applicable, Scope 3 in
metric tonnes of CO2eq covered by these schemes, as well as their share of the undertaking’s overall GHG
emissions for each respective Scope.
Disclosure Requirement E1-9 – Anticipated financial effects from material physical and transition risks and potential
climate-related opportunities
64. The undertaking shall disclose its:
(a) anticipated financial effects from material physical risks;
(b) anticipated financial effects from material transition risks; and
(c) potential to benefit from material climate-related opportunities.
65. The information required by paragraph 64 is in addition to the information on current financial effects required
under ESRS 2 SBM-3 para 48 (d). The objective of this Disclosure Requirement related to:
(a) anticipated financial effects due to material physical risks and transition risks is to provide an understanding
of how these risks have (or could reasonably be expected to have) a material influence on the undertaking’s
financial position, financial performance and cash flows, over the short-, medium- and long- term. The results
of scenario analysis used to conduct resilience analysis as required under paragraphs AR 10 to AR 13 should
inform the assessment of anticipated financial effects from material physical and transition risks.
(b) potential to pursue material climate-related opportunities is to enable an understanding of how the undertaking
may financially benefit from material climate- related opportunities. This disclosure is complementary to the key
performance indicators to be disclosed in accordance with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178.
(40)This information is aligned with Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU Climate Law),
Article 2 (1).OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
