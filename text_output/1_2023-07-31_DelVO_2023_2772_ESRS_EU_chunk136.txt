ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 139/284(c) shall describe whether and how it has incorporated local and indigenous knowledge and nature- based solutions
into biodiversity and ecosystems-related actions.
Metrics and targets
Disclosure Requirement E4-4 – Targets related to biodiversity and ecosystems
29. The undertaking shall disclose the biodiversity and ecosystem-related targets it has set.
30. The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to allow an understanding of the targets the undertaking has adopted
to support its biodiversity and ecosystems policies and address its material related impacts, dependencies, risks and
opportunities.
31. The description of the targets shall follow the mandatory content defined in ESRS 2 MDR-T Tracking effectiveness of
policies and actions through targets.
32. The disclosure required by paragraph 29 shall include the following information:
(a) whether ecological thresholds and allocations of impacts to the undertaking were applied when setting targets. If
so, the undertaking shall specify:i. the ecological thresholds identified and the methodology used to identify such thresholds;
ii. whether or not the thresholds are entity-specific and if so, how they were determined; and
iii. how responsibility for respecting identified ecological thresholds is allocated in the undertaking;
(b) whether the targets are informed by, and/or aligned with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework,
relevant aspects of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 and other biodiversity and ecosystem-related national
policies and legislation;
(c) how the targets relate to the biodiversity and ecosystem impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities identified
by the undertaking in relation to its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain;
(d) the geographical scope of the targets, if relevant;
(e) whether or not the undertaking used biodiversity offsets in setting its targets; and
(f) to which of the layers of the mitigation hierarchy the target can be allocated (i.e., avoidance, minimisation,
restoration and rehabilitation, compensation or offsets).
Disclosure Requirement E4-5 – Impact metrics related to biodiversity and ecosystems change
33. The undertaking shall report metrics related to its material impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems.
34. The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to enable an understanding of the performance of the undertaking
against impacts identified as material in the materiality assessment on biodiversity and ecosystems change.
35. If the undertaking identified sites located in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas that it is negatively affecting (see
paragraph 19(a)), the undertaking shall disclose the number and area (in hectares) of sites owned, leased or managed
in or near these protected areas or key biodiversity areas.
36. If the undertaking has identified material impacts with regards to land-use change, or impacts on the extent and
condition of ecosystems, it may also disclose their land-use based on a Life Cycle Assessment.
37. For datapoints specified in paragraphs 38 to 41, the undertaking shall consider its own operations.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
