Product GHG inventories and corporate inve ntories (when scope 3 emissions are
included) are complementary and they togeth er provide a comprehe nsive approach to
value chain GHG management. For example,  product and corporate inventories are 
mutually supportive when:  
 Corporate inventories are used  to identify products that ar e likely to have the most 
significant GHG footprints based on their us e of highly emitting sources, such as
specific raw materials (e.g., fertilizers).
 Product inventories are used to inform GH G reduction strategies that impact both
product and corporate inventories.  
 Product inventories are used to extrapol ate to relevant upstream and downstream
scope 3 emissions in a corporate inventory.
Companies may wish to complete scope 3 and product GHG invent ories in parallel.
Alternatively, they may develop scope 1 and 2 inventories to supply information
requested by a buyer for the purpos e of its scope 3 and product i nventories. In either case,
companies should be mindful of certain di fferences between this Guidance and the
Product Standard that can affect the extent  to which both types of inventories are 
mutually supportive (Table 1-4).  Table 1-4. Differences in methodologies between this Guidance and the Product 
Standard that affect how useful a corpor ate inventory is for product GHG inventories
(and vice-versa).
GHG reporting
issue Recommendation in the
Agricultural Guidance Requirement in the Product Standard
Scope 3 sources Should be reported   Emissions from all relevant upstream and 
downstream sources shall be reflected in the inventory of a given product (though downstream emissions need not be
considered in cradle-to-farm gate analyses)
CO 2 fluxes
to/from carbon
stocks  in soils   Should be reported  The following fluxes shall be accounted for: 
 CO 2 emissions and removals due to C
stock change occurring as a result of land conversion within or between land use categories (e.g., adoption of no-till practices or land use change)
 Emissions from the preparation of
converted land (e.g., biomass burning or
liming)
 The CO
2 fluxes to/from soils that occur
as a result of subsequent land use (e.g., fertilizer application and harvesting) are optional and may be included, provided CO 2 fluxes
to/from C stocks in biomass and
dead organic
matter  (DOM)   CO
2 emissions should be
reported
 CO 2 removals by woody
vegetation should be reported
 CO 2 removals by
herbaceous vegetation,
should not be reported

the fluxes can be estimated reasonably  

 Biogenic CO2 fluxes shall be reported
separately from non-biogenic fluxes  
Timeline for amortizing the CO
2 fluxes from
changes in carbon
stocks Varies depending on site-
specific conditions In the context of land use change: 20 years
or the length of one harvest, whichever is longer
