(c) vehicles of categories N 2 and N 3, and N 1 classified as heavy-duty vehicles, not
dedicated to transporting fossil fuels with a technically permissible maximum laden mass not exceeding 7,5 tonnes that are ‘zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles’

(d) vehicles of categories N
2 and N 3 not dedicated to transporting fossil fuels with a
