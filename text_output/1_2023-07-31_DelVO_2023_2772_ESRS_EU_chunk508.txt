ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 213/284AR 20. To illustrate how the perspectives of value chain workers have informed specific decisions or activities of the

Disclosure Requirement S2-3 â€“ Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for value chain workers to raise
concerns
AR 21. In fulfilling the requirements set out by Disclosure Requirement ESRS S2-3, the undertaking may be guided by the
content of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises focused on remediation and grievance mechanisms.
AR 22. Channels for raising concerns or needs include grievance mechanisms, hotlines, trade unions (where workers are

the undertaking they are employed by, or contracted to work for, in relation to each material impact.
AR 24. Third party mechanisms could include those operated by the government, NGOs, industry associations and other
