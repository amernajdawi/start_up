ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 60/1642.The operator of the activity conducts a pre-demolition audit in line with the EU Construction and Demolition Waste
Management Protocol (116).
3.All demolition waste generated during the demolition or wrecking activity is treated in accordance with Union waste
legislation and the full checklist of the EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol (117).
4.The preparing for re-use (118)or recycling (119)of the non-hazardous construction and demolition waste generated on the
construction site is at least 90 % (by mass in kilogrammes), excluding backfilling (120). This excludes naturally occurring
material referred to in category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by Decision 2000/532/EC. The
operator of the activity demonstrates compliance with the 90 % threshold by reporting on the Level(s) indicator 2.2 (121)
using the Level 3 reporting format for different waste streams. Alternatively, at least 95 % of the mineral (122)fraction
and 70 % of the non-mineral fraction of the non-hazardous demolition waste is separately collected and prepared for reuse or recycled.

reporting the estimates of Level 2 Demolition Waste, the Excel spreadsheet available on the Commission website is to be used:

amounts and types of CDW and their final destinations (version 1.1), https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/product-
groups/412/documents. For this, each type of demolition waste is tagged with the appropriate six-digit code from the European List
of Waste established by Decision 2000/532/EC. When including the type of waste treatment in the Excel spreadsheet (i.e.
preparation for reuse, for recycling, material recovery, energy recovery or disposal), evidence is included that the economic operators
receiving the waste have the technical capability to carry out this treatment. Such evidence may consist in a link to the company’s webpages where this is documented or a signed statement from a representative of the company. Where the treatment takes place on
the demolition site, such as onsite reuse or recycling, acceptable evidence may consist in a signed statement from a representative of
the company.
(118)‘Preparing for re-use’ means checking, cleaning or repairing recovery operations, by which products or components of products that
have become waste are prepared so that they can be re-used without any other pre-processing. This includes, for instance, the
preparation for re-use of certain parts of buildings like roof elements, windows, doors, bricks, stones or concrete elements. A pre-
requisite for the preparation for re-use of building elements is usually the selective deconstruction of buildings or other structures.
