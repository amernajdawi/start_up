 How should CO 2 fluxes be amortized?  
 Companies  should amortize fluxes evenly over time 
When amortization is necessary, companies should use a linear-rate approach, wherein
the total amount of CO
2 flux is amortized evenly over multiple inventories. This involves
dividing the total flux by the number of y ears in the amortization period and then
reporting the quotient in each year of the amortization period. This approach is recommended because it provides the most cons istent way to distribute impacts for use in
a GHG inventory.

The length of the amortization period is context specific
The length of the amortization period may va ry depending on the stock concerned and the
quantification approach. In general, the am ortization period for a ny one stock should be:
 The length of the time dependence of the st ock change factor or emission factor;
or
 For woody biomass stocks, the length of the nominal harvest/ maturity cycle.
The second condition assumes that woody vege tation accumulates biomass for a finite
period until it is removed through harvest or re aches a steady state where there is no net
accumulation of C in biomass because growth rates have slowed and incremental gains from growth are offset by losses from na tural mortality, pruning or other losses.  
In the absence of other information, compan ies may assume an amortization period of 20
years for DOM stocks and the organic C stocks in mineral soils. This 20-year value is the
default time horizon in national GHG inve ntories submitted to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
11. This value may be too long
for certain stocks (e.g., soil stock changes in  tropical biomes) and too short for others 
(soil stock changes in boreal biomes). Companies may alternatively assume more specific
values used by individual countries  in their national inventories12.
