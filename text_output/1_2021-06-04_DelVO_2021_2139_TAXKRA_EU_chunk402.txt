(c) WCs, including suites, bowls and flushing cisterns, have a full flush
volume of a maximum of 6 litres and a maximum average flush
volume of 3,5 litres;
(d) urinals use a maximum of 2 litres/bowl/hour. Flushing urinals have a
maximum full flush volume of 1 litre.
To avoid impact from the construction site, the activity complies with the
criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  At least 70 % (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and demo ­
lition waste (excluding naturally occurring material referred to in category
17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by Decision
2000/532/EC) generated on the construction site is prepared for reuse,
recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling operations
using waste to substitute other materials, in accordance with the waste
hierarchy and the EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management
Protocol (  572  ). Operators limit waste generation in processes related to 
construction and demolition, in accordance with the EU Construction
and Demolition Waste Management Protocol and taking into account
best available techniques and using selective demolition to enable
removal and safe handling of hazardous substances and facilitate reuse
and high-quality recycling by selective removal of materials, using
available sorting systems for construction and demolition waste.
Building designs and construction techniques support circularity and in
particular demonstrate, with reference to ISO 20887 (  573  ) or other 
standards for assessing the disassembly or adaptability of buildings, how
they are designed to be more resource efficient, adaptable, flexible and
dismantleable to enable reuse and recycling.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Building components and materials used in the construction comply with 
the criteria set out in Appendix C to this Annex.
Building components and materials used in the construction that may
come into contact with occupiers (  574  ) emit less than 0,06 mg of formal ­
dehyde per m  3 of material or component upon testing in accordance with 
the conditions specified in Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006
and less than 0,001 mg of other categories 1A and 1B carcinogenic
volatile organic compounds per m  3 of material or component, upon 
testing in accordance with CEN/EN 16516 (  575  ) or ISO 16000-3 (  576  ) or 
other equivalent standardised test conditions and determination
methods (  577  ). 
Where the new construction is located on a potentially contaminated site
(brownfield site), the site has been subject to an investigation for potential
contaminants, for example using standard ISO 18400 (  578  ). 
Measures are taken to reduce noise, dust and pollutant emissions during
construction or maintenance works.
