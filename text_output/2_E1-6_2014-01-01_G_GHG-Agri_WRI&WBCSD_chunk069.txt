Recommended CO 2 fluxes
The following CO 2 fluxes should be include d in inventories:   
1. CO 2 emissions from, and atmospheric removals by, organic C stocks in mineral and
organic soils  
2. CO 2 emissions from, and atmospheric removals by, below-ground and above-ground
woody biomass (e.g., woody vegetation in or chards, vineyards and agroforestry
systems)
3. CO 2 emissions from the combustion of herbaceous biomass (e.g., open burning of
crop residues)
4. CO 2 emissions from DOM
These fluxes should be reported within a spec ial ‘Biogenic Carbon’ category that is
outside of the scopes. The one exception concerns the CO
2 emissions from soils and
woody biomass that result from LUC. These LUC CO 2 emissions should be reported
within the scopes because they effectively constitute permanent losses of C to the
atmosphere (see Chapter 9.1).  The CH
4 and N 2O emissions from all C stocks (e.g., from biomass or DOM combustion)
shall always be reporte d in the scopes.    

Additional CO 2 fluxes that may be reported  

1. Fluxes to/from inorga nic soil carbon stocks

10 This Guidance does not recommend a minimum soil depth for measuring soil C stocks.

In contrast to soil organic C stocks, inor ganic C stocks are slow to respond to
management changes and often will not exhibit significant changes. Moreover,
quantifying such changes requires a deta iled understanding of site hydrology and
mineralogy. For instance, it may require follo wing the fate of discharged dissolved
inorganic C and base cations (e.g., Ca and Mg ) from the managed land, at least until they
are fully captured in the oceanic inorganic C cycle. Such analyses are highly complicated.
For these reasons, companies can exclude the ne t fluxes to/from inorganic soil C stocks.   
However, certain management practices can be expected to significant ly affect inorganic
C stocks by changing soil chemistry and i nducing the breakdown of  carbonates, leading 
to CO
2 emissions. For instance, use of ammonium sulfate fertilizer to lower soil pH will
tend to promote CO 2 emissions from inorganic C. In such cases, companies should
consider quantifying the CO 2 emissions.  

2. Sequestration in organic soils.  
In wetland environments with organic soils, the rates of C sequestration are relatively
slow and can be assumed to be negligib le. They therefore can be excluded.
