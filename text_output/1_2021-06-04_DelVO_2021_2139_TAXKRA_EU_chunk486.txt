reference CO  2 emissions value defined for heavy duty vehicles (vehicle subgroup 5-LH) in accordance with 
Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242;  
(iv) until 31 December 2025, the vessels have an attained Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) value 10 %
below the EEDI requirements applicable on 1 April 2022 (  96 ) if the vessels are able to run on zero direct 
(tailpipe) CO  2 emission fuels or on fuels from renewable sources (  97 ); 
(m) sea and coastal passenger water transport vessels, not dedicated to transporting fossil fuels, that:  
(i) have zero direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emissions;  
(ii) until 31 December 2025, hybrid and dual fuel vessels derive at least 25 % of their energy from zero direct
(tailpipe) CO  2 emission fuels or plug-in power for their normal operation at sea and in ports;EN  9.12.2021 Official Journal of the European Union L 442/181  
( 94 ) The Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator is defined as the ratio of mas of CO  2 emitted per unit of transport work. It is a 
representative value of the energy efficiency of the ship operation over a consistent period which represents the overall tradi ng
pattern of the vessel. Guidance on how to calculate this indicator is provided in the document MEPC.1/Circ. 684 from IMO.  
( 95 ) Energy Efficiency Design Index (version of 4.6.2021: http://www.imo.org/fr/MediaCentre/HotTopics/GHG/Pages/EEDI.aspx).  
( 96 ) As agreed by the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organization on its seventy-fourth
session.  
( 97 ) Fuels that meet the technical screening criteria specified in Sections 3.10 and 4.13 of this Annex.
