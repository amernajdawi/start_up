ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 3/164(8) The technical screening criteria for determining under which conditions an economic activity qualifies as
contributing substantially to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources should reflect the
need to achieve good status for all water bodies and good environmental status for marine waters, and to prevent the deterioration of water bodies that already have good status or marine waters that are already in good
environmental status. It is therefore appropriate to focus first on those economic activities and sectors that have the
greatest potential to achieve those aims.
(9) The Union framework for water protection (
6)ensures an integrated approach to water management, respecting the
integrity of whole ecosystems. The technical screening criteria should therefore aim at addressing the adverse effects of urban and industrial waste water discharges, protecting human health from the adverse impact of any
contamination of water intended for human consumption, improving water management and the efficiency of
water use, ensuring the sustainable use of marine ecosystem services, contributing to the good environmental status of marine waters and to the overall achievement and maintenance of good status or good potential of bodies of
water, including bodies of surface water and groundwater. Technical screening criteria for urban waste water
treatment as activity providing a substantial contribution to one or more environmental objectives should be reviewed and where necessary revised, taking into account relevant Union law, including Council Directive 91/271/EEC (
7).
(10) As regards solutions inspired and supported by nature, which provide environmental, social and economic benefits
and help build resilience, the technical screening criteria should aim at preventing and protecting against floods or
droughts while enhancing natural water retention, biodiversity and water quality.
(11) The transition to a circular economy is an enabler of environmental sustainability that generates significant benefits for the sustainable management of water, the protection and conservation of biodiversity, the prevention and control of pollution and the mitigation of climate change. The circular economy reflects the need for economic activities to
promote efficient use of resources through appropriate re-use and recycling of resources. The technical screening
criteria for determining under which conditions an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to the transition to a circular economy should therefore ensure that in the design and production phase, the operator takes
into account the long-term value retention and waste reduction of the product over its lifecycle. During its use phase,
the product should be subject to maintenance to extend its life, while reducing the amount of waste. The product should be dismantled or treated after its use to ensure that it can be re-used or recycled for the manufacturing of
another product. That approach can limit the dependency of the Unionâ€™s economy on materials imported from
third countries, which is particularly important in respect of critical raw materials. It is therefore appropriate to
focus first on those economic activities and sectors that have the greatest potential to achieve those aims.
