2. The implementation of the technologies, products or other solutions being researched for the direct air
capture of CO  2 in the atmosphere has the potential to result in overall net GHG emissions reductions once 
commercialised.
3. Where the researched, developed or innovated technology, product or other solution is at TRL 1 to 7, life-
cycle GHG emissions are evaluated in simplified form by the entity carrying out the research. The entity
demonstrates one of the following, where applicable:
(a) a patent not older than 10 years associated with the technology, product or other solution, where
information on its GHG emission reduction potential has been provided;
(b) a permit obtained from a competent authority for operating the demonstration site associated with the
innovative technology, product or other solution for the duration of the demonstration project, where
information on its GHG emission reduction potential has been provided.
Where the researched, developed or innovated technology, product or other solution is at TRL 8 or higher, life-
cycle GHG emissions are calculated using Recommendation 2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using
ISO 14067:2018 (  318  ) or ISO 14064-1:2018 (  319  ) and are verified by an independent third party.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The researched technology, product or other solution complies with the 
criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  Any potential risks to the good status or the good ecological potential of 
bodies of water, including surface water and groundwater, or to the good
environmental status of marine waters from the researched technology,
product or other solution are evaluated and addressed.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Any potential risks to the circular economy objectives from the researched 
technology, product or other solution are evaluated and addressed, by
considering the types of potential significant harm as set out in
Article 17(1), point (d), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Any potential risks to generate a significant increase in the emissions of 
pollutants to air, water or land from the researched technology, product or
other solution are evaluated and addressed.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  Any potential risks to the good condition or resilience of ecosystems or to 
the conservation status of habitats and species, including those of Union
interest, from the researched technology, product or other solution are
evaluated and addressed.
