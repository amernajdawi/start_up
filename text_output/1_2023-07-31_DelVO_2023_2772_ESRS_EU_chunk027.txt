Application Requirements
This appendix is an integral part of ESRS 1 and has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard.
Entity specific disclosuresAR 1. The entity-specific disclosures shall enable users to understand the undertakingâ€™s impacts, risks and opportunities
in relation to environmental, social or governance matters.
AR 2. When developing entity-specific disclosures, the undertaking shall ensure that:
(a) the disclosures meet the qualitative characteristics of information as set out in chapter 2 Qualitative
characteristics of information; and
(b) its disclosures include, where applicable, all material information related to the reporting areas of governance;
strategy; impact, risk and opportunity management; and metrics and targets (see ESRS 2 chapters 2 to 5).
AR 3. When determining the usefulness of metrics for inclusion in its entity-specific disclosures, the undertaking shall
consider whether:
(a) its chosen performance metrics provide insight into:
i.how effective its practices are in reducing negative outcomes and/or increasing positive outcomes for
people and the environment (for impacts); and/or
ii.the likelihood that its practices result in financial effects on the undertaking (for risks and opportunities);
(b) the measured outcomes are sufficiently reliable, meaning that they do not involve an excessive number of
assumptions and unknowns that would render the metrics too arbitrary to provide a faithful representation;
and
(c) it has provided sufficient contextual information to interpret performance metrics appropriately, and whether variations in such contextual information may impact the comparability of the metrics over time.
AR 4. When developing its entity-specific disclosures, the undertaking shall carefully consider:
(a) comparability between undertakings, while still ensuring relevance of the information provided, recognising
that comparability may be limited for entity- specific disclosures. The undertaking shall consider whether the
available and relevant frameworks, initiatives, reporting standards and benchmarks (such as technical material
issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board or the Global Reporting Initiative) provide elements
that can support comparability to the maximum extent possible; and
(b) comparability over time: consistency of methodologies and disclosures is a key factor for achieving
comparability over time.
AR 5. Further guidance for developing entity-specific disclosures can be found by considering the information required under topical ESRS that addresses similar sustainability matters.
Double materiality
