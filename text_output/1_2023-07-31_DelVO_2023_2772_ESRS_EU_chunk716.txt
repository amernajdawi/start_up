Freshwater Groundwater and surface water, with a mean annual salinity of < 0,5 ‰ (i.e.,
the limit mentioned in Annex II of the Water Framework Directive).
GHG emission reduction Decrease in the undertaking’s Scope 1, 2, 3 or total GHG emissions at the
end of the reporting period, relative to emissions in the base year. Emission
reductions may result from, among others, energy efficiency, electrification,
suppliers' decarbonisation, electricity mix decarbonisation, sustainable
products development or changes in reporting boundaries or activities
(e.g., outsourcing, reduced capacities), provided they are achieved within
the undertaking's own operations and upstream and downstream value
chain. Removals and avoided emissions are not counted as emission
reductions.
GHG removal and storage (Anthropogenic) removals refer to the withdrawal of GHGs from the
atmosphere as a result of deliberate human activities. These include
enhancing biological anthropogenic sinks of CO2 and using chemical
engineering to achieve long-term removal and storage. Carbon capture and
storage (CCS) from industrial and energy-related sources, which alone does
not remove CO2 from the atmosphere, can remove atmospheric CO2 if it is OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
