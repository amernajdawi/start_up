CHAPTER 14 Setting Reduction Targets and Tracking Inventory Changes
guidance14.3.2	 Using	offsets	to	achieve	reduction	targets
Companies should strive to achieve their reduction
targets entirely from emission sources within the
inventory boundary. If the company is unable to meet
the target through those reductions, it can use offsets
that are generated from sources external to its inventory
boundary. Any purchased, sold, or banked offsets relevant
to the inventory results are subject to the same reporting
requirements as defined in chapter 13 and therefore are
reported separately from the inventory results.
Although the inventory results are presented on a unit of
analysis basis, companies that purchase offsets for their
products should do so for all products sold in a particular
time frame (e.g., a year). For example, a company
produces a million products a year at 50 kg CO2e per unit
of analysis. To meet a zero-carbon reduction target for
this product, the company needs to purchase 50,000
tons of offsets each year. In this case, the company would
report the inventory results per unit of analysis and the
total amount of products that are offset over the selected
time frame. Companies should also disclose information
on the credibility of the offset, including:
•The type of project
•Geographical and organizational origin
•How offsets have been quantified
•How double counting of offsets has been avoided
•Whether the offsets have been certified or recognized
by external programsIt is important to ensure the offsets used to meet a
reduction target are based on credible accounting
standards. In addition, companies should ensure steps to
avoid double counting of reductions by multiple entities
or in multiple targets. For example, if a company sells
offsets that occur at sources included in its inventory
boundary, these reductions should not be included in
tracking performance towards a reduction target that is
applicable to the same sources.
For additional guidance on using offsets that are based
on credible accounting methodologies and standards
see GHG Protocol Guideline for Project Accounting  and 
to avoid double counting in achieving targets see the
Corporate Standard  (chapter 11, pp 81-83).

1  If a change in emission factor represents an actual change in 
emissions, then the base inventory does not need to be updated.
However, if an emission factor is updated to be more complete or
have less uncertainty, this may warrant a base inventory recalculation.
