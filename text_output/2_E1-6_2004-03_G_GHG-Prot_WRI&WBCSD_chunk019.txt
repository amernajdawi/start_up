AN ILLUSTRATION:  
THE EQUITY SHARE AND CONTROL APPROACHES
Holland Industries is a chemicals group comprising
a number of companies/joint ventures active in theproduction and marketing of chemicals. Table 2 outlinesthe organizational structure of Holland Industries andshows how GHG emissions from the various whollyowned and joint operations are accounted for underboth the equity share and control approaches.
In setting its organizational boundary, Holland
Industries first decides whether to use the equity orcontrol approach for consolidating GHG data at thecorporate level. It then determines which operations at
the corporate level meet its selected consolidationapproach. Based on the selected consolidation approach,the consolidation process is repeated for each loweroperational level. In this process, GHG emissions arefirst apportioned at the lower operational level(subsidiaries, associate, joint ventures, etc.) before theyare consolidated at the corporate level. Figure 1 pres-ents the organizational boundary of Holland Industriesbased on the equity share and control approaches.

CHAPTER 3 Setting Organizational Boundaries 23GUIDANCE
In this example, Holland America (not Holland Industries) holds
a 50 percent interest in BGB and a 75 percent interest in IRW. Ifthe activities of Holland Industries itself produce GHG emissions(e.g., emissions associated with electricity use at the head office),then these emissions should also be included in the consolidationat 100 percent.NOTES
1The term “operations” is used here as a generic term to denote any
kind of business activity, irrespective of its organizational, gover-nance, or legal structures.
2Financial accounting standards use the generic term “control” for whatis denoted as “financial control” in this chapter.TABLE 2. Holland Industries - organizational structure and GHG emissions accounting

STANDARD 24fter a company has determined its organizational boundaries in terms of the operations that it owns or controls, it then sets its operational boundaries. This involves identifying emissions associated with its operations,categorizing them as direct and indirect emissions, and choosing the scope ofaccounting and reporting for indirect emissions.
