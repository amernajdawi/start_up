4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other
people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  186  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  187  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  Electricity consumption for electrolysis and chlorine treatment is equal or 
lower than 2,45 MWh per tonne of chlorine.
Average direct greenhouse gas emissions of the electricity used for chlorine
production is at or lower than 270 g CO  2 e/kWh.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix C to this 
Annex.
Emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the latest relevant
best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including:
(a) the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for the production of
chlor-alkali (  188  ); 
(b) the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste
water and waste gas treatment/management systems in the chemical
sector (  189  ). 
No significant cross-media effects occur.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix C to this 
Annex.  
___________  
( 186  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta neously 
provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nat ure
and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and syste mic
interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosystem service s
