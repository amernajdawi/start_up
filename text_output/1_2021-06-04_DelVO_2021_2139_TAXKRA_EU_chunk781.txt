4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people,
of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  467  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  468  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  N/A  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  N/A  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Measures are in place to manage waste, in accordance with the waste 
hierarchy, both in the use phase (maintenance) and the end-of-life
including through reuse and recycling of batteries and electronics (in
particular critical raw materials therein).  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  N/A  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  N/A  
6.5.  Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and commercial vehicles  
Description of the activity  
Purchase, financing, leasing and operation of vehicles designated as category M1 (  469  ), N1 (  470  ) both falling under 
the scope of Regulation (EC) No 715/2007, or L (2- and 3-wheel vehicles and quadricycles) (  471  ). 
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular H49.32, H49.39
and N77.11 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.  
_____________
( 467  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta neously 
provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse,
nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient an d
