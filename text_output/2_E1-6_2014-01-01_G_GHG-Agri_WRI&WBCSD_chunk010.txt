GHG emissions . The terms ‘ farm ’ , ‘ farmland ’ and ‘ agricultural land ’ are also used interchangeably to refer to the land on which agriculture is practiced . 2 See paragraph 1 of ‘ Report of the Conference of the Parties on its fifteenth session , held in Copenhagen from 7 to 19 December 2009 ’ ( http : / / unfccc . int / documentation / documents / adva nced_search / items / 6911 . php ? priref = 600005735 ) - - - Page 6 of 103 - - - GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance

 (Figure 1-1), and together they  directly contributed about 11%3 of total global 
anthropogenic emissions in 2010, and roughly 60% of all nitrous oxide (N 2O) emissions
and 50% of all methane (CH 4) emissions in 2007 (Smith et al., 2007a). Land use change  
(LUC), caused by the conversion of native habita ts to farmland, contributes a comparable
amount of emissions (Houghton, 2012). Finally, the production of agricultural inputs and
various downstream activities, such as the processing and transport of agricultural
products, contributes a further 3 - 6 % of global emissions (Vermuelen et al., 2012).

1.2 What is the Greenhouse Gas Protocol?

The GHG Protocol is a multi-stakeholder pa rtnership of businesses, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), governments and ot hers convened by the World Resources
Institute (WRI) and the World Business Counc il for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).
Launched in 1998, the mission of the GHG Protocol  is to develop and promote the use of 
industry-accepted best practices for GHG accounting. To date, the GHG Protocol has
released four standards that define best practices for how GHG emissions inventories
should be performed at the enterprise, proj ect, and product levels (Table 1-1). All
publications are available from the GHG Protocol website ( www.ghgprotocol.org ).

This Guidance defines agriculture as
the cultivation of animals, plants, and fungi for food, fiber, biofuels,
drugs or other purposes .*

1.3 Why an Agricultural Guidance?

The Corporate Standard pr ovides a high-level, cross-
sector accounting framework. But, it does not address many accounting and reporting issues specific to agriculture. These include:
 The profound influence of environmental factors on
agricultural GHG fluxes  (emissions or removals)
4,
which complicates efforts to separate anthropogenic from non-anthropogenic effect s and thus ensure that
GHG inventories are useful as management tools.
 Obtaining accurate, site-specific flux data  when environmental conditions vary a lot 
across landscapes.  
 Setting and tracking progress toward emi ssion reduction goals against a background
of highly variable GHG fluxes.  

4 GHG fluxes are the emissions to or re movals from the atmosphere of GHGs.
