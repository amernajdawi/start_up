10.2.  Reinsurance  
Description of the activity  
Coverage of risks stemming from climate-related perils set out in Appendix A to this Annex ceded by the insurer
to the reinsurer. The coverage is set out in an agreement between insurer and reinsurer specifying the insurers’
products (‘underlying product’) from which the ceded risks originate. A reinsurance intermediary (  643  ) may be 
involved in the preparation or conclusion of the contractual agreement between the insurer and the reinsurer.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code K65.20 in accordance with to the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1) point (b) of Regulation
(EU) 2020/852 where it meets the technical screening criteria set out this section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. Leadership in modelling and pricing of climate risks:  
1.1. The reinsurance activity uses state-of-the-art modelling techniques that:
(a) are used to properly reflect in the premium level the exposure, hazard and vulnerability to climate change risks
as well as actions taken by the policyholder of the insurer to protect the insured asset or activity against those
risks, where such information is provided by the insurer to the reinsurer;
(b) do not only rely on historical trends;
(c) integrate forward-looking scenarios.
1.2. The reinsurer discloses publicly how the risks stemming from climate-related perils are considered in the
reinsurance activity.
2. Supporting development and supply of enabling non-life reinsurance products:  
2.1. The reinsurance activity’s underlying products cover risks stemming from climate-related perils and reward,
in a risk-based manner and without prejudice to legal restrictions on contractual conditions and insurance
premiums, preventive actions taken by the insurer’s policyholders.
2.2. The reinsurance activity complies with one or more of the following criteria:
(a) where desired by the insurer, the reinsurer engages with the insurer, either directly or via a reinsurance
intermediary, during the development of the underlying product by:
(i) discussing possible reinsurance solutions that the reinsurer is willing to offer in relation to that product.
The final product is brought to market using one of the reinsurance solutions that were discussed with the
reinsurer during the product development phase;
(ii) providing data or other technical advice enabling the insurer to price the coverage for risks stemming from
climate-related perils as well as risk-based rewards for preventive actions taken by the insurer’s policy ­
holders;
(b) the insurer would likely reduce or discontinue its coverage under the underlying product without the
reinsurance agreement or a comparable reinsurance agreement in place;
