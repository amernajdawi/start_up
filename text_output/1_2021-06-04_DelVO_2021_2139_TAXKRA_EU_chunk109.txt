Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The activity complies with either of the following criteria:
(a) the electricity generation facility is a run-of-river plant and does not have an artificial reservoir;
(b) the power density of the electricity generation facility is above 5 W/m  2 ; 
(c) the life-cycle GHG emissions from the generation of electricity from hydropower, are lower than
100 g CO  2 e/kWh. The life-cycle GHG emissions are calculated using Recommendation 2013/179/EU or, 
alternatively, using ISO 14067:2018 (  162  ), ISO 14064-1:2018 (  163  ) or the G-res tool (  164  ). Quantified life- 
cycle GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  1. The activity complies with the provisions of Directive 2000/60/EC, 
in particular with all the requirements laid down in Article 4 of the
Directive.
2. For operation of existing hydropower plants, including refurbishment
activities to enhance renewable energy or energy storage potential, the
activity complies with the following criteria:
2.1. In accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular Articles
4 and 11 of that Directive, all technically feasible and ecologically relevant
mitigation measures have been implemented to reduce adverse impacts on
water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on
water.
2.2. Measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems
naturally present in the affected water bodies:
(a) measures to ensure downstream and upstream fish migration (such as
fish friendly turbines, fish guidance structures, state-of-the-art fully
functional fish passes, measures to stop or minimise operation and
discharges during migration or spawning);
(b) measures to ensure minimum ecological flow (including mitigation of
rapid, short-term variations in flow or hydro-peaking operations) and
sediment flow;
(c) measures to protect or enhance habitats.
