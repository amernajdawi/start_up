(b) contributing to adaptation efforts of other people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other
economic activities.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  1.  Restoration plan  
1.1. The area is covered by a restoration plan, which is consistent with
the Ramsar Convention’s principles and guidelines on wetland restoration,
until the area is classified as a wetland and is covered by a wetland
management plan, consistent with the Ramsar Convention’s guidelines
for management planning for Ramsar sites and other wetlands. For peat ­
lands, the restoration plan follows the recommendations contained in
relevant resolutions of the Ramsar Convention, including the resolution
XIII/13.
1.2. The restoration plan contains careful consideration of local hydro ­
logical and pedological conditions, including the dynamics of soil satu ­
ration and the change of aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
1.3. All wetland management relevant DNSH criteria are addressed in the
restoration plan.
1.4. The restoration plan provides for monitoring which ensures the
correctness of the information contained in the plan, in particular as
regards the data relating to the involved area.
2. Audit  
Within two years after the beginning of the activity and every 10 years
thereafter, the compliance of the activity with the substantial contribution
to climate change mitigation criteria and with the DNSH criteria are
verified by either of the following:
(a) the relevant national competent authorities;
(b) an independent third-party certifier, at the request of national
authorities or the operator of the activity.
In order to reduce costs, audits may be performed together with any forest
certification, climate certification or other audit.
The independent third-party certifier may not have any conflict of interest
with the owner or the funder, and may not be involved in the devel ­
opment or operation of the activity.  
Group assessment  
The compliance with the DNSH criteria may be checked at the level of a
group of holdings sufficiently homogeneous to evaluate the risk of the
sustainability of the forest activity, provided that all those holdings have a
durable relationship between them and participate in the activity and the
group of those holdings remains the same for all subsequent audits.EN  9.12.2021 Official Journal of the European Union L 442/175
