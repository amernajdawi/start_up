The main ruminant livestock are cattle , buffalo , goats , sheep , and deer . Non - ruminant livestock ( horses , mules , donkeys ) and monogastric li vestock ( swine ) have relatively lower CH 4 emissions .  Quantity and composition of feed . Generally , the higher the feed intake , the higher the CH 4 emissions .  Age and size of livestock . Feed intake incr eases with animal size , growth rate , and production ( e . g . , milk production , w ool growth , or pregnancy ) .

Soil amendments and soil management (N 2O)
Direct and indirect emissions of N 2O also occur from soils following increases in
available N (see Box 4-1) from:  
 Synthetic N fertilizers and organic fertiliz ers (e.g., animal manure, compost, sewage
sludge, and rendering waste).
 Urine and dung that is deposited onto pastures, ranges and paddocks by grazing
animals.
 Incorporation of crop residue s into soils and N-fixati on by legumes. (Note: crop
residue management and legume growing can  reduce field fertilizer requirements 
and ultimately reduce overall soil N 2O emissions.)
 N mineralisation  associated with the loss of soil organic matter and caused by 
changes in land use or soil management, su ch as the drainage or management of
organic soils (i .e. histosols).

Manure management (CH
4 and N 2O)
Manure  management releases both CH 4 and N 2O, although the emissions of these GHGs 
are influenced by different factors.

CH 4 is emitted during the storage and treatmen t of manure under anaerobic conditions. It
is most readily emitted when:
 Large numbers of animals are managed in a confined area (e.g., dairy farms, beef
feedlots, and swine and poultry farms).
 When manure is stored or treated as a liquid (e.g., in lagoons, ponds, tanks, or pits).
In contrast, when manure is handled as a soli d (e.g., in stacks or piles) or when it is
deposited onto pastures and rangelands, it tends to decompose under more aerobic conditions, producing less CH
4.
N
2O is emitted either directly or indirectly from stored or treated manures (see Box 4-1).
N2O emissions are influenced by:
 The N and C content of the manure, and the duration of storage and type of
treatment.  
 Temperature and time - comparatively simple forms of organic N, such as urea
(mammals) and uric acid (poultry)  tend to lead to indirect N 2O emissions more 
quickly.  
 The leaching and run-off of N from treatment units.

 Box 4-1.  Indirect and direct N 2O emissions from soils 
N2O emissions on farms are controlled by the suppl y of available N. Increases in available N,
through the addition of fertilizers or animal wast es to soils, or from the storage and treatment of
manure, stimulate denitrification and nitrification processes, which lead to N 2O emissions. The
actual N 2O emissions may occur directly from the site of manure storage or fertilizer application,
or they may occur indirectly, via leaching and volatilization . Volatilized N is ultimately deposited
onto soils or onto the surface of lakes and other water bodies, where N 2O emissions then occur.
Leached N leads to N 2O emissions in the groundwater below the farm and in ditches, rivers,
estuaries, etc., that eventually recei ve the leachate. While indirect N 2O emissions may occur off
the farm, they are accounted for in the same way as direct N 2O emissions in this Guidance.
