The use of multiple performa nce metrics is recommended  
Companies might find it useful to track perfor mance using more than one metric. This is
because individual metrics might exclude certai n sources, such as those associated with
by-products or co-products (see below) or those not directly  connected to the production 
system. For the same reason, performance me trics should always be reported alongside
data on the absolute GHG fluxes to/from a farm. The following scenarios show the
importance of using additional ratio indica tors (in addition to reporting absolute GHG
flux data) to track performan ce at the whole farm level:
 Production intensification (e.g., an increased  use of fertilizers and/or feed) might 
boost yields and result in a ne t reduction in GHG intensity per 	unit of agricultural 
output (provided the inputs are not excessive ), but could also increase emissions on a
per hectare basis.   
 Increasing the feed conversion efficiency of  cattle can reduce emissions per product, 
but can lead to greater overall emissions (a nd emissions per ha) if any spare feed is
diverted to new livestock. 	
Table I-1 describes various trade-offs asso ciated with different  types of metrics 
commonly used in the agricultural sector.
