that are to be taken into account as a minimum in the climate risk and vulnerability assessment.OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN

Generic criteria for DNSH to sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources
Environmental degradation risks related to preserving water quality and avoiding water stress are identified and
addressed with the aim of achieving good water status and good ecological potential as defined in Article 2, points
(22) and (23), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC (1)and a water use and
protection management plan, developed thereunder for the potentially affected water body or bodies, in consultation
with relevant stakeholders.
Where an Environmental Impact Assessment is carried out in accordance with Directive 2011/92/EU and includes an
assessment of the impact on water in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC, no additional assessment of impact on
water is required, provided the risks identified have been addressed.
The activity does not hamper the achievement of good environmental status of marine waters or does not deteriorate
marine waters that are already in good environmental status as defined in point 5 of Article 3 of
Directive 2008/56/EC (2), taking into account the Commission Decision (EU) 2017/848 in relation to the relevant
criteria and methodological standards for those descriptors.
(1)For activities in third countries, in accordance with applicable national law or international standards which pursue equivalent
objectives of good water status and good ecological potential, through equivalent procedural and substantive rules, i.e. a water use and
protection management plan developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders which ensures that (1) the impact of the activities
on the identified status or ecological potential of potentially affected water body or bodies is assessed; and (2) deterioration or
prevention of good status/ecological potential is avoided; or, where this is not possible, (3) justified by the lack of better environmental alternatives which are not disproportionately costly/technically unfeasible, and all practicable steps are taken to mitigate the adverse impact on the status of the body of water.
(2)The definition laid down in point 5 of Article 3 of Directive 2008/56/EC provides in particular that good environmental status is to be
determined on the basis of the qualitative descriptors laid down in Annex I to that Directive.OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
