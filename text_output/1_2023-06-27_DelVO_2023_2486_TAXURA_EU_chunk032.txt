ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 20/164For activities in third countries, the programme is reviewed at least once per programming period and in any case every 10
years. The programme adheres to and aligns with the prevailing legal and regulatory provisions, being clear on where legal
responsibilities and liabilities lie. The programme actively engages local communities and other affected stakeholders.
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)
(1) Climate change mitigation The activity does not involve the degradation of land and marine environment with high
carbon stock (16).
(2) Climate change adaptation The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.
(4) Transition to a circular economyOperators limit waste generation in processes related to construction and demolition and take into account best available techniques. At least 70 % (by weight) of the non-
hazardous construction and demolition waste (excluding naturally occurring material
referred to in category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by Decision
2000/532/EC) generated on the construction site is prepared for reuse, recycling and
other material recovery, including backfilling operations using waste to substitute
other materials, in accordance with the waste hierarchy and the EU Construction and
Demolition Waste Management Protocol (
17). Operators use selective demolition to
enable removal and safe handling of hazardous substances and facilitate reuse and
high-quality recycling.
(5) Pollution prevention and
controlThe use of pesticides is minimised and alternative approaches or techniques, which may include non-chemical alternatives to pesticides, are favoured, in accordance with
Directive 2009/128/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (
