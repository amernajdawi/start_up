ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 99/284(b) include purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat, and cooling consumed by the undertaking;
(c) avoid double counting of GHG emissions reported under Scope 1 or 3;
(d) apply the location-based and market-based methods to calculate Scope 2 GHG emissions and provide
information on the share and types of contractual instruments. Location-based method quantifies Scope 2
GHG emissions based on average energy generation emission factors for defined locations, including local,
subnational, or national boundaries (GHG Protocol, “Scope 2 Guidance”, Glossary, 2015). Market-based method quantifies Scope 2 GHG emissions based on GHG emissions emitted by the generators from which
the reporting entity contractually purchases electricity bundled with instruments, or unbundled instruments
on their own (GHG Protocol, “Scope 2 Guidance”, Glossary, 2015); in this case, the undertaking may disclose
the share of market-based scope 2 GHG emissions linked to purchased electricity bundled with instruments
such as Guarantee of Origins or Renewable Energy Certificates. The undertaking shall provide information
about the share and types of contractual instruments used for the sale and purchase of energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation or for unbundled energy attribute claims.
(e) disclose biogenic emissions of CO2 carbon from the combustion or biodegradation of biomass separately
from the Scope 2 GHG emissions but include emissions of other types of GHG (in particular CH4 and N2O).
In case the emission factors applied do not separate the percentage of biomass or biogenic CO2, the
undertaking shall disclose this. In case GHG emissions other than CO2 (particularly CH4 and N2O) are not
available for, or excluded from, location-based grid average emissions factors or with the market-based
method information, the undertaking shall disclose this.
(f) not include any removals, or any purchased, sold or transferred carbon credits or GHG allowances in the
calculation of Scope 2 GHG emissions.
AR 46. When preparing the information on gross Scope 3 GHG emissions required under paragraph 51, the undertaking
shall:
(a) consider the principles and provisions of the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and
Reporting Standard (Version 2011); and it may consider Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279 or
the relevant requirements for the quantification of indirect GHG emissions from EN ISO 14064-1:2018;
(b) if it is a financial institution, consider the GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry
from the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financial (PCAF), specifically part A “Financed Emissions”
(version December 2022);
(c) screen its total Scope 3 GHG emissions based on the 15 Scope 3 categories identified by the GHG Protocol
Corporate Standard and GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (Version 2011) using appropriate estimates. Alternatively, it may screen its indirect GHG emissions based on
the categories provided by EN ISO 14064-1:2018 clause 5.2.4 (excluding indirect GHG emissions from imported energy);
(d) identify and disclose its significant Scope 3 categories based on the magnitude of their estimated GHG
emissions and other criteria provided by GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and
Reporting Standard (Version 2011, p. 61 and 65-68) or EN ISO 14064-1:2018 Annex H.3.2, such as
financial spend, influence, related transition risks and opportunities or stakeholder views;
(e) calculate or estimate GHG emissions in significant Scope 3 categories using suitable emissions factors;
(f) update Scope 3 GHG emissions in each significant category every year on the basis of current activity data;
update the full Scope 3 GHG inventory at least every 3 years or on the occurrence of a significant event or a
significant change in circumstances (a significant event or significant change in circumstances can, for
example, relate to changes in the undertaking’s activities or structure, changes in the activities or structure of
its upstream and downstream value chain(s), a change in calculation methodology or in the discovery of
