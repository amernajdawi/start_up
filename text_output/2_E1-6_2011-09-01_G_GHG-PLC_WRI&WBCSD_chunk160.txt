CHAPTER 13 Reporting
guidanceIt is important to recognize that public disclosure does
not mean there is one homogenous audience with a
uniform set of requirements. Table 13.1  lists distinct 
audiences for a product GHG inventory report, and
identifies how the reporting requirements can help
address their needs. This is not an inclusive list as other
audiences not identified here may still find value in
reports produced following the reporting requirements
in the Product Standard .
13.3.3 Disclaimer
Providing a disclaimer ensures that readers understand the
scope and intended purpose of the inventory results and
are aware of any limitations. (See box 13.1 for an example.)
13.3.4 Use of results
The audience of the public report may be most
interested in what the company is doing, or plans to
do, to reduce the GHG emissions associated with the
product as a result of the inventory. Additionally, the The results presented in this report are unique to the
assumptions and practices of company X. The results
are not meant as a platform for comparability to other
companies and/or products. Even for similar products,
differences in unit of analysis, use and end-of-life stage
profiles, and data quality may produce incomparable
results. The reader may refer to the GHG Protocol
Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard
(www.ghgprotocol.org ) for a glossary and additional
insight into the GHG inventory process. Box [13.1] Example disclaimer
