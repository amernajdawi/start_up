(b) the infrastructure and installations are dedicated to transhipping freight between the modes: terminal infra ­
structure and superstructures for loading, unloading and transhipment of goods;
(c) the infrastructure and installations are dedicated to urban and suburban public passenger transport, including
associated signalling systems for metro, tram and rail systems.
2. The infrastructure is not dedicated to the transport or storage of fossil fuels.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  At least 70 % (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and 
demolition waste (excluding naturally occurring material defined in
category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by
Decision 2000/532/EC) generated on the construction site is prepared
for reuse, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling oper ­
ations using waste to substitute other materials, in accordance with the
waste hierarchy and the EU Construction and Demolition Waste
Management Protocol (  278  ). Operators limit waste generation in processes 
related construction and demolition, in accordance with the EU
Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol and taking
into account best available techniques and using selective demolition to
enable removal and safe handling of hazardous substances and facilitate
reuse and high-quality recycling by selective removal of materials, using
available sorting systems for construction and demolition waste.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Where relevant, noise and vibrations from use of infrastructure are 
mitigated by introducing open trenches, wall barriers or other measures
and comply with Directive 2002/49/EC.
Measures are taken to reduce noise, dust and pollutant emissions during
construction or maintenance works.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.
Where relevant, maintenance of vegetation along road transport infra ­
structure ensures that invasive species do not spread.
Mitigation measures have been implemented to avoid wildlife collisions.  
6.16.  Infrastructure enabling low carbon water transport  
Description of the activity  
Construction, modernisation, operation and maintenance of infrastructure that is required for zero tailpipe CO  2 
operation of vessels or the port’s own operations, as well as infrastructure dedicated to transshipment.
