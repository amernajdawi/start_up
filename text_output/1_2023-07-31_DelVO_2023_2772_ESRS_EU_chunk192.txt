AR 69. For calculating the information required by paragraph 63(a), the undertaking shall identify in which European
Economic Area (EEA) countries it has significant employment (i.e., at least 50 employees representing at least
10% of its total employees). For these countries it shall report the percentage of employees in that country which
are employed in establishments in which employees are represented by workers’ representatives. Establishment is
defined as any place of operations where the undertaking carries out a non-transitory economic activity with
human means and goods. Examples include: a factory, a branch of a retail chain, or an undertaking’s
headquarters. For countries in which there is only one establishment the percentage reported shall be either
100% or 0%.

AR 71. In preparing the disclosure on gender at top management, the undertaking shall use the definition of top
management as one and two levels below the administrative and supervisory bodies unless this concept has

case, the undertaking can use its own definition for top management and disclose that fact and its own definition.

AR 72. The lowest wage shall be calculated for the lowest pay category, excluding interns and apprentices. This is to be
based on the basic wage plus any fixed additional payments that are guaranteed to all employees. The lowest
wage shall be considered separately for each country in which the undertaking has operations, except outside the
EEA when the relevant adequate or minimum wage is defined at a sub national level.
AR 73. The adequate wage benchmark used for comparison with the lowest wage shall not be lower than:
(a) in the EEA: the minimum wage set in accordance with Directive (EU) 2022/2041 of the European Parliament and of the Council (

(EU) 2022/2041 enters into application, where there is no applicable minimum wage determined by
legislation or collective bargaining in an EEA country, the undertaking shall use an adequate wage
(103)Directive (EU) 2022/2041 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October 2022 on adequate minimum wages in the
European Union (OJ L 275, 25.10.2022, p. 33).OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
