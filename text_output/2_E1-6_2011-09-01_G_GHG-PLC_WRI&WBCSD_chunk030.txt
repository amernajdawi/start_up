[40]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard
 [40]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard
guidanceand duration of attributable processes in the use stage
depends heavily on the function and service life of the
product. For products that consume energy to fulfill their
function, attributable processes in the use stage and their
corresponding emissions may account for the largest
fraction of impacts over the complete life cycle. Examples
of attributable processes may include:
•Transportation to the use location (e.g., consumers
driving to their residences)
•Refrigeration at the use location
•Preparation for use (e.g., microwaving)
•Use (e.g., power consumption)
•Repair and maintenance occurring during usage time3
End-of-life
The end-of-life stage begins when the used product is
discarded by the consumer and ends when the product
is returned to nature (e.g., incinerated) or allocated to
another product’s life cycle (e.g., recycled). Because
the main attributable process in the end-of-life stage
is the method used to treat the product (land filling,
incineration, etc.), companies need to know or assume
the fate of the product to map this stage. Examples of
attributable processes may include:
•Collection and transport of end-of-life products and
packages
•Waste management
•Dismantling of components
•Shredding and sorting •Incineration and sorting of bottom ash
•Land filling and landfill maintenance
Requirements and guidance for end-of-life recycling are
available in chapter 9.  
For a service, the production and use stage may be
combined into the service delivery stage. This stage
encompasses all operations required to complete a
service. For example, in the case of home appliance repair,
attributable processes may include driving to the home,
assessing the appliance, ordering or picking up parts, and
returning to complete the final repair. All material flows
(e.g., parts needed for the repair), energy flows (e.g., fuel
to deliver the service person and/or parts), and end-of-
life considerations of materials and wastes make up the
attributable processes along the service life cycle.
7.3.2 Developing a process map
Developing a process map is an important requirement
when completing an inventory, since processes and
flows identified in the process map are the basis for
data collection and calculation. Companies may use the
following steps:
1. Identify the defined life cycle stages at the top of the
map, from material extraction through to end-of-life
(or production for cradle-to-gate inventories)
2. Identify the position on the map where the studied product
is finished, and exits the reporting company’s gate
