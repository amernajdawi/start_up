(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  For installations falling within the scope of Directive 2010/75/EU, 
emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with
the best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the latest
relevant best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including the best
available techniques (BAT) conclusions for large combustion plants (  196  ), 
ensuring at the same time that no significant cross-media effects occur.
For combustion plants with thermal input greater than 1 MW but below
the thresholds for the BAT conclusions for large combustion plants to
apply, emissions are below the emission limit values set out in Annex II,
part 2, to Directive (EU) 2015/2193.
For plants in zones or parts of zones not complying with the air quality
limit values laid down in Directive 2008/50/EC, results of the information
exchange (  197  ), which are published by the Commission in accordance with 
Article 6, paragraphs 9 and 10, of Directive (EU) 2015/2193 are taken
into account.
In case of anaerobic digestion of organic material, where the produced
digestate is used as fertiliser or soil improver, either directly or after
composting or any other treatment, it meets the requirements for ferti ­
lising materials set out in Component Material Categories (CMC) 4 and 5
in Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 or national rules on fertilisers
or soil improvers for agricultural use.
For anaerobic digestion plants treating over 100 tonnes per day, emissions
to air and water are within or lower than the emission levels associated
with the best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set for anaerobic
treatment of waste in the latest relevant best available techniques (BAT)
conclusions, including the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for
waste treatment (  198  ). No significant cross-media effects occur.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
4.21.  Production of heat/cool from solar thermal heating  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of facilities producing heat/cool from solar thermal heating technology.  
Where an economic activity is an integral element of the ‘Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy
technologies’ as referred to in Section 7.6 of this Annex, the technical screening criteria specified in Section 7.6
apply.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code D35.30 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
___________  
( 196  ) Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/1442.  
( 197  ) The final technology report resulting from the exchange of information with Member States, the industries concerned and non- 
governmental organisations contains technical information on best available technologies used in medium combustion plants to
reduce their environmental impacts, and on the emission levels achievable with best available and emerging technologies and the  
related costs (version of 4.6.2021: https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/06f33a94-9829-4eee-b187-21bb783a0fbf/library/9a99a632-
