superior undertaken with the knowledge of the employee at least once per year. The review can include an
evaluation by the workerâ€™s direct superior, peers, or a wider range of employees. The review can also involve the
human resources department. In order to disclose the information required by paragraph 83 (a), the undertaking
shall use the employee headcount figures provided in Disclosure Requirement ESRS S1-6 in the denominator to
calculate the:

(b) number of reviews in proportion to the agreed number of reviews by the management.
AR 78. To disclose the average required per paragraph 83 (b), the undertaking shall perform the following calculation:

number of employees per gender category. For the total training average and the average by gender, the head
count figures for total employment and employment by gender reported in Disclosure Requirement ESRS S1-6
shall be used.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
