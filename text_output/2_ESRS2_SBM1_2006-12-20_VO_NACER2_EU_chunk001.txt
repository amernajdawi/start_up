nity, and in particular Article 285(1) thereof,

structural changes of the economy, an up-to-date classifica-
tion, called NACE Revision 2, should be established(hereinafter referred to as ‘NACE Rev. 2’).

to the Commission's ongoing efforts to modernise the
production of Community statistics; it is expected tocontribute, through more comparable and relevant data, tobetter economic governance at both Community andnational level.

standards applicable to the collection, transmission and
publication of national and Community statistics so thatbusinesses, financial institutions, governments and all otheroperators in the internal market can have access to reliableand comparable statistical data. To this end, it is vital thatthe various categories for classifying activities in theCommunity be interpreted uniformly in all the Member
States.

businesses to assess their competitiveness, and are useful to
the Community institutions in preventing distortions ofcompetition.

cation of economic activities does not oblige Member States
to collect, publish or supply data. Only if the Member Statesuse activity classifications linked to the Communityclassification is it possible to provide integrated informationwith the reliability, speed, flexibility and degree of detailrequired for the management of the internal market.
(7) Provision should be made for the Member States to be able,
in order to meet national requirements, to integrate into
their national classifications additional categories based onthe statistical classification of economic activities in theCommunity.

requires that the Member States and the Community
institutions use classifications of economic activities whichare directly linked to the International Standard IndustrialClassification of all economic activities (ISIC) Rev. 4, asadopted by the Statistical Commission of the UnitedNations.
