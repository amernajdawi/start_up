ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 149/284AR 25. The targets related to the potentially material sustainability matters listed in paragraph AR 4 of this Standard, may
be presented in a table as illustrated below:
Type of target
according to
sustainability matterBaseline value and
base yearTarget value and geographical scopeConnected policy or legislation if relevant2025 2030 Up to 2050
AR 26. Measurable targets related to biodiversity and ecosystems may be expressed as:
(a) size and location of all habitat areas protected or restored, whether directly or indirectly controlled by the
undertaking, and whether the success of the restoration measure was or is approved by independent external
professionals;
(b) recreated surfaces (environments in which management initiatives are implemented so as to create a habitat on
a site where it did not exist initially); or
(c) number or percentage of projects / sites whose ecological integrity was improved (e.g., installation of fish
passes, wildlife corridors).
Disclosure Requirement E4-5 â€“ Impact metrics related to biodiversity and ecosystems change
AR 27. When preparing the information required under this Disclosure Requirement, the undertaking shall consider and
may describe:
(a) the methodologies and metrics used and an explanation for why these methodologies and metrics are selected,
as well as their assumptions, limitations and uncertainties, and any changes in methodologies made over time
and why they occurred;
(b) the scope of the metrics and methodologies, for example:
i.undertaking, site, brand, commodity, corporate business unit, activity;
ii.aspects (as set out in paragraph AR 4) covered.
(c) the biodiversity components of the metrics: species specific, ecosystem specific;
(d) the geographies covered by the methodology and an explanation of why any relevant geographies were omitted;
(e) how the metrics integrate ecological thresholds (e.g., the biosphere integrity and land-system change,
planetary boundaries) and allocations;
(f) the frequency of monitoring, key metrics being monitored, and the baseline condition/value and
baseline year/period, as well as the reference period;
(g) whether these metrics rely on primary data, secondary data, modelled data or on expert judgement, or a mixture of these;
(h) an indication of which action is measured and monitored via the metrics and how they relate to the
achievement of targets;
(i) whether metrics are mandatory (required by legislation) or voluntary. If they are mandatory, the undertaking
may indicate the relevant legislation; if voluntary, the undertaking may refer to any voluntary standard or
procedure used; and
(j) whether the metrics are informed by or correspond to expectations or recommendations of relevant and
authoritative national, EU-level or intergovernmental guidelines, policies, legislation or agreements, such as
the Convention for Biological Diversity (CBD) or IPBES.
AR 28. The undertaking shall disclose metrics that are verifiable and that are technically and scientifically robust
considering the appropriate time scales geographies, and may disclose how its selected metrics correspond to
those criteria. To ensure that the metric is relevant there should be a clear relationship between the indicator and
the purpose of the measurement. Uncertainties should be reduced as far as possible. Data or mechanisms used
should be supported by well-established organisations and updated over time. Robust modelled data and expert OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
