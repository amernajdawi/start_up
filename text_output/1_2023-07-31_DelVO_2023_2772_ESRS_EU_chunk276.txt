ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 276/284Recovery Any operation the principal result of which is waste serving a useful purpose
by replacing other materials which would otherwise have been used to fulfil
a particular function, or waste being prepared to fulfil that function, in the
plant or in the wider economy (25).
Recycling Any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into
products, materials or substances whether for the original or other
purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material but does not
include energy recovery and the reprocessing into materials that are to be
used as fuels or for backfilling operations.
Resource regeneration Promotion of self-renewal capacity of natural systems with the aim of
reactivating ecological processes damaged or over-exploited by human
action.
Remedy/remediation To counteract or make good a negative impact. Examples: apologies,
financial or non-financial compensation, prevention of harm through
injunctions or guarantees of non-repetition, punitive sanctions (whether
criminal or administrative, such as fines), restitution, restoration,
rehabilitation.
Renewable energy Energy from renewable non-fossil sources, namely wind, solar (solar
thermal and solar photovoltaic) and geothermal energy, ambient energy,
tide, wave and other ocean energy, hydropower, biomass, landfill gas,
sewage treatment plant gas, and biogas (26).
Renewable materials Materials that are derived from resources that are quickly replenished by
ecological cycles or agricultural processes, so that the services provided by
these and other linked resources are not endangered and remain available for
the next generation.
Resource inflows Resource that enters the undertaking’s facilities.
Resource outflows Resource that leaves the undertaking’s facilities.
Resource use optimisation The design, production and distribution of materials and products with the
objective to keep them in use at their highest value. Eco-design and design
for longevity , repair, reuse, repurposing, disassembly, remanufacturing are
examples of tools to optimise resource use.
Reuse Any operation by which products and components that are not waste are
used again for the same purpose for which they were conceived. This may
involve cleaning or small adjustments so it is ready for the next use without
significant modification.
River basin The area of land from which all surface run-off flows through a sequence of
streams, rivers and, possibly, lakes into the sea at a single river mouth,
estuary or delta.
Risks Sustainability-related risks with negative financial effects arising from
environmental, social or governance matters that may negatively affect the undertaking's financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to
finance or cost of capital in the short, medium or long term.
