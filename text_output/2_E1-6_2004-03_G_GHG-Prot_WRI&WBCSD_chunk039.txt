Office-Based OrganizationsCalculates direct and indirect CO2emissions from fuel combustion in stationary equipment
Provides two options for allocating GHG emissions from a co-generation facility
Provides default fuel and national average electricity emission factors
Calculates direct and indirect CO2emissions from fuel combustion in mobile sources
Provides calculations and emission factors for road, air, water, and rail transport
Calculates direct HFC emissions during manufacture, use and disposal of refrigeration and air-
conditioning equipment in commercial applications
Provides three calculation methodologies: a sales-based approach, a life cycle stage based
approach, and an emission factor based approach
Introduces the fundamentals of uncertainty analysis and quantification
Calculates statistical parameter uncertainties due to random errors related to calculation of
GHG emissions
Automates the aggregation steps involved in developing a basic uncertainty assessment for GHG
inventory data
Calculates direct GHG emissions from aluminum production (CO2from anode oxidation, PFC emis-
sions from the “anode effect,” and SF6used in non-ferrous metals production as a cover gas)
Calculates direct GHG emissions (CO2) from oxidation of the reducing agent, from the calcination
of the flux used in steel production, and from the removal of carbon from the iron ore and scrapsteel used
Calculates direct GHG emissions (N
2O) from the production of nitric acid
Calculates direct GHG emissions (CO2) from ammonia production. This is for the removal of
carbon from the feedstock stream only; combustion emissions are calculated with the stationarycombustion module
Calculates direct GHG emissions (N
2O) from adipic acid production
Calculates direct CO2emissions from the calcination process in cement manufacturing (WBCSD
tool also calculates combustion emissions)
Provides two calculation methodologies: the cement-based approach and the clinker-based approach
Calculates direct GHG emissions from lime manufacturing (CO2from the calcination process)
Calculates direct HFC-23 emissions from production of HCFC-22
Calculates direct CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from production of pulp and paper. This includes
calculation of direct and indirect CO2emissions from combustion of fossil fuels, bio-fuels, and
waste products in stationary equipment
Calculates PFC emission from the production of semi-conductor wafers
Calculates direct CO2emissions from fuel use, indirect CO2emissions from electricity
consumption, and other indirect CO2emissions from business travel and commutingTABLE 3.  Overview of GHG calculation tools available on the GHG Protocol website CROSS-SECTOR TOOLSCALCULATION TOOLS MAIN FEATURES .SECTOR-SPECIFIC TOOLS
