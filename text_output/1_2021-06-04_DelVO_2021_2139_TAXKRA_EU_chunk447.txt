GENERIC CRITERIA FOR DNSH TO PROTECTION AND RESTORATION OF BIODIVERSITY AND
ECOSYSTEMS  
An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or screening (  1 ) has been completed in accordance with Directive 
2011/92/EU (  2 ). 
Where an EIA has been carried out, the required mitigation and compensation measures for protecting the
environment are implemented.  
For sites/operations located in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected
areas, UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas, as well as other protected areas), an appropriate
assessment (  3 ), where applicable, has been conducted and based on its conclusions the necessary mitigation 
measures (  4 ) are implemented.EN  9.12.2021 Official Journal of the European Union L 442/349  
( 1 ) The procedure through which the competent authority determines whether projects listed in Annex II to Directive 2011/92/EU is  to 
be made subject to an environmental impact assessment (as referred to in Article 4(2) of that Directive).  
( 2 ) For activities in third countries, in accordance with equivalent applicable national law or international standards requiring  the 
completion of an EIA or screening, for example, IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental
and Social Risks.  
( 3 ) In accordance with Directives 2009/147/EC and 92/43/EEC. For activities located in third countries, in accordance with equiva lent
applicable national law or international standards, that aim at the conservation of natural habitats, wild fauna and wild flora , and that
require to carry out (1) a screening procedure to determine whether, for a given activity, an appropriate assessment of the pos sible
impacts on protected habitats and species is needed; (2) such an appropriate assessment where the screening determines that it is
needed, for example IFC Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resource s.
( 4 ) Those measures have been identified to ensure that the project, plan or activity will not have any significant effects on the  
conservation objectives of the protected area.
