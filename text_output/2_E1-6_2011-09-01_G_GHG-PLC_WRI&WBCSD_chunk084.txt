14.1 Introduction
This standard is designed to help improve the quality and consistency of product
inventories and public reporting with the ultimate goal of helping companies and
other stakeholders reduce emissions of the products they design, manufacture, sell,
purchase, and use. This step in the inventory process allows companies to set and meet
reduction targets by consistently and accurately tracking inventory changes and identifying
reduction opportunities.
14.2 Requirements
Companies can publicly report a GHG inventory in
conformance with the Product Standard  without setting a 
reduction target and tracking inventory changes. However,
companies that do set reduction targets and track
inventory changes shall abide by these requirements. To set reduction targets and track inventory changes over time, companies  shall:
• Develop and report a base inventory that
conforms with the requirements of this
standard;
 • Recalculate the base inventory when  
significant changes in the inventory
methodology occur and report those
changes;  • Complete and disclose an updated 
inventory report including the updated
results, the base inventory results, and
the context for significant changes; and
 • Use a consistent unit of analysis to  enable 
comparison and track performance over time.

14.3 Guidance
14.3.1  Steps for setting reduction targets and 
tracking changes
Setting reduction targets and tracking changes involves
the following steps:
1. Complete and report a base inventory done in
conformance with the requirements of this standard.
2. Identify reduction opportunities.
3. Set a reduction target.
4. Achieve reductions and account for these by
performing an updated inventory.
5. Recalculate the base inventory as needed when
significant changes in the inventory occur, including,
but not limited to: changes in the product’s boundary;
quality of data; and allocation or recycling methods.6. Complete and disclose an updated inventory report
including the updated results and the base inventory
results. Companies should report the inventory results
as a percentage change over time on the unit of
analysis basis.
The following section describes each step in more detail.
Step 1:  Complete and report a base inventory
The first step is to ensure that a base inventory has been
completed and publically reported in conformance with
this standard. The base inventory does not have to be
the first inventory a company performs on a product; for
example, companies may want to improve data quality
before finalizing the base inventory. Once a company has
identified the base inventory, however, any changes made
that warrant a recalculation should be done following the
guidance in step 5.
