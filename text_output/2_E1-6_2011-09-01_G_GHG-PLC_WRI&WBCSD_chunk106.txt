Glossary
Allocation  The partitioning of emissions and removals from a common process between the studied 
product’s life cycle and the life cycle of the co-product(s).1
Assurance  The level of confidence that the inventory results and report are complete, accurate, 
consistent, transparent, relevant, and without material misstatements.
Assurer  A competent individual or body who conducts the assurance process, whether internally 
within the company or externally.
Attributable processes  Service, material, and energy flows that become the product, make the product, and 
carry the product through its life cycle.
Attributional approach   An approach to LCA where GHG emissions and removals are attributed to the unit of analysis 
of the studied product by linking together attributable processes along its life cycle.2
Audit trail  Well organized and transparent historical records documenting how the GHG inventory 
was compiled.
Biogenic  Produced by living organisms or biological processes, but not fossilized or from  
fossil sources.3
Carbon stock  The total amount of carbon stored on a plot of land at any given time in one or more of 
the following carbon pools: biomass (above and below ground), dead organic matter
(dead wood and litter), and soil organic matter.4  A change in carbon stock can refer to 
additional carbon storage within a pool, the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, or the
emission of CO2 to the atmosphere.
Common process  One process that has multiple valuable products as inputs and/or outputs including the 
studied product and co-product(s).
Comparative assertion  An environmental claim regarding the superiority or equivalence of one product versus a 
competing product that performs the same function.5
Consequential approach  An approach to LCA where processes are included in the life cycle boundary to the extent 
that they are expected to change as a consequence of a change in demand for the unit
of analysis.6
Consumer  An individual that purchases and uses a product.
Co-product  A product exiting the common process that has value as an input into another product’s 
life cycle.
