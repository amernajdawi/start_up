(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  The activity assesses availability of and, where feasible, uses equipment and 
components of high durability and recyclability and that are easy to
dismantle and refurbish.
A waste management plan is in place and ensures maximal reuse, remanu ­
facturing or recycling at end of life, including through contractual
agreements with waste management partners, reflection in financial
projections or official project documentation.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  For air to air heat pumps with rated capacity of 12kW or below, indoor 
and outdoor sound power levels are below the threshold set out in Regu ­
lation (EU) No 206/2012.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  N/A  
4.17.  Cogeneration of heat/cool and power from solar energy  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of a facility co-generating electricity and heat/cool from solar energy.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular D35.11 and
D35.30 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.
The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan,
such that:
(a) for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using
climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale;
