ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/825/oj 1/16DIRECTIVE (EU) 2024/825 OF THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 28 Febr uary 2024 amending Directiv es 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU as regards empo wering consumers for the green transition through better protection against unfair practices and through better information (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUR OPEAN UNION, Havi ng regar d to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof, Havi ng regar d to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draf t legislative act to the national parliaments, Havi ng regar d to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1), Acting in accordance with the ordinar y legislative procedure (2), Whereas: (1) In order to contr ibute to the proper functioning of the internal mark et, based on a high level of consumer prot ection and environmental prote ction, and to make progress in the green transition, it is essential that consumers can make informed purchas ing decisions and thus contr ibute to more sustainable consum ption patter ns. That implies that traders have a responsibility to provide clear , relevant and reliable information. Theref ore, specifi c rules should be introduced in Union consumer law to tackle unfai r commercial practices that mislead consumers and prevent them from making sustainable consump tion choices, such as practices associated with the early obsolescence of goods, misleading environmental claims (‘greenwashing’), misleading information about the social charact eristics of products or traders’ businesses, or non-transparent and non-credible sustainability labels. Those rules will enable compet ent national bodies to effectively address such practices. Ensur ing that environmental claims are fair, understandable and reliable will allow traders to operate on a level playing field and will enable consumers to choose products that are genuinely bette r for the environment than compet ing products. This will encourage competition leading to more envi ronmentally sustainable products, thereby reducing the negative impact on the environment. (2) Those new rules should be introduced through amending Articles 6 and 7 of Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3)with regar d to commercial practices that are considered to be misleading, and theref ore prohibit ed, on the basis of a case-by-case assessment, and through amending Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC, with the addition of specific misleading practices which are in all circumstances considered unfai r, and theref ore prohibit ed. As already laid down in Directive 2005/29/EC, it should still be possible to consider that a commercial practice is unfair on the basis of Articles 5 to 9 of that Directive, even though that particular practice is not liste d as an unfai r commercial practice in Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC. (3) In order for consumers to be empo wered to take bette r-informed decisions and thus stimulate the demand for, and the supply of, more sustainable goods, they should not be misled about a product’ s environmental or social character istics or circular ity aspects, such as durability , reparability or recy clability , through the overall presentation of a product. Article 6(1) of Directive 2005/29/EC should theref ore be amended by adding environmental and social (1)OJ C 443, 22.11.2022, p. 75. (2)Position of the European Parliament of 17 Januar y 2024 (not yet published in the Official Jour nal) and decision of the Council of 20 Febr uary 2024. (3)Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concer ning unfair business-to-co nsumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (‘Unf air Commercial Practices Directive’) (OJ L 149, 11.6.2005, p. 22).

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/825/oj 2/16character istics and circular ity aspects to the list of the main charact eristics of a product in respect of whic h a trader ’s practices can be considered misleading, follo wing a case-by- case assessment. Information provided by traders on the social character istics of a product throughout its value chain can relat e, for example, to the quality and fairness of working conditions of the workf orce involved, such as adequat e wages, social protection, the safety of the work environment and social dialogue. Such information can also relat e to respect for human rights, to equal treatment and oppor tunities for all, including gender equality , inclusion and diversity , to contr ibutions to social initiatives or to ethical commitments, such as animal welfare. The envi ronmental and social character istics of a product can be underst ood in a broad sense, encompassing the environmental and social aspects, impa ct and performa nce of a product. (4) Envi ronmental claims, in particular climat e-relat ed claims, increasing ly relate to future performa nce in the form of a transition to carbon or climat e neutrality , or a similar objective, by a certain date. Through such claims, traders creat e the impression that consumers contr ibute to a low-car bon econom y by purc hasing their products. To ensure the fairness and credibility of such claims, Article 6(2) of Directive 2005/29/EC should be amended to prohibit such claims, following a case-by-case assessment, where they are not suppor ted by clear , objective, publicly available and verifiable commitments and targets given by the trader and set out in a detailed and realistic implementation plan that shows how those commitments and targets will be achieved and that allocat es resources to that end. That imp lementation plan should include all the relevant elements necessar y to fulfil the commitments, such as budgetary resources and technological developments, where appropr iate and in accordance with Union law. Such claims should also be verified by a third party exper t, who should be independent from the trader , free from any conf licts of interest, with exper ience and compet ence in environmental issues and who should be able to monitor the progress of the trader regularly with regar d to the commitments and targe ts, including the milestones for achi eving them. Traders should ensure that the regular findings of the third party exper t are available to consumers. (5) Another poten tially misleading commercial practice to be added to the specifi c practices referred to in Article 6(2) of Directive 2005/29/EC is adver tising benefi ts to consumers that are irrelevant and not directly related to any feature of that specifi c product or business and whic h could mislead consumers into believing that they are more beneficial to consumers, the environment or society than other products or traders’ businesses of the same type, for example, claiming that a particular brand of bottled water is gluten-free or claiming that paper sheets do not contain plastic. (6) Com paring products based on their environmental or social characteri stics or circular ity aspects, such as durability , reparability or recy clability , is an increasing ly common mark eting technique that could mislead consumers, who are not alwa ys able to assess the reliability of that information. In order to ensure that such comparisons do not mislead consumers, Article 7 of Directive 2005/29/EC should be amended to require traders to provid e consumers with information about the method of comparison, the products which are the object of comparison and the suppliers of those products, and the measures to keep information up to date . This should ensure that consumers make bette r-informed transactional decisions when relying on such compar isons. It should be ensured that such compari sons are objective by, in particular , comparing products which serve the same function, using a common method and common assump tions, and compar ing mat erial and verifiable features of the products being compare d. (7) Sustainability labels can relate to man y charact eristics of a product, process or business, and it is essential to ensure their transparency and credibility . Theref ore, the displa ying of sustainability labels which are not based on a certification sche me, or which have not been established by public author ities should be prohibit ed by including such practices in the list in Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC. Before displa ying a sustainability label, the trader should ensure that, according to the publicly available term s of the certification scheme, it meets minimum conditions of transparency and credibility , including the existen ce of objective monitori ng of compl iance with the requirements of the scheme. Such monitoring should be carried out by a third party whose compet ence and independence from both the scheme owner and the trader are ensured based on intern ational, Union or national standards and procedures, for example by demonstrating compl iance with relevant international standards, such as ISO 17065 ‘Conf ormity assessment – Requirements for bodies certifying products, processes and services ’ or OJ L, 6.3.2024 EN

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/825/oj 3/16through the mechanis ms provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). The displa ying of sustainability labels remains possible without a certification sche me when such labels are established by a public author ity, or where additional forms of expression and presentation of food are used in accordance with Article 35 of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). Examples of sustainability labels established by public author ities are logos award ed when compl ying with the requirements of Regulations (EC) No 1221/2009 (6)or (EC) No 66/2010 (7)of the European Parliament and of the Council. Some certificat ion marks, as defined in Article 27 of Directive (EU) 2015/2436 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), can also operat e as sustainability labels if they promote a product, process or business with reference, for example, to its environmental or social charact eristics or both. The trader should be able to displa y such certification marks only if they are established by public author ities or based on a certificat ion schem e. That rule complements Annex I, point (4), to Directive 2005/29/EC, whic h prohibits the making of a claim that a trader , the commercial practices of a trader or a product have been approved, endorsed or author ised by a public or private body when that is not the case, or the making of such a claim without compl ying with the term s of the appro val, endorsement or author isation. Voluntar y market-based standards and voluntary public standards for green and sustainable bonds do not primar ily target retail invest ors and are subject to specific laws. For those reasons, those standards should not be considered to be sustainability labels under this Directive. It is important that public author ities, as far as possible and in compl iance with Union law, promote measures to facilitat e access to sustainability labels for small and medium-sized enterprises. (8) In cases where the displa ying of a sustainability label involves a commercial communication that sugge sts or creat es the imp ression that a product has a positive or zero impact on the environment, or is less damaging to the environment than compe ting products, that sustainability label should also be considered as constituting an environmental claim. (9) Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC should also be amended to prohibit the making of a generic environmental claim without recognised exce llent envi ronmental perf ormance whic h is relevant to the claim. Examples of gener ic environmental claims include ‘environmentally friendly’ , ‘eco-fr iendly’, ‘green’, ‘nature ’s friend’, ‘ecological’, ‘envir onmentally correct’, ‘climate friendly’, ‘gentle on the envi ronment ’, ‘carbon friendly’ , ‘ energy efficient ’, ‘biodegradable’, ‘biobased’ or similar state ments that sugges t or creat e the impression of excellent envi ronmental performa nce. Such gener ic environmental claims should be prohibit ed when recognised excellen t environmental performa nce cannot be demonstrate d. Whenever the specification of the environmental claim is provid ed in clear and prominent term s on the same medium, such as the same adver tising spot, the product’ s packag ing or online selling interf ace, the environmental claim is not considered to be a gener ic environmental claim. For exam ple, the claim ‘climat e-friendly packag ing’ would be a gener ic claim, whilst claiming that ‘100 % of energy used to produce this packag ing comes from renewable sources’ would be a specifi c claim, which would not fall under this prohibition, without prejudice to other provis ions of Directive 2005/29/EC remaining applicable to those specifi c claims. Further more, a claim made in written form or orally combined with implicit claims such as colours or images could constitut e a gener ic envi ronmental claim.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/825/oj 4/16(10) Recognised excellen t environmental performa nce can be demonstrated by compl iance with Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 or with officially recognised EN ISO 14024 ecolabelling schemes in the Member State s, or by corresponding to top environmental perf ormance for a specifi c environmental charact eristic in accordance with other applicable Union laws, such as class A in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9). The recognised excellent envi ronmental performa nce in question should be relevant to the entire claim. For example, a gener ic envi ronmental claim such as ‘energy efficient’ could be made based on recognised excellen t environmental performa nce in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1369. By contrast, a generic environmental claim such as ‘biodegradable ’ could not be made based on recognised excellent environmental performa nce in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 66/2010, insofa r as there are no requirements for biodegradability in the specific EU Ecolabel criteria relat ed to the product in question. Similarly , a trader should not make a gener ic claim such as ‘conscious’, ‘sustainable’ or ‘responsible’ based excl usively on recognised excellent environmental performance, because such claims relat e to other characteri stics in addition to environmental character istics, such as social charact eristics. (11) Another misleading commercial practice, whic h should be prohibit ed in all circumstances and thus added to the list in Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC, is making an environmental claim about the entire product or the trader ’s entire business when it actually concer ns only a certain aspect of the product or a specific, unrepresentative activity of the trader ’s business. That ban would apply , for exam ple, when a product is mark eted as ‘made with recy cled mater ial’ giving the impression that the entire product is made of recy cled mater ial, when in fact only the packaging is made of recy cled mater ial, or when a trader gives the impression that it is only using renewable energy sources when in fact several of the trader ’s business facilities still use fossil fuels. According ly, the ban should not prevent a trader from making environmental claims about its entire business, provided that those claims are accurat e and verifiable and that they do not overstat e the envi ronmental benefi t, such as would be the case in the second of those examples , if that trader were to repor t a decrease in the use of fossil fuels for its business as a whole. (12) It is particularly impor tant to prohibit the making of claims, based on the offsetting of greenhouse gas emissions, that a product, either a good or service has a neutral, reduced, or positive impact on the environment in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. Such claims should be prohibit ed in all circumstances and added to the list in Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC as they mislead consumers by making them believe that such claims relate to the product itself or to the supply and production of that product, or as they give the false impression to consumers that the consum ption of that product does not have an environmental impact. Examples of such claims are ‘climate neutral’ , ‘CO 2 neutral certified’, ‘carbon positive’, ‘climate net zero’, ‘climate compen sated’ , ‘reduced climat e impact’ and ‘limit ed CO 2 footpr int’. Such claims should only be allowed when they are based on the actual lifecy cle impact of the product in question, and not based on the offsetting of greenhouse gas emissions outside the product’ s value chain, as the former and the latter are not equivalent. Such a prohibition should not prevent compan ies from adver tising their investments in environmental initiatives, including carbon credit projects, as long as they provid e such information in a way that is not misleading and that complies with the requirements laid down in Union law. (13) Additional requirements on envi ronmental claims will have to be set in specif ic Union legal acts. Those new requirements will contr ibut e to the objective of the communication of the Commission of 11 December 2019 on The European Green Deal of enabling buye rs to make more sustainable decisions and reduce the risk of greenwashing through reliable, compar able and verifiable information. (14) Marke ting across the Member States of goods as being identical when, in reality , they have a signif icantly differ ent compo sition or signif icantly differ ent charact eristics could mislead consumers and cause them to take a transactional decision that they would not other wise have take n. Such mark eting practices are expressly addressed in Article 6(2), point (c), of Directive 2005/29/EC, introduced by Directive (EU) 2019/2161 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10)that Member State s have had to apply as of 28 May 2022 .

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/825/oj 5/16assess and repor t in 2024 on the application of Directive (EU) 2019/2161, including Article 6(2), point (c), of Directive 2005/29/EC and whether those practices should be subject to more stringent requirements, including prohibition in Annex I. The new provisions against greenwashing practices in this Directive should also apply to such practices where versions of the same product are mark eted as being identical in differ ent Member States despite having signif icant differences as refer red to in Article 6(2), point (c), of Directive 2005/29/EC. (15) Presenting requirements that are impos ed by law on all products within the relevant product categor y on the Union mark et, including impor ted products, as a distinctive feature of the trader ’s offer , should be prohibited in all circumstances and thus added to the list in Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC. This prohibition should apply , for example, where a trader adver tises a given product as not including a specific chemical substance when that substance is already forbidden by law for all products within that product categor y in the Union. Conv ersely , the prohibition should not cover commercial practices promoting traders’ or products’ compl iance with legal requirements that only apply to some products but not to other competing products of the same catego ry on the Union market, such as products of non-U nion origin. It could be the case that certain products on the mark et are required to compl y with certain legal requirements while other products in the same product catego ry are not required to compl y with those requirements. For example, as regar ds fish products produced sustainably in accordance with Union law, it would be allowe d to promote the sustainability charact eristics of those products that compl y with Union lega l requirements, if fish products of third countr y origin offered on the Union mark et are not required to compl y with those Union legal requirements. (16) In order to imp rove the welf are of consumers, the amendments to Directive 2005/29/EC should also address several practices associated with early obsolescence, including planned early obsolescence practices, understood as a commercial policy involving deliberately planning or designing a product with a limite d lifes pan so that it prematurely becomes obsolet e or non-functional after a certain period or after a predete rmined intensity of use. Purchasin g products that are expect ed to last long er than they actually do causes consumer detr iment. Further more, early obsolescence practices have an overall nega tive impact on the environment in the form of increased waste and increased use of energy and mater ials. Theref ore, addressing information related to early obsolescence practices is also likely to reduce the amount of waste, contr ibuting to a more sustainable consum ption. (17) It should also be prohibit ed under Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC to withhold information from consumers about the fact that a software updat e will negatively impact the functioning of goods with digital elements or the use of digital cont ent or digital services. In general, traders responsible for the development of software updates are expecte d to have such information, while in other cases traders can rely on reliable information provided by, for example, software developers, suppliers or compet ent national author ities. For example, when inviti ng consumers to update the operating system on their smar tphone, the trader should not withhold information from the consumer that such an update will negatively impa ct the functioning of any of the features of the smar tphone, such as the batter y, the performance of certain applications or cause a complet e slowdown of the smar tphone. The prohibition should apply to any update, including secur ity and functionality updat es. For updat es, including secur ity update s, that are necessar y to keep the good, digital cont ent and digital service in conf ormity , Article 8 of Directive (EU) 2019/770 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11)and Article 7 of Directive (EU) 2019/771 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12)should also apply . This is without prejudice to Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2019/770. (11)Directive (EU) 2019/770 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 on certain aspects concer ning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services (OJ L 136, 22.5.2019, p. 1). (12)Directive (EU) 2019/771 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 on certain aspects concer ning contracts for the sale of goods, amending Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 and Directive 2009/22/EC, and repealing Directive 1999/44/EC (OJ L 136, 22.5.2019, p. 28).OJ L, 6.3.2024 EN

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/825/oj 6/16(18) Software updat es that are secur ity updat es are necessar y for the secure use of the product while updat es relat ed to enhancing functionality features are not. Theref ore, Directive 2005/29/EC should prohibit the presentation of a software update as necessar y to keep the product in conf ormity where that updat e only enhances functionality features. (19) Commercial communications for goods that contain a feature introduced to limit their durability is a commercial practice that is detr imental to consumers and the environment as they encourage the sale of such goods whic h leads to higher costs for consumers and unnecessar y use of resources, waste production and greenhouse gas emissions. Such commercial communications should theref ore be prohibit ed when information on the feature and its effects on the durability of the good are available to the trader . Examples of such features could be software which stops or down grades the functionality of the good after a particular period, or a piece of hardware which is designed to fail after a particular period. It could also be a design or manufactur ing flaw which , although not introduced as a feature for that purpose, leads to the premature failure of the good, if it is not fixed once information about the existen ce and effect of the feature has become available to the trader . In the conte xt of that prohibition, commercial communications include communications designed to promote, directly or indirectly , the goods. The manufact uring of goods and making them available on the mark et do not constitute commercial communications. That prohibition should aim to cover mainly traders who are also the producers of the goods, as it is they who determi ne the durability of the goods. Theref ore, in general, when a good is identif ied as containing a feature to limit the durability , the producer of that good should be expected to be aware of that feature and its effect on the durability of that good. Never theless, traders who are not the producers of the goods, such as the sellers, should be target ed by that prohibition where reliable information is available to them about the feature and its effects on durability , such as a statement from a compet ent national author ity or information provided by the producer . Theref ore, as soon as such information is available to the trader , the prohibition should apply irrespective of whether the trader is actually aware or unawa re of that information, for exam ple by neglecting it. For such a commercial practice to be considered unfair, it should not be necessar y to demonstrate that the purpose of the feature is to stimulate the replacement of the respective good, but it would be suffi cient to prove that the feature has been introduced to limit the durability of the good. This prohibition complements and does not affect the remedies available to consumers in the event of a lack of conf ormity under Directive (EU) 2019/771. The use of features limiting the durability of the goods should be distinguished from manuf actur ing practices using mater ials or processes of general low quality resulting in limited durability of the goods. Lack of conf ormity of a good resulting from the use of low quality mater ials or processes should continue to be governed by the rules on the conf ormity of goods set out in Directive (EU) 2019/771. (20) Another practice which should be prohibit ed under Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC is the practice of falsel y claiming that a good has a certain durability in term s of usage time or intensity under normal conditions of use. That would be the case, for instance, if a trader informs consumers that a washing machine is expect ed to last a certain number of washing cycles, in accordance with normal expecte d use indicate d in the instr uctions, while the actual use of the washing machi ne under the prescr ibed conditions shows that is not the case. Such claims are largely made by the producers, as it is they who determine the durability of the goods. Theref ore, in general, traders who are also the producers of the goods are expecte d to be aware of false claims regar ding the durability of the goods, whereas other traders such as sellers should rely on reliable information available to them, for instance based on a statement from a compet ent national author ity or information provided by the producer . Lack of conf ormity of a good resulting from occasional faults in the manufactur ing of a good should continue to be governed by the rules on the conf ormity of goods set out in Directive (EU) 2019/771. (21) Similarly , Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC should also be amended to prohibit the presentation of products as allowin g repair when such repair is not possible. (22) The prohibition of those practices in relation to durability and reparability in Directive 2005/29/EC would provide the consumer protection author ities of Member States with an additional enforcement tool for better prote ction of consumers’ interests in cases where traders fail to compl y with requirements on the durability and reparability of goods under product-specif ic Union law.OJ L, 6.3.2024 EN

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/825/oj 7/16(23) Another practice associated with early obsolescence whic h should be prohibit ed and added to the list in Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC is inducing the consumer to replace or replenish the consumables of a product earlier than would other wise be necessar y for technical reasons. Such practices mislead the consumer into believing that the goods will no long er function unless their consumables are replaced, thus leading the consumer to purch ase more consumables than necessar y. For exam ple, the practice of urging the consumer , via the settings of the printer , to replace the printer ink cartridges before they are actually empty in order to stimulate the purch ase of additional ink cartridge s should be prohibited. (24) Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC should also be amended to prohibit the withholding of information from the consumer about the impair ment of the functionality of a good when using consumables, spare parts or accessor ies that are not provid ed by the original producer . For exam ple, if a printer is designed in such a way that its functionality is limited when using ink cartridges not provi ded by the original producer of the printer , that information should not be hidden from the consumer because such a practice could mislead the consumer into purchas ing an altern ative ink cartridge which cannot be used for that printer , thus leading to unnecessar y waste streams or additional costs for the consumer . Similarly , if a smar t device is designed in such a way that its functionality is limited when using chargers or spare parts that are not provided by the original producer , that information should not be hidden from the consumer at the time of purch ase. It should also be prohibit ed to mislead the consumer into believing that using consumables, spare parts or accessor ies not supplied by the original producer will impair the functionality of a good when this is not the case. In general, traders who are also the producers of the goods are expect ed to have that information, whereas other traders such as sellers should rely on reliable information available to them, for instance based on a state ment from a compet ent national author ity or information provided by the producer . (25) In order for consumers to take better informed decisions and stimulate demand for, and supply of, more durable goods, specifi c information about a product’ s durability and reparability should be provided for all types of goods before concluding the contract. Moreover , as regar ds goods with digital elements, digital cont ent and digital services, consumers should be informed about the period during whic h free software updates are available. Theref ore, Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (13)should be amended to provi de consumers with pre-contractual information about durability , reparability and the availabi lity of updat es. Information should be provided to consumers in a clear and compreh ensible manner and in line with the accessibility requirements of Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14). The oblig ation to provide this information to consumers compl ements and does not affect the rights of consumers provid ed in Directives (EU) 2019/770 and (EU) 2019/771. (26) A good indicator of a good’s durability is the producer ’s commercial guarantee of durability within the meaning of Article 17 of Directive (EU) 2019/771. The producer ’s commercial guarant ee of durability is a commitment from a producer to the consumer on the durability of a good. More specifically , it is a commitment that a good will maintain its required functions and performa nce through normal use. In order to inform consumers about the fact that a guarant ee of durability is offered for a particular good, that information should be provid ed to the consumer using a harmonised label. Traders selling goods should be required, where the producer mak es the information available to the trader , to inform consumers about the existence and duration of any commercial guarantee of durability , offered by the producer at no additional cost, cover ing the entire good, and with a duration of more than two years. The trader should not be required to actively seek such information from the producer , for example, by searc hing on product-specific websites . To avoid confusing consumers between the commercial guarant ee of durability and the legal guarantee of conf ormity , consumers should be reminded on the harmonised label that they also benefit from the legal guarant ee of conf ormity . (13)Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on consumer rights, amending Council Directive 93/13/EEC and Directive 1999/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directive 85/577/EEC and Directive 97/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 304, 22.11.2011, p. 64). (14)Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 Apr il 2019 on the accessibility requirements for products and services (OJ L 151, 7.6.2019, p. 70).OJ L, 6.3.2024 EN

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/825/oj 8/16(27) Recent repor ts have shown that consumers are often unaware of their legal rights under Directive (EU) 2019/771. Theref ore, a harmonised notice should remind consumers about the existence and the main elements of the legal guarant ee of conf ormity , including its minimum duration of two years and a general reference to the possibility that the duration of the legal guarant ee of conf ormity can be longer under national law. This will prevent possible confusion with the information on the commercial guarant ee of durability . (28) The harmonised label should be displa yed in a prominent manner and used in a way that allows consumers to easily identify which particular good benefits from a commercial guarant ee of durability offered by the producer at no additional cost, covering the entire good, and with a duration of more than two years, for exam ple by placing the label directly on the packa ging of a particular good, by displa ying the label in a prominent manner on the shelf where the goods covered by such a guarantee are placed or by placing it directly next to the picture of the good in the case of online sale. Producers offer ing such commercial guarant ees of durability can themselves place the harmonised label directly on the particular good or on its packaging, with the aim of benefitti ng from a commercial advantage . Traders should ensure that the harmonised label is clearly visible. Meanwhile, the harmonised notice should provide a general reminder to the consumers about the legal guarant ee of conf ormity applicable to all goods in accordance with Directive (EU) 2019/771. The harmonised notice should be displa yed in a prominent manner , for example, on a poster in an eye-catch ing way on a wall in the shop, next to the check out counte r or, in cases of online sale, placed as a general reminder on the website of the trader selling goods. (29) Implementing powers should be conferr ed on the Commission as regards the design and cont ent of the harmonised label and the harmonised notice. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15). (30) In view of the minimum duration of two years of the legal guarantee of conf ormity as provided in Directive (EU) 2019/771 and the fact that many product failures occur after that time, the trader ’s oblig ation to inform consumers about the existence and duration of the producer ’s commercial guarantee of durability using a harmonised label should only apply to commercial guarant ees of durability that are offered for a period long er than two years. In addition, the harmonised label should also remind consumers of the existence of the lega l guarant ee of conf ormity . (31) In order to mak e it easier for consumers to take an informed transactional decision when compar ing goods before concluding a contract, traders should inform consumers about the existen ce and duration of the producer ’s commercial guarantee of durability for the entire good and not for specifi c components of the good. (32) The producer and the seller should remain free to offer other types of commercial guarant ees and after-sales services. However , the information provid ed to the consumer about other commercial guarant ees or services should not confuse the consumer with regar d to the existen ce and duration of the commercial guarant ee of durability offered at no additional cost by the producer , covering the entire good and with a duration of more than two years, and for which a harmonised label is used. (33) In order for consumers to make better-informed decisions and to promote competition between producers as regards the durability of goods with digital elements, the traders selling those goods should inform consumers about the minimum period during which the producer commits to provide software updat es for such goods, whether expressed as a period of time or by referen ce to a date . Likewise, traders offer ing digital content and digital services should inform consumers about the minimum period during which the provid er of the digital conte nt or digital service commits to provi de software updat es, including secur ity updat es, necessar y to keep the digital conte nt and digital services in conf ormity . This oblig ation should ensure that consumers receive this information in (15)Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 Febr uary 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concer ning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implem enting powers (OJ L 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13).OJ L, 6.3.2024 EN

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/825/oj 9/16a simple and clear manner allowing them to compar e different minimum periods. This is without prejudice to the oblig ations set out in Union law, in particular in Directives (EU) 2019/770 and (EU) 2019/771 and, where applicable, product-specific Union law. The information on software updat es should be provid ed in a manner that is not misleading under Directive 2005/29/EC. The trader should be obliged to provid e this information only where the producer or provider has made such information available. (34) Pursuant to Article 5(1), point (e), and Article 6(1), point (m), of Directive 2011/83/EU, before consumers are bound by a contract, traders are oblig ed to provid e consumers with information on the existen ce and the conditions of after-sales services, including repair services, where such services are provid ed. In addition, to allow consumers to make an informed transactional decision and choose goods that are easier to repair , traders should, where applicable, provide, before consumers are bound by the contract, the reparability score for the good as provid ed by the producer and as established at Union level. (35) In order to ensure that consumers are well informed about the reparability of the goods they purc hase, where a reparability score is not established at Union level, traders should provid e other relevant information on repair that is made available by the producer , such as information about the availability , estimated cost and procedure for order ing spare parts that are necessar y to keep the goods in conf ormity , the availability of repair and mainte nance instr uctions and repair restr ictions. (36) Traders should provide consumers with the harmonised label, information about the minimum period for updat es and information on repair other than the reparability score, where the producer or provid er of the digital cont ent or digital service, if different from the trader , mak es the relevant information available. In particular , as regards goods, the trader should conve y to consumers the information that the producer has provided to the trader or has other wise intended to make readily available to the consumer before the conclusion of the contract, by indicating it on the product itself, its packaging or tags and labels that the consumer would normally consult before concluding the contract. The trader should not be required to actively seek such information from the producer , for example, by searc hing on the product-specif ic website s. At the same time, it would be in the interest of the producers to proactively provide such information to benefi t from a commercial advantage. (37) Traders should, where applicable, inform consumers about the availability of environmentally friendly deliver y options, such as the deliver y of goods by cargo bike or electr ic deliver y vehicle or the possibility of bundled shipping options. (38) If a distance contract that is to be concluded by electronic means places the consumer under an obligation to pay, the trader should make the consumer aware of the harmonised label, whenever provi ded, in a clear and prominent manner , and directly before the consumer places an order to ensure the consumer takes that information into account. (39) Directives 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU should continue to function as a ‘safety net’, ensur ing that a high level of consumer prot ection can be maintained in all sectors by complementing sector and product-specif ic Union law that prevail in case of conf lict. (40) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely , enabling better-informed transactional decisions by consumers to promote sustainable consum ption, eliminating practices that cause damage to the sustainable economy and prevent consumers from making sustainable consum ption choices, and ensur ing a better and consistent application of the Union consumer legal framewor k, cannot be suffi ciently achieved by the Member States but can rather , by reason of the Union-wide character of the problem, be better achieve d at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiar ity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of propor tionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessar y to achi eve those objectives.OJ L, 6.3.2024 EN
