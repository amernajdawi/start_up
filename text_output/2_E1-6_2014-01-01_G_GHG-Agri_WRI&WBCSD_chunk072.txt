GHG fluxes attributable to disturbances m ay also be reported in a separate line
item   
Companies may separately estimate the amount  of GHG fluxes that they consider 
attributable to natural distur bances and report this amount out side of the scopes in a line
item that is separate from the scopes and the Biogenic Carbon category. This reporting is
additional to the report ing of these same fluxes within the scopes or the Biogenic Carbon
category. Estimating the specific GHG effects of individual disturbances is challenging
because:
1. Ambiguity often exists around whether an event is a ‘disturbance’ or simply
within the bounds of ‘normal’ envi ronmental variation. Companies might
therefore have to establish criteria for consistently recognizing disturbances.  
2. Natural disturbances may be rare events, in which case the effects on estimated
CO 2 fluxes may be small when averaged over large areas or long periods of time
and therefore difficult to accurately quan tify. For instance, the effects of a one-
year period of insect defoliation might be  difficult to distinguish from background 
fluxes over a three-year peri od. In contrast, catastrophi c disturbances such as
wind storms may cause obvious and easil y estimated changes in C stocks.  

Because of these challenges, companies should evaluate the likely size of a disturbance
before committing the resources to quantifyi ng it. For the sake of practicality, if
companies do choose to report disturbance em issions, they may assume that all post-
disturbance emissions occur in the year of  the disturbance even t. That is, the CO 2 
emissions from the long-term decay of DOM created during an event (e.g., downed trees
from a windstorm) can be reported in the year  of the event. Alternatively, these emissions 
can be amortized (see Chapter 8.3).

What is ‘amortizing’ and when is it necessary?
