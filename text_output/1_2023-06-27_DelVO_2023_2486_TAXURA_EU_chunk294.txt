ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 107/164(i) a control and monitoring plan is implemented, including measures to control the impacts of the remediation activities
and to verify the achievement of the remediation objectives and targets, for at least 10 years in case of excavation and
removal of the landfill or dumpsite and for at least 30 years in case of environmental isolation of the landfill or
dumpsite, unless a different duration sufficient to guarantee long-term risk control is defined in national legislation or
by the competent regulatory authority for the specific remediation project.
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)
(1) Climate change mitigation Where the landfill body contains significant amounts of biodegradable waste, a system
for landfill gas capture and abatement and a monitoring plan for landfill gas leakage is in
place in accordance with operational and technical requirements of Directive
1999/31/EC, or for activities located in third countries in accordance with equivalent
national law or commonly accepted international industry standards (66).
(2) Climate change adaptation The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.
(3) Sustainable use and protec ­
tion of water and marine resourcesThe activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.
Remedial measures are protective of water and marine resources and apply best industry
practices and technology (67)with the aim of:
(a) reducing the generation of leachates from the landfill and avoiding outflow or infiltration of leachates into the surrounding soil and any potential hazard to
groundwater and surface water;
(b) separately collecting and appropriately treating run-off water and leachates before
discharge;
(c) tracking and analysing leachate generation rates and leachate concentration and
composition in the after-care period through appropriate control and monitoring
systems and processes;
(d) separately collecting and appropriately treating polluted soil in and around the
landfill in order to block the pathway from the landfill to waterbodies through
heavily soaked soil.
(4) Transition to a circular economyWhere the remediation project foresees the excavation and removal of the existing landfill or dumpsite, the excavated waste is managed in accordance with the waste
hierarchy principle, prioritising recycling over other types of material recovery, over
incineration and disposal, to the extent that this is technically feasible and does not
increase risks for the environmental or human health.

standards and guidance documents for landfill management published by the International Solid Waste Association, including
