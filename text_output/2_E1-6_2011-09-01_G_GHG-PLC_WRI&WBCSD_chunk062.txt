guidanceBox [9.4]  Comparing closed loop approximation and the recycled content method
The closed loop approximation and recycled content method allocate emissions and removals differently, and
choosing one method over the other can produce different inventory results. The following simplified example
highlights this difference: in this case both methods are equally appropriate for a product that has virgin and
recycling material input, recycled material output, and waste.

Recycled material input  40%  Percent of total input
