10.3.1 Role of the uncertainty assessment process
Figure 10.1 illustrates the role of uncertainty assessment
within the GHG inventory process. Companies should
keep a list of uncertainties throughout the inventory
process in order to facilitate the uncertainty assessment,
assurance, and reporting processes.
While the reporting requirements are focused on
qualitative descriptions, quantitative assessments of
uncertainty can assist companies in prioritizing data
quality improvement efforts on the sources that
contribute most to uncertainty and in understanding the
influence methodological choices have on the overall
product inventory. A quantitative approach can also add
clarity and transparency in reporting on uncertainty to
inventory report readers. When available, companies
should report quantitative uncertainty results in the
inventory report. Guidance on quantifying uncertainty can
be found at ( www.ghgprotocol.org ).
10.3.2 Types of uncertainty
The results of a GHG inventory may be affected by various
types of uncertainty, which can arise from different
sources within the inventory process. Uncertainty is
divided into three categories: parameter uncertainty,
scenario uncertainty and model uncertainty, which are
defined in the following section. The categories are not mutually exclusive, but they are
evaluated and reported in different ways. For example,
the same uncertainty source might be characterized as
either a component of parameter uncertainty and/or as a
component of scenario uncertainty.
As shown in figure 10.1, these types of uncertainties arise
throughout the stages of the GHG inventory compilation
process.  Table 10.1 illustrates these various types of 
uncertainties and how each type can be presented.
Parameter uncertainty
Parameter uncertainty is the uncertainty regarding
whether a value used in the inventory accurately
represents the process or activity in the product’s life
cycle. If parameter uncertainty can be determined it can
typically be represented as a probability distribution of
possible values including the value used in the inventory
results. In assessing the uncertainty of a result, parameter
uncertainties can be propagated within a model to
provide a quantitative measure (also as a probability
distribution) of uncertainty in the final inventory result.
Single parameter uncertainty
Parameter uncertainty addresses the question, how well
do the data that are used to represent a parameter fit
the process in the product inventory. Single parameter
uncertainty refers to incomplete knowledge about the true
value of a parameter1.  It can arise in relation to three data
