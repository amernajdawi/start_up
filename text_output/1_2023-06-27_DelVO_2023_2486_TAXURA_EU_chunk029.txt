3.1. Nature-based solutions for flood and drought risk prevention and protection
Description of the activity
Planning, construction, extension, and operation of large-scale nature-based flood or drought management and coastal,
transitional or inland aquatic ecosystem restoration measures contributing to preventing and protecting against flooding or droughts, and enhancing natural water retention, biodiversity and water quality.
These large-scale nature-based flood or drought management measures are applied in peri-urban, rural and coastal areas
and are coordinated at river basin, regional or local, such as municipal, scale.
The economic activity includes:
(a) river or lake related measures, including:
(i) riparian or floodplain vegetation development or floodplain restoration, including re-connection of a river or lake
with its floodplain or off-channel/lateral connectivity improvement to restore the retention capacity of the
floodplain and its ecosystem’s function;
(ii) re-meandering river courses by creating a new meandering course or reconnecting cut-off meanders or reconnecting a lake or group of lakes to a river;
(iii) restoration of the longitudinal and lateral connectivity of a river (including oxbow lakes) by removing obsolete barriers, including dams and weirs or small barriers across or along the river;
(iv) substitution of artificial riverbank or lake shore protection with nature-based solutions for bank or bed
stabilisation as measures for river or lake restoration;
(v) measures aimed to improve the diversification of river or lake depth and width to increase habitat variety;
(b) wetland measures, including:
(i) installation of ditches for rewetting, removal of drainage installations, replacement with installations that control
the discharge, or setting back of dykes to enable flooding;
(ii) implementation of constructed wetlands for water retention and treatment, both on land and along unvegetated
water bodies, in rural and urban contexts;
(iii) detention basins and retention ponds;
(c) coastal measures, including:
(i) conservation or restoration of coastal wetlands including mangrove forests or seagrass beds, which operate as a
natural barrier;
(ii) measures consisting of morphological changes and the removal of barriers to minimise the need of artificial beach
nourishment and enhance the conditions of coastal ecosystems, justified on the basis of a sediment balance study;
(iii) dune reinforcement and restoration, including the planting of dune vegetation;
(iv) coastal reef conservation or restoration;
(v) sand nourishments in the coastal zone;
(d) river basin-wide management measures, including:
(i) land management measures, including afforestation of reservoir catchments areas, spring or wellhead protection
areas and river basin headwaters in general;
(ii) restoration of natural infiltration for groundwater recharge by facilitating or augmenting soil retention capacity and infiltration;
(iii) managed aquifer recharge (MAR) (
13).
(13)Managed aquifer recharge is ‘the process of intentionally recharging an aquifer with water from a different place for subsequent
recovery or for environmental benefits’.OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
