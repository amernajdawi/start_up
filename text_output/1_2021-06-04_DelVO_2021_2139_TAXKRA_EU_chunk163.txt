6.14.  Infrastructure for rail transport  
Description of the activity  
Construction, modernisation, operation and maintenance of railways and subways as well as bridges and tunnels,
stations, terminals, rail service facilities (  273  ), safety and traffic management systems including the provision of 
architectural services, engineering services, drafting services, building inspection services and surveying and
mapping services and the like as well as the performance of physical, chemical and other analytical testing of
all types of materials and products.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular F42.12,
F42.13, M71.12, M71.20, F43.21, and H52.21 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic
activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 10(1), point (i), of Regulation
(EU) 2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. The activity complies with one of the following criteria:
(a) the infrastructure (as defined in Annex II.2 to Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and of the
Council (  274  )) is either: 
(i) electrified trackside infrastructure and associated subsystems: infrastructure, energy, on-board control-
command and signalling, and trackside control-command and signalling subsystems as defined in
Annex II.2 to Directive (EU)2016/797;
(ii) new and existing trackside infrastructure and associated subsystems where there is a plan for electrifi ­
cation as regards line tracks, and, to the extent necessary for electric train operations, as regards sidings,
or where the infrastructure will be fit for use by zero tailpipe CO  2 emission trains within 10 years from 
the beginning of the activity: infrastructure, energy, on-board control-command and signalling, and
trackside control-command and signalling subsystems as defined in Annex II.2 to Directive
(EU)2016/797;
(iii) until 2030, existing trackside infrastructure and associated subsystems that are not part of the TEN-T
network (  275  ) and its indicative extensions to third countries, nor any nationally, supranationally or 
internationally defined network of major rail lines: infrastructure, energy, on-board control-command
and signalling, and trackside control-command and signalling subsystems as defined in Annex II.2 to
Directive (EU) 2016/797;
(b) the infrastructure and installations are dedicated to transhipping freight between the modes: terminal infra ­
structure and superstructures for loading, unloading and transhipment of goods;
(c) infrastructure and installations are dedicated to the transfer of passengers from rail to rail or from other
modes to rail.
2. The infrastructure is not dedicated to the transport or storage of fossil fuels.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.
