Disclosure Requirement E1-1 – Transition plan for climate change mitigation
14. The undertaking shall disclose its transition plan for climate change mitigatio
n(28).
15. The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to enable an understanding of the undertaking’s past, current, and
future mitigation efforts to ensure that its strategy and business model are compatible with the transition to a
sustainable economy, and with the limiting of global warming to 1.5 °C in line with the Paris Agreement and with
the objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 and, where relevant, the undertaking’s exposure to coal, oil and
gas-related activities.
16. The information required by paragraph 14 shall include:
(a) by reference to GHG emission reduction targets (as required by Disclosure Requirement E1-4), an explanation of
how the undertaking’s targets are compatible with the limiting of global warming to 1.5°C in line with the Paris
Agreement;
(b) by reference to GHG emission reduction targets (as required by Disclosure Requirement E1-4) and the climate
change mitigation actions (as required by Disclosure Requirement E1-3), an explanation of the decarbonisation
levers identified, and key actions planned, including changes in the undertaking’s product and service portfolio
and the adoption of new technologies in its own operations, or the upstream and/or downstream value chain;
(c) by reference to the climate change mitigation actions (as required by Disclosure Requirement E1-3), an
explanation and quantification of the undertaking’s investments and funding supporting the implementation of
its transition plan, with a reference to the key performance indicators of taxonomy-aligned CapEx, and where
relevant the CapEx plans, that the undertaking discloses in accordance with Commission Delegated Regulation
(EU) 2021/2178;
(d) a qualitative assessment of the potential locked-in GHG emissions from the undertaking’s key assets and
products. This shall include an explanation of if and how these emissions may jeopardise the achievement of the
undertaking’s GHG emission reduction targets and drive transition risk, and if applicable, an explanation of the
undertaking’s plans to manage its GHG-intensive and energy-intensive assets and products;
(e) for undertakings with economic activities that are covered by delegated regulations on climate adaptation or mitigation under the Taxonomy Regulation, an explanation of any objective or plans (CapEX, CapEx plans, OpEX) that the undertaking has for aligning its economic activities (revenues, CapEx, OpEx) with the criteria
established in Commission Delegated Regulation 2021/2139 (
29);
(f) if applicable, a disclosure of significant CapEx amounts invested during the reporting period related to coal, oil
and gas-related economic activities; (30)
(28)This information is aligned with the Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU Climate Law),
Article 2 (1); and with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 (Climate Benchmark Regulation), Article 2.
(29)Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of 4 June 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an
economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation and for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives (OJ L 442,
9.12.2021, p. 1).
(30)The CapEx amounts considered are related to the following NACE codes:
(a) B.05 Mining of coal and lignite, B.06 Extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas (limited to crude petroleum), B.09.1 Support
activities for petroleum and natural gas extraction (limited to crude petroleum),
(b) C.19 Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products,
