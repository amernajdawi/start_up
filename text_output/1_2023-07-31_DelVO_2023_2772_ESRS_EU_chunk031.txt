Estimation using sector averages and proxies
AR 17. When the undertaking cannot collect upstream and downstream value chain information as required by
paragraph 63 after making reasonable efforts to do so, it shall estimate the information to be reported using all
reasonable and supportable information that is available to the undertaking at the reporting date without undue
cost or effort. This includes, but is not limited to, internal and external information, such as data from indirect
sources, sector-average data, sample analyses, market and peer groups data, other proxies or spend-based data.
Content and structure of the sustainability statement
AR 18. As an illustration for paragraph 115 in section 8.2 Content and structure of the sustainability statement of this
Standard, the undertaking that covers environmental and social matters in the same policy may cross-refer. That
means that the undertaking may report on the policy in its environmental disclosures and cross-refer to it from
the relevant social disclosures or vice versa. Consolidated presentation of policies across topics is allowed.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
