With regard to the computation of the GAR for investment firmsâ€™ services and activities dealing on own account,
investment firms shall rely on the turnover KPI and CapEx KPI of investee undertakings for each environmental objective.
The numerator shall be designed as the value of investments weighted by the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned economic
