The reporting of scope 3 sources  is optional, but encouraged  
Scope 3 sources are many and diverse. The Sc ope 3 Standard identifies 15 distinct
categories. These include the activities of  the reporting company’s direct suppliers, 
cradle-to-gate impacts further upstream, as well as downstream activities, such as the
customer use and disposal of products the company has manufactured and sold.  Which 
scope 3 sources should be included in an inventory? Companies may either:  
 1. Report scope 3 emissions in accordance with  the Corporate Standard (i.e. scope 3 
sources are optional)  
2. Report scope 3 emissions in accordance with the Scope 3 Standard  
 For many companies, scope 3 emissions will represent a significant component of overall GHG impacts. For instance, the manufacture of  fertilizer and livestock feed will be 
important scope 3 sources for crop and lives tock operations, respectively. Moreover,
companies may undertake some actions that reduce their scope 1 and 2 emissions, but
that then increase their scope 3 emissions (e.g., the outsourcing of feed production).  For 
these reasons, specific scope 3 sources s hould be reported where those sources are
considered significant. Criteria for as sessing significance can include amounts of
emissions, emissions reduction potential, contri bution to risk exposur e (e.g., regulatory or
reputational risks), and importance to stakeh olders. In general, the scope 3 emissions
from fertilizer and feed production should be included in inventories, where possible.  
9.4 Agricultural offset and renewable energy projects

Companies can generate renewabl e energy in many ways, including:
 Developing their own wind turbines or leasing land to wind power development
firms  
 Growing trees, short rotation woodland a nd short rotation coppi ce as a source of
biomass fuel stock  
 Installing anaerobic digesters to produce methane as fuel for electricity or heat
 Developing farm-scale micro hydroelectricity  schemes (typically less than ~ 100kW)  
 Using solar panels

Such projects are a potential s ource of offset credits. Other offset projects could be based
on the reforestation or rest oration of degraded lands and changes in fertilizer
management.
