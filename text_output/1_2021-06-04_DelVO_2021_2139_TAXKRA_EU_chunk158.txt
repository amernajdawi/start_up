6.11.  Sea and coastal passenger water transport  
Description of the activity  
Purchase, financing, chartering (with or without crew) and operation of vessels designed and equipped for
performing passenger transport, on sea or coastal waters, whether scheduled or not. The economic activities in
this category include operation of ferries, water taxies and excursions, cruise or sightseeing boats.  
The activity could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular H50.10, N77.21 and N77.34 in
accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Where an economic activity in this category does not fulfil the substantial contribution criterion specified in point
(a) of this Section, the activity is a transitional activity as referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852,
provided it complies with the remaining technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The activity complies with one or more of the following criteria:
(a) the vessels have zero direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emissions; 
(b) where technologically and economically not feasible to comply with the criterion in point (a), until
31 December 2025, hybrid and dual fuel vessels derive at least 25 % of their energy from zero direct
(tailpipe) CO  2 emission fuels or plug-in power for their normal operation at sea and in ports; 
(c) where technologically and economically not feasible to comply with the criterion in point (a), until
31 December 2025, the vessels have an attained Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) (  260  ) value 10 % 
below the EEDI requirements applicable on 1 April 2022 (  261  ), if the vessels are able to run on zero direct 
(tailpipe) emission fuels or on fuels from renewable sources (  262  ). 
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Measures are in place to manage waste, both in the use phase and in the 
end-of-life of the vessel, in accordance with the waste hierarchy.
For battery-operated vessels, those measures include reuse and recycling of
batteries and electronics, including critical raw materials therein.
For existing ships above 500 gross tonnage and the new-built ones
replacing them, the activity complies with the requirements of Regulation
(EU) No 1257/2013 relating to the inventory of hazardous materials. The
scrap ships are recycled in facilities included on the European List of ship
recycling facilities as laid down in Implementing Decision 2016/2323.

( 261  ) EEDI requirements as agreed by the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organization on its 
seventy-fifth session. Vessels that fall into the ship types set out in MARPOL Annex VI Regulation 2 but are not considered as
new ship under that regulation may provide attained EEDI value calculated on a voluntary basis in line with MARPOL
Annex VI Chapter 4 and have those calculations verified in line with MARPOL Annex VI Chapter 2.
