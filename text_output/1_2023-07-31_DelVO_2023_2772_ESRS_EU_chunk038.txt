ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 37/284Appendix E Flowchart for determining disclosures under ESRS Materiality assessment is the starting point for sustainability reporting under ESRS. This appendix provides a non-binding illustration of the impact- and financial materiality assessment outlined in chapter 3. IRO-1 in section 4.1 of ESRS 2 includes general disclosure requirements (DR) about the undertaking’s process to identify impacts, risks and opportunities and assess their materiality. SBM-3 of ESRS 2 provides general disclosures requirements on the material impact, risks and opportunities resulting from the undertaking’s materiality assessment. The undertaking can omit all disclosure requirements in a topical standard if it assessed that the topic in question is not material. In that case it may disclose a brief explanation of the conclusions of the materiality assessment for that topic but shall disclose a detailed explanation in the case of ESRS E1 climate change (IRO-2 ESRS 2). ESRS set disclosure requirements, not behavioral requirements. Disclosure requirements in relation to action plans, targets, policies, scenario analysis and transition plans are proportionate because they are contingent on the undertaking having these, which may depend on the size, capacity, resources, and skills of the undertaking. Note: The flowchart below does not cover the situation in which the undertaking assesses a sustainability matter as material but it is not covered by a topical standard, in which case the undertaking shall make additional entity specific disclosures (ESRS 1 (30 (b)).
