Application Requirements
This Appendix is an integral part of the ESRS E1. It supports the application of the disclosure requirements set out in this
standard and has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard.
Strategy
Disclosure Requirement E1-1 – Transition plan for climate change mitigation
AR 1. A transition plan relates to the undertaking’s efforts in climate change mitigation. When disclosing its transition
plan, the undertaking is expected to provide a high-level explanation of how it will adjust its strategy and business
model to ensure compatibility with the transition to a sustainable economy and with the limiting of global
warming to 1.5°C in line with the Paris Agreement (or an updated inter national agreement on climate change)
and the objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 with no or limited overshoot as established in
Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 (European Climate Law), and where applicable, how it will adjust its exposure to coal,
and oil and gas-related activities.
AR 2. Sectoral pathways have not yet been defined by the public policies for all sectors. Hence, the disclosure under
paragraph 16 (a) on the compatibility of the transition plan with the objective of limiting global warming to 1.5°
C should be understood as the disclosure of the undertaking’s GHG emissions reduction target . The disclosure
under paragraph 16 (a) shall be benchmarked in relation to a pathway to 1.5°C. This benchmark should be based
on either a sectoral decarbonisation pathway if available for the undertaking’s sector or an economy-wide
scenario bearing in mind its limitations (i.e., it is a simple translation of emission reduction objectives from the
state to undertaking level). This AR should be read also in conjunction with AR 26 and AR 27 and the sectoral decarbonisation pathways they refer to.
AR 3. When disclosing the information required under paragraph 16(d) the undertaking may consider:
(a) the cumulative locked-in GHG emissions associated with key assets from the reporting year until 2030
and 2050 in tCO2eq. This will be assessed as the sum of the estimated Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions over the operating lifetime of the active and firmly planned key assets. Key assets are those owned or controlled by
the undertaking, and they consist of existing or planned assets (such as stationary or mobile installations,
facilities, and equipment) that are sources of either significant direct or energy-indirect GHG emissions. Firmly
planned key assets are those that the undertaking will most likely deploy within the next 5 years.
(b) the cumulative locked-in GHG emissions associated with the direct use-phase GHG emissions of sold products
in tCO2eq, assessed as the sales volume of products in the reporting year multiplied by the sum of estimated
direct use-phase GHG emissions over their expected lifetime. This requirement only applies if the undertaking
has identified the Scope 3 category “use of sold products” as significant under Disclosure Requirement E1-6
paragraph 51; and
(c) an explanation of the plans to manage, i.e., to transform, decommission or phase out its GHG-intensive and energy-intensive assets and products.
AR 4. When disclosing the information required under paragraph 16 (e), the undertaking shall explain how the
alignment of its economic activities with the provisions of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 is
expected to evolve over time to support its transition to a sustainable economy. In doing so, the undertaking shall
take account of the key performance indicators required to be disclosed under Article 8 of Regulation
(EU) 2020/852 (in particular taxonomy-aligned revenue and CapEx and, if applicable, CapEx plans).OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
