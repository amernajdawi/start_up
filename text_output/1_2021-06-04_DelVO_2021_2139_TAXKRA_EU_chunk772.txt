Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  The trains and wagons are not dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  N/A  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Measures are in place to manage waste in accordance with the waste 
hierarchy, in particular during maintenance.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Engines for the propulsion of railway locomotives (RLL) and engines for 
the propulsion of railcars (RLR) comply with emission limits set out in
Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2016/1628.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  N/A  
6.3.  Urban and suburban transport, road passenger transport  
Description of the activity  
Purchase, financing, leasing, rental and operation of urban and suburban transport vehicles for passengers and road

Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
