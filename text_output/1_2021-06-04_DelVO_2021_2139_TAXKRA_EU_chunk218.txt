1.3.  Forest management  
Description of the activity  
Forest management as defined by national law. Where national law does not contain such a definition, forest
management refers to any economic activity resulting from a system applicable to a forest that influences the
ecological, economic or social functions of the forest. Forest management assumes no change in land use and
occurs on land matching the definition of forest as set out in national law, or where not available, in accordance
with the FAO definition of forest (  36 ). 
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code A2 in accordance with the statistical
classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006. The economic activities in this
category are limited to NACE II 02.10, i.e. silviculture and other forestry activities, 02.20, i.e. logging, 02.30,
i.e. gathering of wild growing non-wood products and 02.40, i.e. support services to forestry.  
Where an economic activity in this category complies with the substantial contribution criterion specified in
point 5, the activity is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU)
2020/852, provided that it meets the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.
The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan,
such that:
(a) for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using
climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale;
(b) for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state-of-the-art
climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios (  37 ) consistent with the expected lifetime of 
the activity, including, at least, 10 to 30 year climate projections scenarios for major investments.
3. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and
take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line
with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports (  38 ), scientific peer-reviewed publications 
and open source (  39 ) or paying models.
