with industry groups and governments to promote its
widespread use – along with the entire suite of GHG
Protocol standards and tools – to enable more effective
GHG management worldwide.
1.1 The Greenhouse Gas Protocol
The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol is a multistakeholder
partnership of businesses, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), governments, and others convened
by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World
Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).
Launched in 1998, the mission of the GHG Protocol is
to develop internationally accepted greenhouse gas
(GHG) accounting and reporting standards and tools,
and to promote their adoption in order to achieve a low
emissions economy worldwide.
The GHG Protocol follows a broad, inclusive, consensus-
based multi-stakeholder process to develop these
standards with balanced participation from businesses,
government agencies, non-governmental organizations,
and academic institutions from around the world. The
standards include detailed guidance to assist users with
implementation and are freely available on the GHG
Protocol website (www.ghgprotocol.org). The GHG Protocol has produced the following separate,
but complementary standards, protocols, and guidelines:  
 •GHG Protocol  Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard  (2004):  A standardized methodology for 
companies to quantify and report their corporate GHG
emissions. Also referred to as the Corporate Standard .
•GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3)
Accounting and Reporting Standard  (2011):   
A standardized methodology for companies to quantify
and report their corporate value chain (scope 3) GHG
emissions, to be used in conjunction with the Corporate
Standard . Also referred to as the Scope 3 Standard .
 •GHG Protocol for  Project Accounting  (2005):   
A guide for quantifying reductions from GHG-mitigation
projects. Also referred to as the Project Protocol.  
 •GHG Protocol for the U.S. Public Sector  (2010):  
A step-by-step approach to measuring and reporting
emissions from public sector organizations,
complementary to the Corporate Standard.
•GHG Protocol Guidelines for Quantifying GHG
Reductions from Grid-Connected Electricity Projects  
(2007): A guide for quantifying reductions in emissions
that either generate or reduce the consumption of
electricity transmitted over power grids, to be used in
conjunction with the  Project Protocol.
