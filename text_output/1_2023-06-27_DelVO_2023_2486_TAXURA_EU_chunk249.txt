ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 92/164The LDAR campaigns have the features described in BAT19 of the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common
waste gas management and treatment systems in the chemical sector, which include detecting, repairing and maintaining
leaks within 30 days of detection and a leak threshold that is lower than or equal to 5 000 ppmv for substances or
mixtures other than those classified as CMR 1A or 1B, which are reviewed and updated for the continuous improvement of the installation. Solvent losses and recovery efficiency of VOC are monitored based on a solvent management plan
using a mass balance for verification of compliance, in accordance with Chapter V of Directive 2010/75/EU.
2.4. Sewage, refuse, and other waste (including solids, liquids, or gaseous by-products from manufacturing) are disposed of
in a safe, timely and sanitary manner. Containers or pipes for waste material are clearly identified. Analytical data
demonstrating the conversion of these substances and their residues to non-hazardous waste materials are available at the
facility and kept up to date.
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)(1) Climate change mitigation Where the activity involves on-site generation of heat/cool or co-generation including
power, the direct GHG emissions of the activity are lower than 270 gCO
2e/kWh.
For the refrigerant threshold, the Global Warming Potential does not exceed 150 in cooling of the substance.
Where active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) or active substances are made from
substances listed in Sections 3.10 to 3.16 of Annex II to Delegated Regulation
(EU) 2021/2139, the GHG emissions do not exceed the limits set out in their
respective criteria for DNSH to climate change mitigation.
The substitution does not lead to an increment of lifecycle GHG emissions. Lifecycle
GHG emissions are calculated using Recommendation 2013/179/EU or, alternatively,
using ISO 14067:2018 (
16)or ISO 14064-1:2018 (17). Quantified life-cycle GHG
emissions are verified by an independent third party.
(2) Climate change adaptation The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.
(3) Sustainable use and protec ­
tion of water and marine resources1. Waste water treatment
The performance of waste water treatment processes conducted by or on behalf of the
manufacturing plant does not lead to any deterioration of water bodies and marine
resources.
When activities fall within their scope, they meet the requirements of Directives
