CHAPTER 11 Calculating Inventory Results[87]
referred to as emission discounting). In this standard,
inventory results shall not be calculated with weighting
factors. This is true for both biogenic and non-biogenic
emissions, removals, and products. Companies may show
the impact of delayed emissions and removals separately
from the inventory results. It is important to note that
if a weighting factor is applied to calculate the impact
of delayed emissions or removals in the end-of-life
stage, the same factor needs to be applied to end-of-life
allocation of co-products and recycled materials.
Offsets and avoided emissions are both classified as
actions that occur outside the boundary of the product’s
life cycle. Offsets are emission credits (in the form of
emission trading or funding of emission-reductions1
projects) that a company purchases to offset the studied
product’s inventory results. Avoided emissions are
quantified as emissions reductions that are indirectly
caused by the studied product or a process that occurs
in the studied product’s life cycle. Avoided emissions as
defined here are not the same as emissions reductions
that occur due to directly attributable reduction projects,
or allocated emissions using the system expansion
allocation method. Purchased offsets and avoided
emissions shall not be deducted from the product’s
total inventory results, but may be reported separately.
Guidance on using offsets to meet reduction targets is
available in chapter 14.
Companies shall report the amount of carbon
contained in the product or its components
that is not released to the atmosphere
during waste treatment, if applicable. For
cradle-to-gate inventories, companies shall
report the amount of carbon contained in the
intermediate product.
