Box 9-1.   Defining land-use change 
To determine when LUC has occurred and to ensure LUC impacts are accounted for consistently across inventories, companies should use a consistent set of definitions for land use categories over time. Currently, th ere is no single intern ationally accepted
standard for land use classifi cation – different countries a nd international organizations
have developed their own sets of definiti ons. Companies may find it simpler to use a
country-specific classification system shoul d their operations occu r within a single
country. Companies with agricultural operations  in multiple countries may instead find it

 easier to use internationally  recognized classification systems (e.g., the EU’s CORINE 
system). A simplified set of land use categories is shown below.    LUC occurs when land is converted fr om one land use category to another
13; for instance,
when cropland is converted to grassland or when forests are converted to cropland. On
occasion, the same area of land might be used  to support multiple agricultural activities 
and so meet the definitions for different land-use categories. For instance, savannah
woodland might be used both to graze livesto ck and as a source of wood fuel. In such
cases, companies should categorize the land based on the agricultural activity that is economically most important .
