TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS  (  1 ) FOR WATER APPLIANCES  
1. The flow rate is recorded at the standard reference pressure 3 – 0/+ 0,2 bar or 0,1 – 0/+ 0,02 for products limited
to low pressure.  
2. The flow rate at the lower pressure 1,5 – 0/+ 0,2 bar is ≥ 60 % of the maximum available flow rate.  
3. For mixer showers, the reference temperature is 38 ± 1 °C.  
4. Where the flow has to be lower than 6 L/min, it complies with the rule set out in point 2.  
5. For taps the procedure described in clause 10.2.3 of EN 200 is followed, with the following exceptions:  
(a) for taps that are not limited to low pressure applications only: apply a 3 – 0/+ 0,2 bar pressure to both the
hot and the cold inlets, alternatively;  
(b) for taps that are limited to low pressure applications only: apply a 0,4 – 0/+ 0,02 bar pressure to both the hot
and the cold inlets and fully open the flow control.EN  9.12.2021 Official Journal of the European Union L 442/145
