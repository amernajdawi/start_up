CHAPTER 7 Managing Inventory Quality 57GUIDANCE NOTES 1Although the term “emissions inventory” is used throughout this chapter, the guidance equally applies to estimates of removals due to sink cate-gories (e.g., forest carbon sequestration). 2Some emission estimates may be derived using mass or energybalances, engineering calculations, or computer simulation models. Inaddition to investigating the input data to these models, companiesshould also consider whether the internal assumptions (includingassumed parameters in the model) are appropriate to the nature of thecompany’s operations. 3Emissions estimated from direct emissions monitoring will generally onlyinvolve parameter uncertainty (e.g., equipment measurement error). 4Statistical uncertainty results from natural variations (e.g., randomhuman errors in the measurement process and fluctuations in measure-ment equipment). Statistical uncertainty can be detected throughrepeated experiments or sampling of data.5Systematic parameter uncertainty occurs if data are systematicallybiased. In other words, the average of the measured or estimated value isalways less or greater than the true value. Biases arise, for example,because emission factors are constructed from non-representativesamples, all relevant source activities or categories have not been identi-fied, or incorrect or incomplete estimation methods or faulty measurementequipment have been used. Because the true value is unknown, suchsystematic biases cannot be detected through repeated experiments and,therefore, cannot be quantified through statistical analysis. However, it ispossible to identify biases and, sometimes, to quantify them through dataquality investigations and expert judgments. 6The role of expert judgment can be twofold: First, it can provide the datanecessary to estimate the parameter. Second, it can help (in combinationwith data quality investigations) identify, explain, and quantify bothstatistical and systematic uncertainties. 7It should be recognized, however, that biases may not be constant fromyear to year but instead may exhibit a pattern over time (e.g., may begrowing or falling). For example, a company that continues to disinvest incollecting high quality data may create a situation in which the biases inits data get worse each year. These types of data quality issues areextremely problematic because of the effect they can have on calculatedemission trends. In such cases, systematic parameter uncertaintiescannot be ignored.
