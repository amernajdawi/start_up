(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
6.17.  Low carbon airport infrastructure  
Description of the activity  
Construction, modernisation, maintenance and operation of infrastructure that is required for zero tailpipe CO  2 
operation of aircraft or the airport’s own operations, as well as for provision of fixed electrical ground power and
preconditioned air to stationary aircraft.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular F41.20 and
F42.99 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 10(1) point (i), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852
where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. The activity complies with one or more of the following criteria:
(a) the infrastructure is dedicated to the operation of aircraft with zero tailpipe CO  2 emissions: electricity 
charging and hydrogen refuelling;
(b) the infrastructure is dedicated to the provision of fixed electrical ground power and preconditioned air to
stationary aircrafts;
(c) the infrastructure is dedicated to the zero direct emissions performance of the airport’s own operations:
electric charging points, electricity grid connection upgrades, hydrogen refuelling stations.
2. The infrastructure is not dedicated to the transport or storage of fossil fuels.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  At least 70 % (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and 
demolition waste (excluding naturally occurring material defined in
category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by
Decision 2000/532/EC) generated on the construction site is prepared
for reuse, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling oper ­
ations using waste to substitute other materials, in accordance with the
waste hierarchy and the EU Construction and Demolition Waste
Management Protocol (  280  ). Operators limit waste generation in processes 
related to construction and demolition, in accordance with the EU
Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol and taking
into account best available techniques and using selective demolition to
enable removal and safe handling of hazardous substances and facilitate
reuse and high-quality recycling by selective removal of materials, using
available sorting systems for construction and demolition waste.
