The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code D35.21 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. Agricultural biomass used for the manufacture of biogas or biofuels for use in transport and for the
manufacture of bioliquids complies with the criteria laid down in Article 29, paragraphs 2 to 5, of Directive
(EU) 2018/2001. Forest biomass used for the manufacture of biogas or biofuels for use in transport and for the
manufacture of bioliquids complies with the criteria laid down in Article 29, paragraphs 6 and 7, of that
Directive.
Food-and feed crops are not used for the manufacture of biofuels for use in transport and for the manufacture of
bioliquids.
2. The greenhouse gas emission savings from the manufacture of biofuels and biogas for use in transport and
from the manufacture of bioliquids are at least 65 % in relation to the GHG saving methodology and the relative
fossil fuel comparator set out in Annex V to Directive (EU) 2018/2001.
3. Where the manufacture of biogas relies on anaerobic digestion of organic material, the production of the
digestate meets the criteria in Sections 5.6 and criteria 1 and 2 of Section 5.7 of this Annex, as applicable.
4. Where the CO  2 that otherwise would be emitted from the manufacturing process is captured for the 
purpose of underground storage, the CO  2 is transported and stored underground in accordance with the 
technical screening criteria set out in Sections 5.11 and 5.12 of this Annex.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  For biogas production, a gas-tight cover on the digestate storage is applied. 
For anaerobic digestion plants treating over 100 tonnes per day, emissions
to air and water are within or lower than the emission levels associated
with the best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set for anaerobic
treatment of waste in the latest relevant best available techniques (BAT)
conclusions, including the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for
waste treatment (  186  ). No significant cross-media effects occur. 
In case of anaerobic digestion of organic material, where the produced
digestate is used as fertiliser or soil improver, either directly or after
composting or any other treatment, it meets the requirements for ferti ­
lising materials set out in Component Material Categories (CMC) 4 and 5
for digestate or CMC 3 for compost, as applicable, in Annex II to
Regulation EU 2019/1009 or national rules on fertilisers or soil
improvers for agricultural use.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.
