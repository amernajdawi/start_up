Technical screening criteria
Substantial contribution to the transition to a circular economy
1.The activity provides the customer (physical or legal persons) with access to, and use of product(s), while ensuring that
the ownership remains with the company providing this service, such as a manufacturer, specialist or retailer. The
contractual terms and conditions ensure that all the following sub-criteria are met:
(a) there is an obligation for the provider of the service to take back the used product at the end of the contractual
agreement;
(b) there is an obligation for the customer to give back the used product at the end of the contractual agreement;
(c) the provider of the service remains owner of the product;
(d) the customer pays for access to and use of the product, or the result of access to and use of this product.
2.The activity leads to an extended lifespan or increased use intensity of the product in practice.
3.Where the economic activity involves delivery of packaged products to customers (physical person or legal person)
including when the activity is operated as an e-commerce (180), the primary and secondary packaging of the product
complies with one of the following criteria:
(a) the packaging is made of at least 65 % recycled material. Where the packaging is made from paper or cardboard, the
remaining primary raw material are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the Programme for the
Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes (PEFC International), or equivalent recognised schemes. Coatings with
plastics or metals are not used. For plastic packaging only monomaterials without coatings are used, halogen-
containing polymers are not used. A declaration of compliance is provided specifying the material composition of the
packaging and the shares of recycled and primary raw material;
(b) the packaging has been designed to be reusable within a reuse system (181). The system for reuse is established in a way
that ensures the possibility of reuse in a closed-loop or open-loop system.
