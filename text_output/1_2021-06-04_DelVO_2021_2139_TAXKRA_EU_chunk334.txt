(b) favour nature-based solutions (  390  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  391  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  An assessment of the direct GHG emissions from the centralised waste 
water system, including collection (sewer network) and treatment, has
been performed (  392  ). The results are disclosed to investors and clients 
on demand.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.
Where the waste water is treated to a level suitable for reuse in agricultural
irrigation, the required risk management actions to avoid adverse environ ­
mental impacts have been defined and implemented (  393  ). 
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Discharges to receiving waters meet the requirements laid down in 
Directive 91/271/EEC or as required by national provisions stating
maximum permissible pollutant levels from discharges to receiving waters.
Appropriate measures have been implemented to avoid and mitigate
excessive storm water overflows from the waste water collection system,
which may include nature-based solutions, separate storm water collection
systems, retention tanks and treatment of the first flush.
Sewage sludge is used in accordance with Directive 86/278/EEC or as
required by national law relating to the spreading of sludge on the soil
or any other application of sludge on and in the soil.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
5.4.  Renewal of waste water collection and treatment  
Description of the activity  
Renewal of centralised waste water systems including collection (sewer network) and treatment. It implies no
material change related to the load or volume of flow collected or treated in the waste water system.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code E37.00 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.

( 390  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta neously 
provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nat ure
and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and syste mic
interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosystem service s

and the Committee of the Regions: Green Infrastructure (GI) — Enhancing Europe’s Natural Capital (COM/2013/0249 final).  
( 392  ) For example, following IPCC guidelines for national GHG inventories for waste water treatment (version of 4.6.2021:
