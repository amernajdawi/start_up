engages, as part of its ongoing due diligence process, with consumers and/or end-users, their legitimate
representatives, or with credible proxies, about material actual and potential positive and/or negative impacts that
do or are likely to affect them, and whether and how perspectives of consumers and/or end-users are taken into
account in the decision-making processes of the undertaking.
20. The undertaking shall disclose whether and how the perspectives of consumers and/or end-users inform its decisions
or activities aimed at managing actual and potential impacts on consumers and/or end-users. This shall include, where relevant, an explanation of:
(a) whether engagement occurs with affected consumers and/or end-users or their legitimate representatives
directly, or with credible proxies that have insight into their situation;
(b) the stage(s) at which engagement occurs, the type of engagement, and the frequency of the engagement;
(c) the function and the most senior role within the undertaking that has operational responsibility for ensuring this
engagement happens and that the results inform the undertaking’s approach; and
(d) where applicable, how the undertaking assesses the effectiveness of its engagement with consumers and/or end-
users, and, where relevant, any agreements or outcomes that result from such engagement.
21. Where applicable, the undertaking shall disclose the steps it takes to gain insight into the perspectives of consumers
and/or end-users that may be particularly vulnerable to impacts and/or marginalised (for example, people with
disabilities, children, etc.).

engage with consumers and/or end-users, it shall disclose this to be the case. It may disclose a timeframe in which it
aims to have such a process in place.
