10  Distribution is used in reference to land-use change impacts to 
refer to the apportionment of impacts over the amortization
period. Allocation is defined in chapter 9 as portioning inputs and
outputs of a common process to its product and co-products.
Both can occur when calculating land-use change impacts.
11 Remote sensing is when current multispectral sensors provide
spectral data for identifying and mapping the crop types allowing
for precise monitoring of land-use changes. Current drawbacks of
this method are the relatively recent systematic data collection
(no regular multispectral coverage for 20 years ago timeframe),
and the costs of images and processing.
12 Some examples of market-based models for the agriculture
and forestry sector include the Food and Agricultural Policy
Research Institute (FAPRI) and the Forest and Agricultural Sector
Optimization Model (FASOM).
