For existing activities and new activities using existing physical assets, the economic operator implements physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’), over a period of time of up to five years, that reduce the most important
identified physical climate risks that are material to that activity. An adaptation plan for the implementation of those
solutions is drawn up accordingly.
For new activities and existing activities using newly-built physical assets, the economic operator integrates the
adaptation solutions that reduce the most important identified physical climate risks that are material to that activity
at the time of design and construction and has implemented them before the start of operations.
The adaptation solutions implemented do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to
physical climate risks of other people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities; are
consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation strategies and plans; and consider the use of nature-
based solutions (

(4)Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously
provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature
