CHAPTER 10 Assessing Uncertainty
guidanceWhen comparing the uncertainties between two or more
processes, stages, or products, it is important to track any
common inputs, outputs, and/or processes. When the
two items being compared share common elements their
uncertainties are likely correlated, which should not be
included in the uncertainty comparison result. Because
of correlation, a comparison of two relatively uncertain
results could have relatively high certainty. Identifying
correlations is important in tracking any changes in the
product’s inventory over time.
EXAMPLE
The manufacturer of the toner cartridge determines the
product inventory’s parameter uncertainty is +/- 20 percent.
The company develops a lighter weight cartridge body,
reducing 30 percent of the weight of that component and
3 percent of the total product inventory result. Besides the
difference in weight, the processes in the two inventories are
the same and the data sources are also consistent.  Therefore, 
while both the original and revised inventories each have a
parameter uncertainty of +/- 20 percent and the difference in
their results is 3 percent, the company can be confident that
the new design has a lower GHG impact. Endnotes
1 Parameter refers to the value(s) assigned to processes, inputs,
outputs, within the product’s life cycle.
2 In some cases, such as in the use of log-normal distributions,
the distribution around the mean is not symmetrical and the
upper and lower confidence levels might need to be specified
separately (e.g., “-10, +20”, rather than “+/- 15).

5 The description of single parameter uncertainty is included in the
data quality reporting requirements (see chapter 7).Table [10.2] Qualitative description of required uncertainty sources
Source of uncertainty Qualitative description
Scenario uncertainty
• Use profile4Describe the use profile of the product. If more than one use profile
was applicable, disclose which method was used and justify the choice.
• End-of-life profile4 Describe the end-of-life profile of the product. If more than one end-
of-life profile was applicable, disclose which method was used and
justify the choice.
• Allocation method(s) Describe any allocation problems in the inventory and which
allocation method was used. If more than one allocation method was
applicable, disclose which method was used and justify the choice.
• Recycling allocation method(s) Disclose and reference which method was used (closed loop
approximation method or recycled content method).
Parameter uncertainty5
• Global warming potential factors List the source of global warming potential (GWP) factors used.
Model uncertainty
• Model sources not included in  
scenario or parameter uncertaintyDescribe the models, identify their published source, and identify
areas where they may deviate from real world conditions.

11.1 Introduction
This chapter outlines key requirements, steps, and procedures involved in quantifying
the GHG inventory results of the studied product necessary for public reporting.
