6.12.  Retrofitting of sea and coastal freight and passenger water transport  
Description of the activity  
Retrofit and upgrade of vessels designed and equipped for the transport of freight or passengers on sea or coastal
waters, and of vessels required for port operations and auxiliary activities, such as tugboats, mooring vessels, pilot
vessels, salvage vessels and ice-breakers.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE codes H50.10, H50.2, H52.22, C33.15,
N77.21 and N.77.34 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by
Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is a transitional activity as referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU)
2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. Until 31 December 2025, the retrofitting activity reduces fuel consumption of the vessel by at least 10 %
expressed in grams of fuel per deadweight tons per nautical mile, as demonstrated by computational fluid
dynamics (CFD), tank tests or similar engineering calculations.
2. Vessels are not dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Measures are in place to manage waste, both in the use phase and in the 
end-of-life of the vessel, in accordance with the waste hierarchy.
For battery-operated vessels, those measures include reuse and recycling of
batteries and electronics, including critical raw materials therein.
For existing ships above 500 gross tonnage and the new-built ones
replacing them, the activity complies with the requirements of Regulation
(EU) No 1257/2013 relating to the inventory of hazardous materials. The
scrap ships are recycled in facilities included on the European List of ship
recycling facilities as laid down in Commission Decision 2016/2323.
The activity complies with Directive (EU) 2019/883 as regards the
protection of the marine environment against the negative effects from
discharges of waste from ships.
The ship is operated in accordance with Annex V to the IMO MARPOL
Convention, in particular with a view to producing reduced quantities of
waste and to reducing legal discharges, by managing its waste in a
sustainable and environmentally sound manner.
