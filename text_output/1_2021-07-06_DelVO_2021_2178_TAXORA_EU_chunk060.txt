(iv) GAR on total financing in non-financial undertakings (lending plus equity holdings)
The three ratios for each environmental objective shall be disclosed based on turnover KPI and, for debt securities and
equity holdings, based on turnover KPI and CapEx KPI of underlying assets at an aggregate level for all financing
on-balance sheet instruments, including equity holdings, in non-financial undertakings.
The numerator and denominator of the ratios shall contain the gross carrying amount of loans and advances, debt
securities and equity holdings relevant in each case.
1.2.1.2. Green asset ratio for lending activities to and equity holdings of financial undertakings
GAR for lending activities to equity holdings of financial undertakings shall be calculated as a proportion of loans and
advances, debt securities and equity holdings of relevant accounting portfolios financing taxonomy-aligned economic activities for each environmental objective, compared to total loans and advances, debt securities and equity holdings of
financial undertakings.
This GAR shall contain disclosures for climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, with a breakdown for

financial undertakings to be considered in the numerator of the ratio shall be the sum of their gross carrying amount, weighted by the proportion of taxonomy-aligned economic activities with breakdown for transition, adaptation and
enabling activities for each counterparty.
Where the counterparty is another credit institution, the turnover-based and CapEx based KPIs used shall be the gross
carrying amount of debt securities, loans and advances and equity holdings of relevant accounting portfolios weighted by
the ‘Total GAR of the counterparty as defined in section’, that is gross carrying amount multiplied by ‘Total GAR’ of the counterparty.
Where the counterparty is an investment firm, the following calculation of the KPI shall apply based on the proportion of
the services in the income of the investment firm:
(a) for investment firms dealing on own account in accordance with Section A of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EU of the
