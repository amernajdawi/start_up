emissions intensity, i.e., emissions per unit of produc-tion output.
3)  It ensures transparency in reporting of indirect emis-
sions from T&D losses.
The formula to account for emissions associated with
T&D losses is the following:
In some countries such as Japan, local regulations may
require utility companies to provide both EFG and EFC toits consumers, and consumers may be required to use EFCto calculate indirect emissions from the consumption ofpurchased electricity. In this case, a company still needs touse EFG to report its scope 2 emissions for a GHG reportprepared in accordance with
GHG Protocol Corporate Standard .APPENDIX AEFC xELECTRICITY CONSUMED
