ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 15/1642.2. Urban waste water treatment
Description of the activity
Construction, extension, upgrade, operation and renewal of urban waste water infrastructure including treatment plants,
sewer networks, storm water management structures, connections to the waste water infrastructure, decentralised
wastewater treatment facilities, including individual and other appropriate systems, and discharge structures for treated
effluent. The activity may include innovative and advanced treatments, including the removal of micropollutants.
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E37.00 and F42.9, in
accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.
Technical screening criteria
Substantial contribution to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources
1.The waste water treatment system does not result in a deterioration of the good status and good ecological potential of
any of the affected water bodies and it contributes significantly to the achievement of good status and potential of the
affected water bodies, in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC (6).
The information related to the status of water bodies, to the activities potentially impacting the status and to the measures
taken to avoid or minimize such impacts, is included in a river basin management plan, or, for activities in third countries,
in an equivalent water use and protection management plan. The waste water treatment system fulfils the discharge
requirements set up by the competent local authorities. The waste water treatment system also contributes to achieve or
maintain the good environmental status of marine waters in accordance with Directive 2008/56/EC, where applicable.
2.The waste water treatment system has a collecting system and the provision of secondary treatment. The waste water
treatment system complies with the relevant, size-specific requirements for discharges from urban waste water treatment
plants set out in Directive 91/271/EEC, in particular Articles 3 to 8 and Article 13 of that Directive and Annex I to that
Directive.
3.Where the waste water treatment plant has a capacity of 100 000 population equivalent (p.e.) (7)or more, or of a daily
inflow of a five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) load of more than 6 000 kg, it uses a sludge treatment such as
anaerobic digestion or a technology with the same or a lower net energy demand (considering both energy generation and
consumption), to stabilise the sludge.
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)
(1) Climate change mitigation An assessment of the direct GHG emissions from the centralised waste water system,
including collection (sewer network) and treatment, has been performed. The results
are disclosed to investors and clients on demand (8).
For anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge, a monitoring plan is in place for methane
leakage at the facility.
(6)For activities in third countries, in accordance with applicable national law or international standards which pursue equivalent
objectives of good water status and good ecological potential, through equivalent procedural and substantive rules, i.e. a water use and
protection management plan developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders which ensures that (1) the impact of the activities
on the identified status or ecological potential of potentially affected water body or bodies is assessed; and (2) deterioration or
prevention of good status/ecological potential is avoided.
(7)Population equivalent (p.e.) means the organic biodegradable load having a five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) of 60 g of
oxygen per day.
(8)For example, in line with IPCC guidelines for national GHG inventories for waste water treatment, version of 27.6.2023 available at: https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/pdf/5_Volume5/19R_V5_6_Ch06_Wastewater.pdf.OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
