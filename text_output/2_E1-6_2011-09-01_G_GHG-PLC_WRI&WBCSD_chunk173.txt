[116]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard
See chapter 14 for more information on performance
tracking and setting reduction targets.
Consumer and business purchasing decisions, quantitative
product labeling, and performance claims:
•The unit of analysis should be identical
•The system boundaries and temporal boundary should
be equivalent
•The same allocation methods should be used for
similar processes
•The data types used and the data quality and
uncertainty of data should be reported and assessed to
determine if a fair comparison can be made
•The temporal and geographical representativeness of
the inventories should be assessed to determine if a
fair comparison can be made
•Third party assurance should be performed
ISO labels and declarations:
•Environmental Labels (Type I)1, Self-declared
Environmental Claims (Type II)2, Environmental Product
Declarations (Type III)3, and comparative assertions4
should meet the accounting and communication
requirements of the respective standardsA.1 Role of product rules
Product rules provide additional specifications that enable
valid comparisons of two or more products. Product rules
may vary in quality. When developing a new product
rule or evaluating the quality of an existing product rule
before use, criteria to consider include whether:
•The rule is developed by a diverse group of
stakeholders with relevant subject matter expertise
•The rule is peer-reviewed by qualified experts
 •There are safeguards in place to prevent conflict  
of interest
•The rules apply internationally so they can be adopted
by other programs and policies
•A policy is in place to determine when product rules
are updated
