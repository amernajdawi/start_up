(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  N/A  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Measures are in place to manage waste, both in the use phase and in the 
end-of-life of the vessel, in accordance with the waste hierarchy.
For battery-operated vessels, those measures include reuse and recycling of
batteries and electronics, including critical raw materials therein.
For existing ships above 500 gross tonnage and the new-built ones
replacing them, the activity complies with the requirement of Regulation
(EU) No 1257/2013 relating to the inventory of hazardous materials. The
scrap ships are recycled in facilities included on the European List of ship
recycling facilities as laid down in Commission Decision 2016/2323.
The activity complies with Directive (EU) 2019/883 as regards the
protection of the marine environment against the negative effects from
discharges of waste from ships
The ship is operated in accordance with Annex V to the IMO MARPOL
Convention, in particular with a view to producing reduced quantities of
waste and to reducing legal discharges, by managing its waste in a
sustainable and environmentally sound manner.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  As regards the reduction of sulphur oxides emissions and particulate 
matters, vessels comply with Directive (EU) 2016/802 and with Regulation
14 of Annex VI to the IMO MARPOL Convention. Sulphur in fuel content
does not exceed 0,5 % in mass (the global sulphur limit) and 0,1 % in
mass in emission control area (ECA) designated in the North and Baltic
Seas by the IMO (  522  ). 
As regards nitrogen oxides (NO  x ) emissions, vessels comply with Regu ­
lation 13 of Annex VI to the IMO MARPOL Convention. Tier II NO  x 
requirement applies to ships constructed after 2011. Only while
operating in NO  x emission control areas established under IMO rules, 
ships constructed after 1 January 2016 comply with stricter engine
requirements (Tier III) reducing NO  x emissions (  523  ).
