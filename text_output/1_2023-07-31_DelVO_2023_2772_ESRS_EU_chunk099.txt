ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 100/284(g) disclose the extent to which the undertaking’s Scope 3 GHG emissions are measured using inputs from specific
activities within the entity’s upstream and downstream value chain, and disclose the percentage of emissions
calculated using primary data obtained from suppliers or other value chain partners.
(h) for each significant Scope 3 GHG category, disclose the reporting boundaries considered, the calculation
methods for estimating the GHG emissions as well as if and which calculation tools were applied. The Scope
3 categories should be consistent with the GHGP and include:
i. indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions from the consolidated accounting group (the parent and its subsidiaries),
ii. indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions from associates, joint ventures, and unconsolidated subsidiaries for which
the undertaking has the ability to control the operational activities and relationships (i.e., operational
control),
iii. Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions from associates, joint ventures, unconsolidated subsidiaries (investment
entities) and joint arrangements for which the undertaking does not have operational control and when
these entities are part of the undertaking’s upstream and dopwnstream value chain.
(i) disclose a list of Scope 3 GHG emissions categories included in and excluded from the inventory with a
justification for excluded Scope 3 categories;
(j) disclose biogenic emissions of CO 2 from the combustion or biodegradation of biomass that occur in its
upstream and downstream value chain separately from the gross Scope 3 GHG emissions, and include
emissions of other types of GHG (such as CH 4 and N2O), and emissions of CO2 that occur in the life cycle of
biomass other than from combustion or biodegradation (such as GHG emissions from processing or
transporting biomass) in the calculation of Scope 3 GHG emissions;
(k) not include any removals, or any purchased, sold or transferred carbon credits or GHG allowances in the
calculation of Scope 3 GHG emissions;
AR 47. When preparing the information on the total GHG emissions required under paragraph 52, the undertaking shall:
(a) apply the following formulas to calculate the total GHG emissions:
(b) disclose total GHG emissions with a distinction between emissions derived from the location-based and
market-based methods applied while measuring the underlying Scope 2 GHG emissions.
AR 48. The undertaking shall disclose its total GHG emissions disaggregated by Scopes 1 and 2 and significant Scope 3 in
accordance with the table below.
