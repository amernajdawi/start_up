ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 273/284Metrics Qualitative and quantitative indicators that the undertaking uses to measure
and report on the effectiveness of the delivery of its sustainability-related
policies and against its targets over time. Metrics also support the
measurement of the undertaking’s results in respect of affected people, the environment and the undertaking.
Microplastics Small pieces of plastics, usually smaller than 5mm. A growing volume of
microplastics is found in the environment, including the sea, and in food
and drinking water. Once in the environment, microplastics do not
biodegrade and tend to accumulate, unless they are specifically designed to
biodegrade in the open environment. Biodegradability is a complex
phenomenon, especially in the marine environment. There are increasing
concerns about the presence of microplastics in different environment
compartments (such as water), their impact on the environment and potentially human health.
Minimum Disclosure Requirement A minimum disclosure requirement sets the required content of the
information that the undertaking includes when it reports on policies, actions, metrics or targets, either pursuant to a Disclosure Requirement in
an ESRS or on an entity-specific basis.
Natural resources Natural assets (raw materials) occurring in nature that can be used for
economic production or consumption.
Nature-based solutions Actions to protect, conserve, restore, sustainably use and manage natural or
modified terrestrial, freshwater , coastal and marine ecosystems which
address social, economic and environmental challenges effectively and
adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being, ecosystem
services, resilience and biodiversity benefits.
Net-zero target Setting a net-zero target at the level of an undertaking aligned with meeting
societal climate goals means:
i.achieving a scale of value chain emissions reductions consistent with the
abatement required to reach global net-zero in 1.5°C pathways; and
ii.neutralizing the impact of any residual emissions (after approximately
90-95% of GHG emission reduction with the possibility for justified
sectoral variations in line with a recognized sectoral pathway) by permanently removing an equivalent volume of CO2.
Non-employees Non-employees in an undertaking’s own workforce include both individual
contractors supplying labour to the undertaking (“self-employed people”) and people provided by undertakings primarily engaged in “employment
activities” (NACE Code N78).
Non-renewable energy Energy which cannot be identified as being derived from renewable sources.
Operational control Operational control (over an entity, site, operation or asset) is the situation
where the undertaking has the ability to direct the operational activities and
