54. The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to provide insight into the undertaking’s approach to employment,
including the scope and nature of impacts arising from its employment practices, to provide contextual information
that aids the understanding of the information reported in other disclosures, and to serve as the basis for calculation
for quantitative metrics to be disclosed under other disclosure requirements in this Standard. It also allows an
understanding of how much the undertaking relies on non-employees as part of its workforce.
55. The disclosure required by paragraph 53 shall include:
(a) a disclosure of the total number of non-employees in the undertaking’s own workforce, i.e., either people with
contracts with the undertaking to supply labour (“self-employed people”) or people provided by undertakings
primarily engaged in “employment activities” (NACE Code N78).OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
