1. The objective of European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) is to specify the sustainability information that
an undertaking shall disclose in accordance with Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the
Council (1), as amended by Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council. (2)Reporting
in accordance with ESRS does not exempt undertakings from other obligations laid down in Union law.
2. Specifically, ESRS specify the information that an undertaking shall disclose about its material impacts, risks and
opportunities in relation to environmental, social, and governance sustainability matters. ESRS do not require
undertakings to disclose any information on environmental, social and governance topics covered by ESRS when the
undertaking has assessed the topic in question as non-material (See Appendix E of this Standard “Flowchart for
determining disclosures to be included”).The information disclosed in accordance with ESRS enables users of the
sustainability statement to understand the undertaking’s material impacts on people and environment and the
material effects of sustainability matters on the undertaking’s development, performance and position.
3. The objective of this Standard (ESRS 1) is to provide an understanding of the architecture of ESRS, the drafting
conventions and fundamental concepts used, and the general requirements for preparing and presenting
sustainability information in accordance with Directive 2013/34/EU, as amended by Directive (EU) 2022/2464.
1. Categories of ESRS Standards, reporting areas and drafting conventions
1.1 Categories of ESRS standards
4. There are three categories of ESRS:
(a) cross-cutting standards;
(b) topical standards (Environmental, Social and Governance standards); and
(c) sector-specific standards.
Cross-cutting standards and topical standards are sector-agnostic, meaning that they apply to all undertakings
regardless of which sector or sectors the undertaking operates in.
5. The cross-cutting standards ESRS 1 General requirements and ESRS 2 General disclosures apply to the sustainability
matters covered by topical standards and sector-specific standards.
6. This standard (ESRS 1) describes the architecture of ESRS standards, explains drafting conventions and fundamental
concepts, and sets out general requirements for preparing and presenting sustainability-related information.
7. ESRS 2 establishes Disclosure Requirements on the information that the undertaking shall provide at a general level
across all material sustainability matters on the reporting areas governance, strategy , impact, risk and opportunity
management, and metrics and targets.
8. Topical ESRS cover a sustainability topic and are structured into topics and sub-topics, and where necessary sub-sub- topics. The table in Application Requirement 16 (AR 16) to this standard provides an overview of the sustainability
topics, sub-topics and sub-sub-topics (collectively ‘sustainability matters ’) covered by topical ESRS.
