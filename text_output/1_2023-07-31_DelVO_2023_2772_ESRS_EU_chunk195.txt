ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 195/284AR 87. Health issues resulting, for example, from smoking, drug and alcohol abuse, physical inactivity, unhealthy diets,
and psychosocial factors unrelated to work are not considered work-related.
AR 88. Occupational diseases are not considered work-related injuries but are covered under work-related ill health.
Guidance on computing the rate of work-related injuries
AR 89. In computing the rate of work-related injuries, the undertaking shall divide the respective number of cases by the
number of total hours worked by people in its own workforce and multiplied by 1 000 000. Thereby, these rates
represent the number of respective cases per one million hours worked. A rate based on 1 000 000 hours worked
indicates the number of work-related injuries per 500 full time people in the workforce over a 1-year timeframe. For comparability purposes a rate based on 1 000 000 hours worked shall be used also for undertakings with less
than 500 people in the workforce.
AR 90. If the undertaking cannot directly calculate the number of hours worked, it may estimate this on the basis of
normal or standard hours of work, taking into account entitlements to periods of paid leave of absence from
work (for example, paid vacations, paid sick leave, public holidays) and explain this in its disclosures.
AR 91. An undertaking shall include fatalities as a result of work-related injury in the calculation of the number and rate
of recordable work-related injuries.
Guidance on recordable work-related ill health
AR 92. Work-related ill health can include acute, recurring, and chronic health problems caused or aggravated by work
conditions or practices. These include musculoskeletal disorders, skin and respiratory diseases, malignant
cancers, diseases caused by physical agents (for example, noise-induced hearing loss, vibration-caused diseases),
and mental illnesses (for example, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder). For the purpose of the required
disclosures, the undertaking shall, at a minimum, include in its disclosure those cases outlined in the ILO List of
Occupational Diseases.
AR 93. In the context of this Standard, work-related musculoskeletal disorders are covered under work-related ill health
(and not injuries).
AR 94. The cases to be disclosed in paragraph 88(d) relate to cases of work-related ill health notified to the undertaking or identified by the undertaking through medical surveillance, during the reporting period. The undertaking
might be notified of cases of work-related ill health through reports by affected people, compensation agencies,
or healthcare professionals. The disclosure may include cases of work-related ill health that were detected during
the reporting period among people who were formerly in the undertaking’s workforce.
Guidance on the number of days lost
AR 95. The undertaking shall count the number of days lost such that the first full day and last day of absence shall be
included. Calendar days should be considered for the calculation, thus days on which the affected individual is
not scheduled for work (for example, weekends, public holidays) will count as lost days.
Disclosure Requirement S1-15 – Work-life balance
AR 96. Family-related leave include maternity leave, paternity leave, parental leave, and carers’ leave that is available
under national law or collective agreements. For the purpose of this Standard, these concepts are defined as:
(a) maternity leave (also called pregnancy leave): employment-protected leave of absence for employed women
directly around the time of childbirth (or, in some countries, adoption);OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
