ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 153/284(c) the plans and capacity of the undertaking to adapt its strategy and business model in line with circular economy
principles including but not limited to minimising waste
, maintaining the value of products, materials and other
resources at their highest value and enhancing their efficient use in production and consumption;
(d) the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities related to the undertaking’s
impacts and dependencies, arising from resource use and circular economy, and how the undertaking manages
them; and
(e) the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and
opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on resource use and circular economy.
2. This Standard sets out Disclosure Requirements related to “resource use” and “circular economy” and in particular on:
(a) resource inflows including the circularity of material resource inflows, considering renewable and non-
renewable resources; and
(b) resource outflows including information on products and materials; and
(c) waste.
3. Circular economy means an economic system in which the value of products, materials and other resources in the
economy is maintained for as long as possible, enhancing their efficient use in production and consumption, thereby
reducing the environmental impact of their use, minimising waste and the release of hazardous substances at all
stages of their life cycle, including through the application of the waste hierarchy . The goal is to maximise and
maintain the value of the technical and biological resources, products and materials by creating a system that allows
for durability , optimal use or re-use, refurbishment, remanufacturing, recycling and nutrient cycling.
4. This Standard builds on relevant EU legislative frameworks and policies including the EU Circular Economy Action
Plan, Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (83)(Waste Framework Directive) and the
EU industrial strategy.
5. To evaluate the transition from business as usual, meaning an economy in which finite resources are extracted to make products that are used and then thrown away (“take-make-waste”), to a circular economic system, this
Standard relies on the identification of the physical flows of resources, materials and products used and generated by
the undertaking through Disclosure Requirement E5-4 Resource inflows and Disclosure Requirement E5-5 Resource
outflows.
Interactions with other ESRS
6. Resource use is a major driver of other environmental impacts such as climate change, pollution, water and marine
resources and biodiversity. A circular economy is a system that tends towards sustainable use of resources in
extraction, processing, production, consumption and management of waste. Such system brings multiple
environmental benefits, in particular, the reduction of material and energy consumption and emissions into the air
(greenhouse gas emissions or other pollution), the limitation of water withdrawals and discharges and the
regeneration of nature limiting the impact on biodiversity.
7. To provide a comprehensive overview of which other environmental matters could be material to resource use and
circular economy, relevant disclosure requirements are covered in other environmental ESRS as follows:
(a) ESRS E1 Climate change, which addresses, in particular, GHG emissions and energy resources (energy
consumption);
(b) ESRS E2 Pollution, which addresses, in particular, emissions to water, air and soil as well as substances of concern;
(83)Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives
