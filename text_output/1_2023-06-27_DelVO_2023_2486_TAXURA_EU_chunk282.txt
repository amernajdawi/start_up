ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 103/164The tracking system in place in the installations based on the best practices referred to above allows the monitoring of:
(a) the effective separation of each part of a product or waste such as waste equipment, containing or contaminated with
POP above the levels defined in Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2019/1021;
(b) the effective destruction or irreversible transformation of the POP waste in compliance with Articles 7(2) – 7(4) and
Annex V to Regulation (EU) 2019/1021.
6.For the treatment of mercury-containing waste (54), all installations likely to treat waste consisting of, containing or
contaminated with mercury or mercury compounds (as defined in Article 11 of the Minamata Convention), implement
the traceability system set out in Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2017/852 or a similar traceability system. Based on this
tracking system, the installations treating mercury-containing waste monitor the effective safe fate of mercury and
mercury compounds in appropriate final destination.
7.For the (non-combustion) treatment of healthcare waste, the installation implements the best practices set out in the
WHO handbook on safe management of wastes from healthcare activities (55).
A non-combustion healthcare waste installation has specific acceptance procedure, monitors and can prove that the
following types of healthcare waste are not accepted for treatment:
(a) cytotoxic waste;
(b) pharmaceutical waste;
(c) chemical waste;
(d) radioactive waste.
The technologies used are certified by an independent certification body.
