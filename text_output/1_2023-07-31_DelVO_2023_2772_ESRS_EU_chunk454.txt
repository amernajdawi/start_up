AR 67. The employees in the undertaking’s own workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements are those
individuals to whom the undertaking is obliged to apply the agreement. This means that if none of the
employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the percentage reported is zero. An employee in the
undertaking’s own workforce covered by more than one collective bargaining agreement only needs to be
counted once.
AR 68. This requirement is not aimed at obtaining the percentage of employees represented by a works council or
belonging to trade unions, which can be different. The percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining
agreements can be higher than the percentage of unionised employees when the collective bargaining agreements
apply to both union and non-union members. Alternatively, the percentage of employees covered by collective
bargaining agreements can be lower than the percentage of unionised employees. This may be the case when
there are no collective bargaining agreements available or when the collective bargaining agreements do not
cover all unionised employees.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
