Chapter 6:  
Establishing  
the Scope• Choosing a studied product (in sector guidance)

• Identifying any additional GHGs that are applicable to the product or sector
Chapter 7:  
Boundary Setting• Life cycle stage definitions and descriptions
• Specific attributable processes
• Relevant non-attributable processes
• Justified excluded attributable processes (including insignificance threshold)
• Use and end-of-life profiles
• Time period
• Method used to calculate land-use change impacts
Chapter 8:  
Collecting Data and
Assessing Data Quality• Type of primary data to collect for processes under the reporting company’s control

data should be collected
• Secondary data sources and default data values

Chapter 10:  
Assessing Uncertainty• Default uncertainty values

Inventory Results• The GWP values to use

Chapter 12:  
Assurance• The type of assurance to perform
Chapter 13:  
Reporting• Optional reporting elements that would be beneficial to stakeholders

While using product rules and sector guidance is not
required for conformance with this standard, each provides
