ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 150/284judgment can be used where data gaps exist. The methodology shall be sufficiently detailed to allow for meaningful
comparison of impacts and mitigation activities over time. Information gathering processes and definitions must
be systematically applied. This enables a meaningful review of the undertaking’s performance over time and helps
internal and peer comparison.
AR 29. If a metric corresponds to a target, the baseline for both shall be aligned. The biodiversity baseline is an essential
component of the larger biodiversity and ecosystems management process. The baseline is necessary to inform
impact assessment and management planning, as well as monitoring and adaptive management.
AR 30. Methodologies available to collect data and measure the undertakings’ impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems
may be separated into three categories as follows:
(a) primary data: collected in-situ using on the ground surveys;
(b) secondary data: including geospatial data layers that are overlaid with geographic location data of business
activities.
i.At the species level, data layers on the ranges of different species can be used to predict the species that may
be present at different locations. This includes operation sites and sourcing locations. Different range layers
will have different levels of accuracy depending on certain factors (e.g., whether species ranges have been
refined based on availability of habitat
). Information on the threat status of the species, and the activities
that threaten them, can provide an indication of the likely contribution that business activities may be having on driving population trends and threat status.
ii.At the ecosystem level, data layers reflecting change in the extent and condition of ecosystems can be
applied, including levels of habitat fragmentation and connectivity.
(c) modelled biodiversity state data: Model-based approaches are commonly used for measuring ecosystem level indicators (e.g., extent, condition, or function). Models quantify how the magnitude of different pressures
affects the state of biodiversity. These are referred to as pressure-state relationships and are based on globally
collected data. Modelling results are applied locally to estimate how undertaking-level pressures will cause
changes in ecosystem condition.An impact driver generally has three main characteristics: magnitude (e.g.,
amount of contaminant, noise intensity), spatial extent (e.g., area of land contaminated) and temporal extent
(duration of persistence of contaminant).
AR 31. With regard to life cycle assessment for land-use, the undertaking may refer to the “Land-use related environmental
indicators for Life Cycle Assessment” by the Joint Research Center.
AR 32. With regard to the introduction of invasive alien species, the undertaking may disclose the pathways and number
of invasive alien species and the extent of surface covered by invasive alien species.
AR 33. With regard to metrics on the extent and condition of ecosystems, useful guidance can be found in the work of the
United Nations System of Environmental Economic Accounting Ecosystem Accounting (UN SEEA EA).
AR 34. The undertaking may disclose in units of area (e.g., m2 or ha) on land-use using guidance provided by the Eco-
Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) (
82):
(a) total use of land;
(b) total sealed area;
(c) total nature-oriented area on site; and
(d) total nature-oriented area off site.
