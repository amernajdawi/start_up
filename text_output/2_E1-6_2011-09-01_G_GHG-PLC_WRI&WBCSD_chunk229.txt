4.  Determine type of land converted
Malaysia has a tropical climate, and according to statistics
the majority of land is forest (66 percent) or cropland  
(31 percent).13 Therefore, it should be assumed that
the land-use change occurred from tropical forest to
cropland to meet the increased demand for palm oil fruit.
Companies can use the IPCC default values to determine
what the carbon stock change associated with this land-
use change would be. The company also needs to assume
what the land-use change practices would typically be
when forest land is converted to cropland in Malaysia â€“
for example, whether the forest biomass is burned during
conversion and what fertilizers are applied to prepare the
land for crop production.
In some cases identifying the type of land converted may
not be as straightforward. In such cases, companies should perform a scenario uncertainty analysis to show
the impact of different assumptions. For example, if a
crop is being produced in a country with tropical forest
land and grassland that could be converted, companies
should assume the tropical forest is being converted and
use grassland conversion for an uncertainty calculation.
5.  Distribute land-use change impacts
