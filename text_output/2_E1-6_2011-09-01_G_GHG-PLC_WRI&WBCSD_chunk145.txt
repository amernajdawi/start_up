of applications such as fibers, fabrics, filaments, and
engineering resins. Because of the range of functions
and products Sorona® can be used for, DuPont
performed a cradle-to-gate inventory. However, the
resulting fate of the carbon in the molecule is an
important evaluation for any cradle-to-grave inventory
that uses Sorona® as a material input. To ensure
that downstream customers have all the necessary
information to perform a cradle-to-grave assessment,
DuPont included in the inventory report the amount
of carbon (fossil and biogenic) contained within the
product as it leaves the cradle-to-gate inventory
boundary. DuPont also has information on the fate of
the contained carbon in different end-of-life scenarios
that they included in the inventory report separate
from the cradle-to-gate inventory results as optional
information to help downstream customers define
their end-of-life profiles.DuPontTM
