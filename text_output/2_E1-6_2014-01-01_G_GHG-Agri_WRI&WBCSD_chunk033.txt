 Describes criteria that are useful in selecting specific calculation tools .  Describes common sources of uncertainty in calculating GHG data that offer opportunities for improving inventory quality . Calculation approach GHG flux data Activity data : Data on farm production ( e . g . , number of livestock grown ) Data on environmental factors ( e . g . , soil type , climate , and weather ) Data on farm inputs ( e . g . , amount of fertilizer used ) - - - Page 47 of 103 - - - GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance

Summary of requirements and main recommendations:
 When high-quality activity da ta are not available for a ll of the emissions sources
that need to be included in an invent ory, companies should prioritize their data
collection efforts based on source magnitude.
 Companies should select a calculation appr oach that best meets their objectives
for compiling an inventory and the GHG accounting and reporting principles.
 When managing inventory quality, companies should focus on reducing
parameter uncertainty.
 Information on GHG data uncertainty s hould be reported in inventories.  
Note: Prior to calculating GHG fluxes, comp anies should also consult Chapter 8, which
details the specific types of C stock changes that should be included in an inventory and
for which calculations are therefore recommended.   

7.1 Collecting activity data

Activity data can often be collected from ex isting data records held by producers, such
as: invoices, electricity meters, crop insurance records, field records of tractor passes and
crop operations, production records, land registry  records, nutrient management plans, 
and livestock movement records. To the extent  possible, these record s should be used to 
reduce the GHG reporting burden and improve the a udit trail. In general, data on energy
consumption, procurement and production leve ls can often be obtained from high quality
sources. In contrast, reliable data on land ma nagement practices and LUC can be more
difficult to obtain. Table 7-1 summarizes common types of required activity data.
Companies should consult individual calculatio n tools to determine their exact data
requirements. It is recommended that larg e operations with geographically separated
facilities should standardize inventory procedures and keep central records.

Common challenges
Certain challenges are commonly encountered when collecting activity data (Table 7-2).
Companies should be mindful of these ch allenges when designing inventories and
inventory quality management plans.
