risk to be a climate-related physical risk or climate-related transition risk .
19. The undertaking shall describe the resilience of its strategy and business model in relation to climate change. This
description shall include:

Disclosure requirement related to ESRS 2 IRO-1 – Description of the processes to identify and assess material climate-
related impacts, risks and opportunities
20. The undertaking shall describe the process to identify and assess climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities.
This description shall include its process in relation to:
(a) impacts on climate change, in particular, the undertaking’s GHG emissions (as required by Disclosure
Requirement ESRS E1-6);
(b) climate-related physical risks in own operations and along the upstream and downstream value chain, in

related hazards, creating gross physical risks for the undertaking.
(c) climate-related transition risks and opportunities in own operations and along the upstream and downstream
value chain, in particular:
