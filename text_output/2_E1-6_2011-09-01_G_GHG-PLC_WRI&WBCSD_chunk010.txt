guidance
This chapter provides a summary of the steps involved in product accounting and
reporting, as well as a list of the requirements that must be followed for a product
inventory to be in conformance with this standard.
3.1 Standard terminology
This standard uses precise language to indicate which
provisions of the standard are requirements, which
are recommendations, and which are permissible or
allowable options that companies may choose to follow.
The term “shall” is used in this standard to indicate what
is required for a GHG inventory to conform with the
Product Standard. The term “should”  is used to indicate 
a recommendation, but not a requirement. The term “may”  is used to indicate an option that is permissible 
or allowable. Within the guidance sections, the term
“required”  is used to refer to  “shall” statements given 
elsewhere in the standard. Also within the guidance
sections, “needs,” “can,” or “cannot”  are sometimes used 
to provide guidance on implementing a requirement or  
to indicate when an action is or is not possible. Summary of Steps and Requirements
