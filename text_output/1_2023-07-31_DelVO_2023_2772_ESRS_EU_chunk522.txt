(b) in the case of material negative impacts, whether they are either (i) widespread or systemic in contexts where the
undertaking operates or has sourcing or other business relationships (for example, marginalised populations
suffering impacts on their health and quality of life in a highly industrialised area), or (ii) related to individual
incidents in the undertaking’s own operations (e.g., a toxic waste spill affecting a community’s access to clean
drinking water) or in a specific business relationship (e.g., a peaceful protest by communities against business operations that was met with a violent response from the undertaking’s security services). This includes consideration of impacts on affected communities that may arise from the transition to greener and climate-
neutral operations. Potential impacts include impacts associated with innovation and restructuring, closure of
mines, increased mining of minerals needed for the transition to a sustainable economy and solar panel
production;
(c) in the case of material positive impacts, a brief description of the activities that result in the positive impacts (for
example, capacity-building to support more and new forms of local livelihoods) and the types of communities
that are positively affected or could be positively affected; the undertaking may also disclose whether the
positive impacts occur in specific countries or regions; and
(d) any material risks and opportunities for the business arising from impacts and dependencies on affected
communities.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
