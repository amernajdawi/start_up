Reductions in indirect emissions
Reductions in indirect emissions (changes in scope 2 or 3emissions over time) may not always capture the actualemissions reduction accurately. This is because there isnot always a direct cause-effect relationship between theactivity of the reporting company and the resulting GHGemissions. For example, a reduction in air travel wouldreduce a company’s scope 3 emissions. This reduction isusually quantified based on an average emission factorof fuel use per passenger. However, how this reductionactually translates into a change in GHG emissions tothe atmosphere would depend on a number of factors,including whether another person takes the “empty seat”or whether this unused seat contributes to reduced airtraffic over the longer term. Similarly, reductions in scope 2 emissions calculated with an average gridemissions factor may over- or underestimate the actualreduction depending on the nature of the grid.
Generally, as long as the accounting of indirect emissions
over time recognizes activities that in aggregate changeglobal emissions, any such concerns over accuracyshould not inhibit companies from reporting their indi-rect emissions. In cases where accuracy is moreimportant, it may be appropriate to undertake a moreCHAPTER 8 Accounting for GHG Reductions 59GUIDANCE
