ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 97/164The maximum solvents loss from total inputs does not exceed a 3 % loss. Total volatile organic compound (VOC) recovery
efficiency is at least 99 %.
The operator verifies that no fugitive VOC emission occurs beyond the criteria specified below as to the parts per million
volumetric (ppmv) thresholds by carrying out Leak detection and repair (LDAR) campaigns, at least every 3 years.
Investments for the use of high integrity equipment are recommended, provided that these are installed in existing plants
for cases mentioned under BAT 23b of the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste gas
management and treatment systems in the chemical sector, whereas the pressure threshold is brought to 200 bar. The
minimal verification schedule may be reduced in cases where quantification of total VOC emissions from the plant is
periodically qualified with tracer correlation (TC) or with optical absorption-based techniques, such as differential
absorption light detection and ranging (DIAL) or solar occultation flux (SOX) or other measures of equivalent performance.
Diffuse emissions of substances or mixtures classified as CMR1A or 1B from leaky equipment do not exceed a
concentration of 100 ppmv (34).
The LDAR campaigns have the features described in BAT19 of the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste gas management and treatment systems in the chemical sector, which include detecting, repairing and maintaining
leaks within 30 days of detection and a leak threshold is lower than or equal to 5 000 ppmv for substances or mixtures
other than those classified as CMR 1A or 1B, which are reviewed and updated for the continuous improvement of the installation. Solvent losses and recovery efficiency of VOC are monitored based on a solvent management plan using a
mass balance for verification of compliance, in accordance with Chapter V of Directive 2010/75/EU.
2.4. Sewage, refuse, and other waste (including solids, liquids, or gaseous by-products from manufacturing) are disposed of
in a safe, timely, and sanitary manner. Containers or pipes for waste material are clearly identified. Analytical data
demonstrating the conversion of these substances and their residues to non-hazardous waste materials are available at the
facility and kept up to date.
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)
(1) Climate change mitigation Where the activity involves on-site generation of heat/cool or co-generation including
power, the direct GHG emissions of the activity are lower than 270 gCO
2e/kWh.
For the refrigerant threshold, the Global Warming Potential does not exceed 150 in cooling of the substance.
Where medicinal products are made from substances listed in Sections 3.10 to 3.16 of
Annex II to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139, the GHG emissions do not exceed
the limits set out in their respective technical screening criteria for DNSH to climate
change mitigation.
The substitution does not lead to an increment of lifecycle GHG emissions. Lifecycle
GHG emissions are calculated using Recommendation 2013/179/EU or, alternatively,
using ISO 14067:2018 (
35)or ISO 14064-1:2018 (36). Quantified life-cycle GHG
emissions are verified by an independent third party.
(34)Where the exemption under criterion 1.3 applies.
