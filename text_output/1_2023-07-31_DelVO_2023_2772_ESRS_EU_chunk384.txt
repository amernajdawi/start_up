ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 166/2842. In order to meet the objective, this Standard also requires an explanation of the general approach the undertaking
takes to identify and manage any material actual and potential impacts on its own workforce in relation to the
following social, including human rights, factors or matters:
(a) working conditions, including:
i. secure employment;
ii. working time;
iii. adequate wages;
iv. social dialogue;
v. freedom of association, the existence of works councils and the information, consultation and participation
rights of workers;
vi. collective bargaining, including the rate of the undertaking’s workforce covered by collective agreements;
vii. work-life balance; and
viii. health and safety.
(b) equal treatment and opportunities for all, including:
i. gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value;
ii. training and skills development;
iii. employment and inclusion of persons with disabilities;
iv. measures against violence and harassment in the workplace; and
v. diversity.
(c) other work-related rights, including those that relate to:
i. child labour;
ii. forced labour;
iii. adequate housing; and
iv. privacy.

qualified labour and harm its reputation. Conversely, policies to increase the representation of women in the
workforce and in upper levels of management can have positive effects, such as increasing the pool of qualified
labour and improving the undertaking’s reputation.
4. This Standard covers an undertaking’s own workforce, which is understood to include both people who are in an
employment relationship with the undertaking (“employees”) and non-employees who are either people with
contracts with the undertaking to supply labour (“self-employed people”) or people provided by undertakings
primarily engaged in “employment activities” (NACE Code N78). See Application Requirement 3 for examples of
who falls under own workforce. The information required to be disclosed with regard to non-employees shall not
affect their status pursuant to applicable labour law.
5. This Standard does not cover workers in the undertaking’s upstream or downstream value chain; these categories of
