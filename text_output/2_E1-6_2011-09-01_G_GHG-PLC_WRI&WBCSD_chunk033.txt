CHAPTER 07 Boundary Setting
guidanceGE performed a GHG inventory of their GE Energy 2.5xl
wind turbine, with the unit of analysis defined as the
quantity of electricity delivered to the grid by one 2.5xl
wind turbine over its 20-year lifetime. Using the general
life cycle stages defined by this standard, GE developed
a process map to reflect how the various materials and
activities should be categorized within the life cycle. The
wind turbine contains over 10,000 parts, so the material
acquisition and preprocessing stage processes were simplified to include only the main material inputs
while still giving an idea of the magnitude compared
to other stages. The production stage includes sub-
assembly of various turbine components. The use stage
includes operation and maintenance (O&M) that occurs
over the 20 years the wind turbine is in operation,
including any related transportation to the installation
site. The end-of-life stage includes decommissioning
(disassembly of turbine) and recycling or disposal of the
turbine materials.GE
NOTE: The upstream and downstream material and energy inputs are not identified in this process map for simplicity.  
The results of this inventory showed that 65 percent of the life cycle GHG emissions occur in the material acquisition
and preprocessing stage. Including the process map in the inventory report will allow GEâ€™s stakeholders to have a visual
understanding of not only the life cycle processes attributable to a wind turbine but also the inventory results. material acquisition
