. g . , metric tonnes C / ha ) at two points in time ; or  The net balance of CO 2 emissions and CO 2 removals ( ‘ net fluxes ’ ) to or from a stock , measured in units of mass of CO 2 .

Both approaches are equally valid. Under ei ther, companies should take care to use
methods that treat soil depth consistently, particularly in the context of LUC. For
instance, reference stock values might be available for soil C stocks in forest and

cropland - if these are not de fined to a consistent depth10, some of the estimated stock
difference will reflect methodological differe nces rather than actual variation.
While companies should report net CO
2 flux data, they may also report data on stock size
(when available) to provide us eful context for interpreting inventory results. Stock size
data can be converted to net flux data by multiplying the mass of stock change by ସସ
ଵଶ,
which is the ratio of th e molecular weights of CO 2 and elemental carbon.  

Companies  should use peer-reviewed methods for CO 2 flux calculations 
This Guidance does not prescribe speci fic methodologies for calculating the CO 2 fluxes
to/from C stocks. Any of the general approach es detailed in Chapter 7.3 may be used, as
long as the underlying methodology has been scientifically vetted (i.e., has undergone
peer review). Appendix III lists many, scie ntifically published and well established
calculation tools for estimating CO 2 fluxes.
