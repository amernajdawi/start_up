(31) An economic activity can contr ibut e substantially to the environmental objective of the protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems, in several ways, including by protecting, conser ving or restoring biodiversity and
ecosystems , and thereby enhancing ecosystem services. Such services are grouped into four categor ies, namely
provisionin g services, such as the provisioning of food and wate r; regulating services, such as the control of climat e
and disease; suppor ting services, such as nutr ient cycles and oxygen production; and cultural services, such as
provid ing spiritual and recreational benefits.
(32) For the purposes of this Regulation, the term ‘sustainable forest manage ment ’ should be constr ued by taking into
account practices and uses of forests and forest land that contr ibut e to enhancing biodiversity or to halting or
preventing the degradation of ecosystem s, deforestation and habitat loss, by taking into account the stewardsh ip
and use of forests and forest land in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity , productivity , rege neration
capacity , vitality and their poten tial to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social
functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems, as set out in
Resolution H1 of the Second Minist erial Conf erence on the Prote ction of Forests in Europe of 16–17 June 1993 in
Helsinki on General Guidelines for the Sustainable Managem ent of Forests in Europe as well as by taking into
account Regulations (EU) No 995/2010 and (EU) 2018/841 (46) of the European Parliament and of the Council and
Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (47) and the communication of the
Commission of 20 Sept ember 2013 on ‘A new EU Forest Strateg y: for forests and the forest-based sector ’.
(33) For the purposes of this Regulation, the term ‘energy efficiency’ is used in a broad sense and should be constr ued by
taking into account relevant Union law, including Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 of the European Parliament and of the
Council (48) and Directives 2012/27/EU (49) and (EU) 2018/844 (50) of the European Parliament and of the Council,
as well as the implementing measures adopt ed pursuant to Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and
of the Council (51).
(34) For each environmental objective, uniform criteria for determining whether economic activities contr ibute substantially
to that objective should be laid down. One element of the unif orm criteria should be to avoid signif icant harm to any of
the environmental objectives set out in this Regulation. This is in order to avoid that investments qualify as
envi ronmentally sustainable in cases where the economic activities benefitt ing from those investments cause harm to
the environment to an extent that outweighs their contr ibution to an envi ronmental objective. Such criteria should
take into account the life cycle of the products and services provided by that economic activity in addition to the
envi ronmental impact of the economic activity itself, including taking into account evidence from existing life-cy cle
assessments, in particular by consider ing their production, use and end of life.
