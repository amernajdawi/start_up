functionally more useful. On-farm product processing is product
processing done on the farm with produce from the farm.
Rolling base period Base periods that move forward in time with each reporting period.
Ruminants Mammals that digest plant-based f ood by softening it within a first
stomach (the ‘rumen’), then regurgitating the semi-digested mass (the
‘cud’) for further chewing. Enteric fermentation  results from the 
microbial fermentation of food in the rumen. Examples of ruminants
include cattle, goats, sheep, bison,  yaks, water buffalo, and deer. 
Scope Defines the operational boundaries  in relation to direct  and indirect  
GHG emissions.
   Scope 1 Direct  GHG emissions from sources owned or controlled by the 
reporting company.
   Scope 2 Emissions associated with the generation of electricity, heating/ 
cooling, or steam purchased for the reporting company’s own
consumption.
   Scope 3 Indirect  emissions other than those covered in scope 2 . 
Timberbelt Multiple row field windbreaks that are planted with commercially
valuable, fast-growing trees (such as hybrid poplar or hybrid willow) to provide conservation benefits, improve adjacent crop yields, diversify on-farm income sources, and produce commercially valuable
wood products.  
Volatilization of soil
nitrogen The vaporization of soil NH 3 and NO X and their subsequent release
into the atmosphere.
