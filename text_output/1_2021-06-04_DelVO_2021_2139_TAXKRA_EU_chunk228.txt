(d) definition of the area according to its gazetting in the land registry;
(e) compartments, roads, rights of way and other public access, physical
features including waterways, areas under legal and other restrictions;
(f) measures deployed to maintain the good condition of forest
ecosystems;
(g) consideration of societal issues (including preservation of landscape,
consultation of stakeholders in accordance with the terms and
conditions laid down in national law);
(h) assessment of forest related risks, including forest fires, and pests and
diseases outbreaks, with the aim of preventing, reducing and
controlling the risks and measures deployed to ensure protection
and adaptation against residual risks;
(i) all DNSH relevant to forest management.
1.3. The forest management plan or the equivalent instrument:
(a) shows a primary designated management objective (  57 ) that consists in 
protection of soil and water (  58 ), conservation of biodiversity (  59 ) or 
social services (  60 ) based on the FAO definitions; 
(b) promotes biodiversity-friendly practices that enhance forestsâ€™ natural
processes;
(c) includes an analysis of:
(i) impacts and pressures on habitat conservation and diversity of
associated habitats;
(ii) condition of harvesting minimizing soil impacts;
(iii) other activities that have an impact on conservation objectives,
such as hunting and fishing, agricultural, pastoral and forestry
activities, industrial, mining, and commercial activities.
1.4. The sustainability of the forest management system as documented
in the plan referred to in point 1.1 is ensured by choosing the most
ambitious of the following approaches:
(a) the forest management matches the national definition of sustainable
forest management, if any;
(b) the forest management matches the Forest Europe definition (  61 ) of 
sustainable forest management and complies with the Pan-European
Operational Level Guidelines for Sustainable Forest Management (  62 )
