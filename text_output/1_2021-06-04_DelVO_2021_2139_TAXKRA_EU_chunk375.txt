(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  The vessels are not dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Measures are in place to manage waste, both in the use phase and the end- 
of-life of the vessel, in accordance with the waste hierarchy, including the
control and management of hazardous materials on board of ships and
ensuring their safe recycling.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Vessels comply with the emission limits of Annex II to Regulation (EU) 
2016/1628 (including vessels meeting those limits without type-approved
solutions such as through after-treatment).  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  N/A  
6.10.  Sea and coastal freight water transport, vessels for port operations and auxiliary activities  
Description of the activity  
Purchase, financing, chartering (with or without crew) and operation of vessels designed and equipped for transport
of freight or for the combined transport of freight and passengers on sea or coastal waters, whether scheduled or
not. Purchase, financing, renting and operation of vessels required for port operations and auxiliary activities, such
as tugboats, mooring vessels, pilot vessels, salvage vessels and ice-breakers.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular H50.2, H52.22
and N77.34 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.EN  9.12.2021 Official Journal of the European Union L 442/293
