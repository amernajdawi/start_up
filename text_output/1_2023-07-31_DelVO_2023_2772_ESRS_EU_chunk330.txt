ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 143/284(c) At least 25% of agricultural land is under organic farming management, and the uptake of agro-ecological
practices is significantly increased.
(d) Three billion additional trees are planted in the EU, in full respect of ecological principles.
(e) Significant progress in the remediation of contaminated soil sites
.
(f) At least 25 000 km of free-flowing rivers are restored.
(g) The losses of nutrients from fertilisers are reduced by 50%, resulting in the reduction of the use of fertilisers by
at least 20%.
(h) The negative impacts on sensitive species and habitats, including on the seabed through fishing and extraction
activities, are substantially reduced to achieve good environmental status.
AR 3. If disclosing a transition plan, the undertaking may also refer to the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular:
(a) SDG 2 - End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture;
(b) SDG 6 - Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all;
(c) SDG 14 - Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development;
and
(d) SDG 15 - Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests,
combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.
Impact, risk and opportunity management
Disclosure requirements related to ESRS 2 IRO-1 – Description of the processes to identify and assess material
biodiversity and ecosystem-related impacts, risks and opportunities
AR 4. The materiality assessment under ESRS E4 includes the undertaking’s:
(a) contribution to direct impact drivers on biodiversity loss (81):
i. climate change;
ii. land-use change (e.g., land artificialisation), freshwater -use change and sea-use change;
iii. direct exploitation;
iv. invasive alien species;
v. pollution; and
vi. others.
(b) impacts on the state of species (i.e., species population size, species global extinction risk);
(c) impacts on the extent and condition of ecosystems including through land degradation, desertification and
soil sealing); and
(d) impacts and dependencies on ecosystem services.
AR 5. When assessing the materiality of impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities the undertaking shall consider
the provisions in ESRS 2 IRO-1 and ESRS 1 Chapter 3 Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures and
describe its considerations.
