(b) favour nature-based solutions (  317  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  318  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  N/A  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Fans, compressors, pumps and other equipment used which is covered by 
Directive 2009/125/EC comply, where relevant, with the top class
requirements of the energy label, and otherwise comply with imple ­
menting regulations under that Directive and represent the best available
technology.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
4.16.  Installation and operation of electric heat pumps  
Description of the activity  
Installation and operation of electric heat pumps.  
Where an economic activity is an integral element of the ‘Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy
technologies’ as referred to in Section 7.6 of this Annex, the technical screening criteria specified in Section 7.6
apply.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular D35.30, F43.22
in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.

( 317  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta neously 
provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse,
nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient an d
systemic interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosyste m
services (version of 4.6.2021: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/nature-based-solutio ns_
en/).
