ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 188/284AR 52. When modifying or replacing a target in the reporting period, the undertaking may explain the change by cross-
referencing it to significant changes in the business model or to broader changes in the accepted standard or
legislation from which the target is derived to provide contextual information as per ESRS 2 BP-2 Disclosures in
relation to specific circumstances.
Disclosure Requirement S1-6 – Characteristics of the Undertaking’s Employees
AR 53. This Disclosure Requirement covers all employees who perform work for any of the undertaking’s entities
included in its sustainability reporting.
AR 54. Providing a breakdown of employees by country gives insight into the distribution of activity across countries.
The number of employees in each country is also a key trigger for many information, consultation and
participation rights for workers and workers' representatives, both in the Union labour law acquis (for example,
Directive 2009/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (101)“European Works Councils Directive”
and Directive 2002/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (102)“Information and Consultation
Directive”) and in national law (for example, rights to establish a works council or to have board level employee
representation). Providing a breakdown of employees by gender and type of employment relationship gives
insight into gender representation across the undertaking. Additionally, providing a breakdown of employees by
region gives insight into regional variations. A region can refer to a country or other geographic locations, such
as a region within a country or a world region.
AR 55. The undertaking shall disclose the requested disclosures in the following tabular formats:
Table 1

In some Member States it is possible for persons to legally register themselves as having a third, often neutral, gender, which
is categorised as “other” in the table above. However, if the undertaking is disclosing data about employees where this is not
possible, it may explain this and indicate that the “other” category is not applicable.
Table 2

representing at least 10% of its total number of employees.
