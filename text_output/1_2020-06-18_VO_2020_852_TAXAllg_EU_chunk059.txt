(d) switch ing to the use of sustainably sourced renewable mater ials;
(e) increasing the use of environmentally safe carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) and carbon capture and storag e (CCS)
technologies that deliver a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions;
(f) strengthening land carbon sink s, including through avoiding deforestation and forest degradation, restoration of
forests, sustainable management and restoration of croplands, grasslands and wetlands, afforestation, and rege nerative
agriculture;
(g) establishing energy infrastr ucture required for enabling the decarbonisation of energy systems;
(h) producing clean and efficient fuels from renewable or carbon-neutral sources; or
(i) enabling any of the activities listed in points (a) to (h) of this paragraph in accordance with Article 16.
2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, an economic activity for which there is no technologically and economically feasible
low-carbon altern ative shall qualify as contr ibuting substantially to climat e change mitigation where it suppor ts the
transition to a climat e-neutral econom y consistent with a pathwa y to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 0C abov e pre-
industr ial levels, including by phasing out greenhouse gas emissions, in particular emissions from solid fossil fuels, and

(a) has greenhouse gas emission levels that correspond to the best performa nce in the sector or industr y;
(b) does not hamper the development and deplo yment of low-carbon alternatives; and
(c) does not lead to a lock-in of carbon-inten sive assets, consider ing the economic lifetime of those assets.
For the purpose of this paragraph and the establishment of technical screening criteria pursuant to Article 19, the
Commission shall assess the poten tial contr ibution and feasibility of all relevant existing technologies.
3. The Commission shall adop t a delegat ed act in accordance with Article 23 to:
(a) supplement paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article by establishing technical screening criteria for deter mining the
conditions under whic h a specifi c economic activity qualifi es as contr ibuting substantially to climate change
mitigation; and
(b) supplement Article 17 by establishing, for each relevant environmental objective, technical screening criteria for
deter mining whether an economic activity in respect of which technical screening criteria have been established
pursuant to point (a) of this paragraph causes signif icant harm to one or more of those objectives.
4. Prior to adopt ing the delegat ed act refer red to in paragraph 3 of this Article, the Commission shall consult the
