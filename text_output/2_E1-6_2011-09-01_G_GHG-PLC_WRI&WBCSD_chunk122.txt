10.1 Introduction
The term uncertainty assessment refers to a systematic procedure to quantify or qualify
the uncertainty in a product inventory. Understanding uncertainty can be crucial
for properly interpreting inventory results. Identifying and documenting sources of
uncertainty can assist companies in understanding the steps needed to improve inventory
quality and increase the level of confidence users have in the inventory results. Because the
audience for a product inventory report is diverse, companies should make a thorough yet
practical effort to communicate the level of confidence and key sources of uncertainty in the
inventory results.
This chapter provides requirements and guidance to
help companies identify, assess, and report qualitative
information on inventory uncertainty. Detailed
descriptions of quantitative approaches to assess
uncertainty, and an uncertainty calculation tool are
available at ( www.ghgprotocol.org ). While remaining
current with leading science and practice, the chapter
is intended to favor practicality and feasibility for
companies with a range of uncertainty expertise. 10.2 Requirements
Companies shall report a qualitative
statement on sources of inventory
uncertainty and methodological choices.
Methodological choices include:
•Use and end-of-life profile
• Allocation methods, including allocation
due to recycling
• Source of global warming potential
(GWP) values used
 •Calculation models  

See table 10.2 for guidance on reporting on these choices.
