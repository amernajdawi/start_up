(a) harvest parts and components that are suited for re-use;
(b) separate non-hazardous and hazardous waste fractions suited for material recovery including recovery of critical raw
materials;
(c) remove hazardous substances, mixtures and components, so that these are contained in an identifiable (61)stream or
that are an identifiable part of a stream within the treatment process, and send them to facilities permitted for proper
treatment including disposal of hazardous waste;
(d) enclose documentation of the materials that are sent for further treatment or reuse.
