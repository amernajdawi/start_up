ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 42/1642.3. Collection and transport of non-hazardous and hazardous waste
Description of the activity
Separate collection and transport of non-hazardous and hazardous (45)waste aimed at preparing for re-use (46)or
recycling (47), including the construction, operation and upgrade of facilities involved in the collection and transport of
such waste, such as civic amenity centres and waste transfer stations, as a means for material recovery.
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E38.11, E38.12 and
F42.9 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.
Technical screening criteria
Substantial contribution to the transition to a circular economy
1.All separately collected and transported waste that is segregated at source is intended for preparation for reuse or
recycling operations.
2.Source segregated waste consisting of (i) paper and cardboard; (ii) textiles (48); (iii) biowaste; (iv) wood; (v) glass; (vi) waste
from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE); or (vii) any type of hazardous waste is collected separately (i.e. in single
fractions) and not commingled with other waste streams.
For source segregated non-hazardous waste other than the fractions mentioned above, collection in commingled fractions
takes place only where it meets one of the conditions laid down in Article 10, paragraph 3, indents (a), (b) or (c) of
Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (49).
Different types of hazardous waste may be placed together in a hazardous waste box, cabinet or similar solution under the condition that each waste type is properly packaged to keep the waste separate in the box or cabinet and that hazardous
waste is sorted in waste types after collection from households.
3.For municipal waste streams, the activity complies with one of the following criteria:
(a) the activity carries out municipal solid waste collection mainly via door-to-door collection schemes or supervised
collection points to ensure a high level of separate collection and low rates of contamination;
(b) the activity carries out separate waste collection within publicly organised waste management systems where waste
producers are charged based on a pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) mechanism, at least for the residual waste stream or there
are other types of economic instruments in place that incentivise waste segregation at source (
50);
(45)‘Hazardous waste’ is waste which displays one or more of the hazardous properties listed in Annex III of Directive 2008/98/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives (OJ L 312, 22.11.2008,
p. 3). It includes streams such as hazardous waste fractions produced by households, waste oils, batteries, non-depolluted waste from
electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), non-depolluted end-of-life vehicle, medical waste, etc. A comprehensive classification of hazardous waste can be found in the European List of Waste (Decision 2000/532/EC).
(46)‘Preparing for re-use’ means checking, cleaning or repairing recovery operations, by which products or components of products that
have become waste are prepared so that they can be re-used without any other pre-processing.
(47)‘Recycling’ means any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances whether for
the original or other purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material but does not include energy recovery and the
reprocessing into materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations.
(48)This includes textiles, clothes/wearing apparel, footwear and accessories, such as belts or hats.
