GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 4 A note on terminology in GH G Protocol publications The GHG Protocol uses specific terms to connote reporting requirements and recommendations. The term “shall” is used in this Guidance to indicate what is required for a GHG inventory to conform to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. The term “should” is used to indicate a reco mmendation, but not a requirement. The term “may” is used to i ndicate an option that is permissible or allowable. This publication contains requi rements and guidance from the Corporate Standard, and additional, sect or-specific recommendations. Part 1: GENERAL INFORMATION

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 5 Chapter 1: Introduction Agriculture is a major contribu tor to global emissions of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) that drive climate change. Leadership and innova tion from the sector is therefore vital in making progress in reducing these emissions a nd in abating the worst effects of climate change on agricultural production. Action in th is arena also makes good business sense. By addressing GHG emissions , companies (and producers1) can identify opportunities to bolster their bottom line, reduce risk, and discover competitive advantages. A GHG emissions inventory is the foundational tool that al lows a company to understand its GHG emissions and build effective climat e change strategies. GHG inventories help companies understand their exposure to GHG-re lated risks, identify emissions reduction opportunities, create baseline data and reduc tion targets for tracking performance, and communicate performance to key audiences, in cluding internal management and external stakeholders. Realizing these benefits require s that inventories are prepared according to industry-accepted best practices. This chapter:  Introduces the family of GHG Protocol publi cations that define best practices for developing GHG emissi ons inventories.  Describes how and why the Agricultural Guidance (‘Guidance’) was developed, and for whom.  Describes what guidance is (and is no t) provided in this publication.  Summarizes how the Guidance differs from the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, a nd relates to other GHG Protocol publications. 1.1 Agriculture and climate change The international community has adopted a goal to restrict global warming to 2oC above pre-industrial levels2. Temperature rise above 2oC will produce increasingly unpredictable and dangerous impacts for peopl e and ecosystems, but particularly for agricultural systems. Impacts on the agricultu ral sector that are already occurring but expected to intensify include increased irriga tion water needs, increased spread of animal and crop diseases and pests, reduced forage quality, and reduced cr op and pasture yields (Easterling et al., 2007). These impacts stem from changes in surface temperatures, the timing of seasons, and in the frequency and se verity of severe weather events, such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves. Achieving the 2 oC goal will require drastic reducti ons in GHG emissions. Here, again, the agricultural sector is central. A wide range of ag ricultural activ ities emit GHGs 1 In this Guidance, the terms ‘producer’ and ‘company ’ are used synonymously to refer to any entity that develops an inventory of the agricultural GHG emissions. The terms ‘farm’, ‘farmland’ and ‘agricultural land’ are also used interchangeably to refer to the land on which agriculture is practiced. 2 See paragraph 1 of ‘Report of the Conference of the Parties on its fifteenth session, held in Copenhagen from 7 to 19 December 2009’ (http://unfccc.int/documentation/documents/adva nced_search/items/6911.php?priref=600005735 )

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 6 (Figure 1-1), and together they directly contributed about 11%3 of total global anthropogenic emissions in 2010, and roughly 60% of all nitrous oxide (N 2O) emissions and 50% of all methane (CH 4) emissions in 2007 (Smith et al., 2007a). Land use change (LUC), caused by the conversion of native habita ts to farmland, contributes a comparable amount of emissions (Houghton, 2012). Finally, the production of agricultural inputs and various downstream activities, such as the processing and transport of agricultural products, contributes a further 3 - 6 % of global emissions (Vermuelen et al., 2012).

The GHG Protocol is a multi-stakeholder pa rtnership of businesses, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), governments and ot hers convened by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Counc il for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Launched in 1998, the mission of the GHG Protocol is to develop and promote the use of industry-accepted best practices for GHG accounting. To date, the GHG Protocol has released four standards that define best practices for how GHG emissions inventories should be performed at the enterprise, proj ect, and product levels (Table 1-1). All publications are available from the GHG Protocol website ( www.ghgprotocol.org ). 3 Value calculated using data from Tubiello et al., (2014) and WRI (2014)

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 7 This Guidance defines agriculture as the cultivation of animals, plants, and fungi for food, fiber, biofuels, drugs or other purposes .* Definition developed by the stakeholders involved in this Guidance’s development process. Table 1-1. The GHG Protocol family of publications Type of GHG assessment GHG Protocol publication Enterprise ‐level Development of GHG emissions inventories that itemize the emissions from all of the operations that together comprise the reporting company Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (‘Corporate Standard’) The Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (‘Scope 3 Standard’) provides additional requirements and guidance on developing comprehensive inventories of scope 3 emissions (see Box 1‐1 for an introduction to the concept of ‘scopes’) Project‐level The quantification of the GHG impacts of projects that have been undertaken to reduce emissions, avoid emissions occurring in the future, or sequester carbon Project Protocol Product‐level The development of GHG emissions inventories of the entire life cycle impacts of individual products or services, from raw material extraction to product disposal Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard (‘Product Standard’) 1.3 Why an Agricultural Guidance? The Corporate Standard pr ovides a high-level, cross- sector accounting framework. But, it does not address many accounting and reporting issues specific to agriculture. These include:  The profound influence of environmental factors on agricultural GHG fluxes (emissions or removals) 4, which complicates efforts to separate anthropogenic from non-anthropogenic effect s and thus ensure that GHG inventories are useful as management tools.  Obtaining accurate, site-specific flux data when environmental conditions vary a lot across landscapes.  Setting and tracking progress toward emi ssion reduction goals against a background of highly variable GHG fluxes. 4 GHG fluxes are the emissions to or re movals from the atmosphere of GHGs. 

--- Page 8 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 8  Carbon (C) sequestration and accounting for changes in the management and ownership of different carbon pools .  The fact that agricultural activities do not immediatel y result in GHG fluxes (e.g., delayed emissions from decomposition of post-harvest detritus).  The types of organizational structures and operational practices specific to agriculture. This Guidance outlines recommended methodolog ies to address these and other issues important to the sector, while incorporating requirements in the Corporate Standard. Because the agricultural sector is highly di verse, this Guidance aims to establish a common framework that is applicable to the myriad subsectors within agriculture. This Guidance can largely be used on its own fo r developing GHG invent ories. However, it does not address certain topics covered by the Corporate Standard, such as the verification of GHG inventor ies or setting of GHG reduc tion targets (see Chapter 1.5). The specific objectives of this Guidance are to:  Increase consistency and transparency in GHG accounting and reporting within the agricultural sector.  Help companies cost-effectively prepare GHG inventories that are true and fair accounts of their climate impact.  Enable GHG inventories to meet the d ecision-making needs of both internal management and external stakeholders (e.g., investors) and so provide for the more effective management of agricultural GHG fluxes. What does this Guidance not do? This Guidance is squarely focused on corpor ate- or farm-level accounting and reporting issues and:  Does not advance methods for projec t- or product-level GHG accounting (e.g., product category rules).  Does not provide accounting methods for indirect Land Use Change (iLUC). iLUC occurs when an existing crop is diverted for another purpose, such as transportation fuel production, and replacement crops are then grown on formerly non-agricultural lands. An example of iLUC is when sugar cane is diverted from sugar to biofuel production, causing forests to be cleare d for additional sugarcane production. Accounting for such iLUC impacts requires a project-based approach to determine what the GHG fluxes would have been in th e absence of the mark et intervention. The Project Protocol provides general, high-le vel guidance that can help inform how to account for iLUC impacts.  Does not require sector-specific GHG perfor mance metrics. The choice of a metric has to be guided by a company’s objectives in developing an inventory and by the specific operations and sources that char acterize that company. (Appendix I provides an overview of the advantages and disadvant ages of different types of metrics.)  Does not require specific methods or t ools for calculating agricultural GHG fluxes.  Does not provide guidance on the selection and deployment of GHG mitigation practices on farms. 

--- Page 9 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 9  Does not address environmental impacts ot her than GHG fluxes, such as water use, eutrophication, and emissions of air pollu tants. Consequently, this Guidance cannot be used by itself to evaluate the po ssible trade-offs between GHG emissions reductions and other environmental imp acts of a given farming practice. 1.4 Who should use this Guidance? This Guidance is primarily intended for produc ers and companies that seek to develop scope 1 and 2 inventories of their agricultur al operations (Box 1-1). Examples include fruit and crop growers, ranchers, and biof uel producers. While producers with small agricultural operations may find it difficult to devote the resources to use this Guidance, it is applicable to operations of all sizes. Box 1-1. The concept of scopes Under the Corporate Standard emi ssions sources are categorized as direct or indirect and then further divided into ‘scopes’:  Direct sources: Owned or controlled by the reporting company. All direct sources are classified as scope 1 .  Indirect sources: Owned or controlled by another company, but a portion of whose emissions are a consequence of the activi ties of the reporting company. Indirect sources are either scope 2 or scope 3 : scope 2 emissions stem from the generation of electricity, heat, or steam that is purch ased by the reporting company, while scope 3 emissions are all other indirect emissions. The focus of this Guidance is on including sc ope 1 and scope 2 sources in inventories, although certain scope 3 sources ar e also discussed because they are highly emitting.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 10 Other users This Guidance will be helpful to downstream or upstream companies that seek to understand their value chain GHG impacts fr om agriculture. Down stream companies include processors (e.g., slaughterhouses and biofuel makers), brand manufacturers that make packaged food products, and retailers th at make private label food products, while upstream companies include manufacturers of fa rm inputs, such as seeds, fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. Agricultural emissions will often form a substantial part of the scope 3 inventories of these companies and will fall into the Scope 3 Standard’s Category 1 (Purchased Goods and Services) and Category 11 (Use of Sold Products) for downstream and upstream companies, respec tively. Companies completing a value chain assessment should consult the Scope 3 Standa rd for additional requirements and guidance on including agriculture in their inventories. GHG reporting programs and policy makers may also be interested in incorporating this Guidance into their policy or program design. Many companies in other sectors also have land-based GHG fluxes. Examples include the construction, mining, and utility sectors. While this Guidance is likely broadly applicable to these sectors, it has not been evaluated for use outside of the agricultural sector. 1.5 Relationship between this Guidance and the Corporate Standard The Corporate Standard outlines requirements and/or guidance on a range of topics, ranging from inventory desi gn to tracking emissions over time. This Guidance summarizes and customizes most of this c ontent to the agricultural sector, adding additional recommendations in many areas. However, this Guidance does not include guidance on inventory verificati on and target setting, and on othe r topics that are included in the Corporate Standard, but not relevant to the sector. For such guidance, users should consult the Corporate Standard. Table 1-2 maps the content of this Guidance onto that of the Corporate Standard, while Table 1-3 summarizes the main recommendations made in this Guidance. Note that, under the Corporate Standard, companies must report emissions of at least the seven Kyoto GHGs , which are: carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N2O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocar bons (HFCs), sulphur hexaflouride (SF 6), and nitrogen triflouride (NF 3). This same principle applies to companies using this Guidance. However, agricultural activities ty pically generate only a subset of these GHGs (see Chapter 4).

Summary of main recommendations in this Guidance for applying requirements in the Corporate Standard. Chapter in the Corporate Standard Requirements in the Corporate Standard Additional, sector-specific recommendations in the Agricultural Guidance Chapter 1. GHG Accounting and Reporting Principles  Base GHG accounting and reporting on the following principles: relevance, completeness, consistency, transparency, and accuracy. Chapter 3. Setting Organizational Boundaries  Select a single consolidation approach to establish the organizational boundaries. Chapter 4. Setting Operational Boundaries  Separately account for and report on scope 1 and 2, at a minimum.  Accounting should take appropriate note of production contracts and other forms of agricultural contracting, land and equipment leases, and membership of co-operatives. Chapter 6. Tracking Emissions Over Time  Choose and establish a base period, and specify the reasons for choosing that period.  The base period shall be the earliest point in time for which verifiable data are available on scope 1 and scope 2 emissions.  Develop a base period emissions recalculation policy, and clearly articulate the basis and context for any recalculations. If applicable, the policy shall state any “significant threshold”.  Recalculate the base period  Multi-year base periods are recommended for many companies.

Chapter 9. Reporting GHG Emissions Companies shall report:  An outline of the operational boundaries chosen and, if scope 3 is included, a list specifying which types of activities are covered.  An outline of the organizational boundaries chosen, including the chosen consolidation approach. Companies should report:  The reporting period covered.  Data for all seven GHGs (CO 2, CH 4, N2O, SF 6, PFCs, HFCs and NF 3), disaggregated by GHG and reported in units of both metric tonnes and tonnes CO 2-equivalent (CO 2e).  Total scope 1 and 2 emissions.  Data disaggregated by scope.  Scope 1 data disaggregated by mechanical versus non- mechanical sources.  Data reported in the scopes without subtractions for trades in offsets.  Methodologies used to calculate or measure emissions, providing a reference or link to any calculation tools used.  Whether the calculation methodologies used for ‘non- mechanical’ sources are IPCC Tier 1, 2, or 3.  Methodology used (where relevant) to amortize the CO 2 fluxes to/from C stocks.  Assumptions regarding any use of proxy data in calculating the impacts of historical changes in management on C stocks.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 14  Year chosen as base year, and an emissions profile over time that is consistent with and clarifies the chosen policy for making base year emissions recalculations.  Appropriate context for any significant emissions changes that trigger base year emissions recalculation.  Any specific exclusions of sources, facilities, and / or operations.  Any exclusions of the impacts of historical management practices on C stocks.  CO 2 emissions from biologically sequestered carbon, separately from the scopes.  Biologically sequestered carbon reported outside of the scopes (but is optional to report).  Net CO 2 flux data for the C stocks in above-ground and below-ground biomass, DOM and soils (in tonnes CO 2).  Where LUC results in a reduction in the size of C stocks, report the CO 2 emissions in Scope 1.  Otherwise, report all CO 2 fluxes outside of the scopes in a separate category (‘Biogenic Carbon’) divided into three components: (1) CO 2 fluxes (emissions or removals) during land use management; (2) Sequestration during LUC; and (3) CO 2 emissions from biofuel combustion.  Account for historical changes in land use or management occurring on or after the base period.  Use a ‘fixed-rate’ approach to amortize change in C stocks over time.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 15 1.6 How does this Guidance relate to the GHG Protocol Product Standard? Product GHG inventories and corporate inve ntories (when scope 3 emissions are included) are complementary and they togeth er provide a comprehe nsive approach to value chain GHG management. For example, product and corporate inventories are mutually supportive when:  Corporate inventories are used to identify products that ar e likely to have the most significant GHG footprints based on their us e of highly emitting sources, such as specific raw materials (e.g., fertilizers).  Product inventories are used to inform GH G reduction strategies that impact both product and corporate inventories.  Product inventories are used to extrapol ate to relevant upstream and downstream scope 3 emissions in a corporate inventory. Companies may wish to complete scope 3 and product GHG invent ories in parallel. Alternatively, they may develop scope 1 and 2 inventories to supply information requested by a buyer for the purpos e of its scope 3 and product i nventories. In either case, companies should be mindful of certain di fferences between this Guidance and the Product Standard that can affect the extent to which both types of inventories are mutually supportive (Table 1-4). Table 1-4. Differences in methodologies between this Guidance and the Product Standard that affect how useful a corpor ate inventory is for product GHG inventories (and vice-versa). GHG reporting issue Recommendation in the Agricultural Guidance Requirement in the Product Standard Scope 3 sources Should be reported Emissions from all relevant upstream and downstream sources shall be reflected in the inventory of a given product (though downstream emissions need not be considered in cradle-to-farm gate analyses) CO 2 fluxes to/from carbon stocks in soils  Should be reported The following fluxes shall be accounted for:  CO 2 emissions and removals due to C stock change occurring as a result of land conversion within or between land use categories (e.g., adoption of no-till practices or land use change)  Emissions from the preparation of converted land (e.g., biomass burning or liming)  The CO 2 fluxes to/from soils that occur as a result of subsequent land use (e.g., fertilizer application and harvesting) are optional and may be included, provided CO 2 fluxes to/from C stocks in biomass and dead organic matter (DOM)  CO 2 emissions should be reported  CO 2 removals by woody vegetation should be reported  CO 2 removals by herbaceous vegetation, should not be reported

The revenue from offset credits is often mentioned as a leading reason for why agricultural companies should become interested in managing their GHG fluxes. Soil C sequestration, in particular, is considered an important potential source of offset credits because it offers most (~89%) of the global potential for reducing the emissions from agriculture (Smith et al., 2007b). The Corporat e Standard, and therefore this Guidance, do not address the accounting steps needed to cr eate offset credits from soils, biomass or other sources located on farms. For exampl e, this Guidance does not consider the permanence of C sequestration. Instead, fluxes to/from C stocks are simply reported as they occur (or projected to occur5) and there is no considera tion of policy measures to ensure the permanence of sequestered C (e.g., insurance mechanisms, project buffers, etc.). For such guidance reader s should instead refer to the Project Protocol and its companion document, the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry Guidance for GHG Project Accounting . 1.8 How was this Guidance developed? This Guidance is the culmination of an intern ational, three-year st akeholder consultation process that involved over 150 Techni cal Working Group (TWG) members from businesses, government agencies, NGOs, and acad emic institutions. Milestones include:  January, 2011: Publicatio n of WRI Working Paper  March, 2011: Formation of TWG  January, 2012: First draft of Guidance  April, 2012: Stakeholder workshop in Washington, DC  August, 2012: Second draft of Guidance  September, 2012: TWG workshop in Sao Paulo  January, 2013: TWG workshop in Sao Paulo  March – August, 2013: Road testin g and public open comment period  October, 2013: Third draft of Guidance 5 Chapter 8 describes how projected changes in C stocks can be calculated and reflected in inventories.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 17 Chapter 2: Business goals The development of a GHG inventory can be a significant undertaking. Companies should therefore have clearly defined goals for managing their GHG fluxes and understand how inventories will allow them to meet those goals. Companies generally want their GHG inventories to be capable of serving multiple goals. It therefore makes sense to design the inventory process from th e outset to provide information for a variety of different users and uses – both current and future. This chapter:  Reviews the various goals that GHG emi ssions inventories can help companies meet.  Describes the potential economic and envi ronmental benefits from a range of GHG reduction measures. 2.1 Overview of business goals Agricultural companies can have diverse reasons for developing inventories. These reasons generally involve (Table 2-1):  Identifying opportunities to reduce GHG emissi ons (or sequester C), setting baselines and reduction targets, and tracking performance.  Identifying opportunities to reduce costs a nd increase productivity (e.g., conservation tillage and cover cropp ing can help to reduce fertilizer and fuel costs; Table 2-2).  Managing reputational risks and opportuni ties associated wi th agricultural GHG fluxes (e.g., meeting the requirements of buye rs such as processors and food and drink companies, and repo rting to civil society).  A desire to sustain farmlands for future generations. GHG emissions reduction measures may also offer co-benefits such as:  Reduced erosion and land degradation  Reduced phosphorous (P) and nitrogen (N) runoff  Improved water quality and retention  Control of air pollutants (e.g, ammonia and hydrogen sulphide)  Increased soil fertility Often, these co-benefits can help to redu ce costs and increase productivity on farms. Table 2-2 summarizes common agricultural practices that provide GHG and other benefits. Stockwell & Bitan (2011) provide further information on these practices. Because agro-ecosystems are inherently complex, reduction measures should not be selected in isolation of each other, but rather selected us ing a whole-farm or systems approach. This ensures that interactions be tween the C and nitrogen (N) cycles on farms, as well as trade-offs between the emissions of different GHGs, are taken into account and that reduction measures can be more effec tively integrated into individual farming

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 22 Chapter 3: Principles As with financial accounting and repo rting principles, generally accepted GHG accounting principles are intended to ensure that an inventor y represents a faithful, true, and fair account of a company’s GHG fluxes. This chapter:  Introduces GHG accounting and reporting principles as they apply to farms, businesses and others in the agriculture sector. 3.1 Overview of principles GHG accounting and reporting shall be base d on the following principles: Relevance: The GHG inventory shall appropriate ly reflect the GHG fluxes of the company and serve the decision-making needs of users – both internal and external to the company. Completeness: Companies shall account for and re port on all GHG emission sources and activities within the inventory boundary, to the extent pr acticable and relevant to the purpose of the inventory. Any specific exclus ions shall be disclosed and justified. Consistency: Companies shall use consistent me thodologies to allow for meaningful performance tracking and comparison of GHG flux data over time, business units, geographies or suppliers. Transparency: Companies shall address all relevant issues in a factual and coherent manner, based on a clear audit trail. Comp anies shall also disclose any relevant assumptions and make appropriate refe rences to the accounting and calculation methodologies and data sources used. Accuracy: Companies shall ensure that estimates of GHG fluxes are as accurate as possible and that they are not sy stematically over or under actu al fluxes, as far as can be judged. A level of accuracy is needed that will allow users to make decisions with reasonable confidence as to the inte grity of the reported information. The accuracy of GHG flux data is a part icular concern for many agricultural GHG sources, including C stocks, soils, and enteri c fermentation (see Chapter 7). Reporting on measures taken to ensure accuracy and improve accuracy over time can help promote the credibility and enhance the tr ansparency of inventories. In practice, companies may encounter trade-o ffs between principles when completing an inventory. In particular, a co mpany may find that achieving th e most complete inventory requires the use of less accurate data, compromising overall accuracy. Conversely,

Companies should balance tradeoffs between principles depending on their individual business goals. For instance, relatively less accurate data may be appropriate for the initial evaluation of GHG reduction opportunitie s, whereas more accurate data may be required to track progress toward a specific GHG reduction target.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 24 Chapter 4: Overview of agricultural emission sources Many different types of emission sources are as sociated with agriculture, such as fuel use, soils, and manure management. Unde rstanding the qualitative differences amongst these is crucial to many step s in inventory development, including calculating, reporting, and undertaking the quality cont rol of GHG flux data. This chapter:  Distinguishes between two types of emissions sources – mechanical and non- mechanical sources – whose fluxes differ in fundamental ways, with important implications for GHG inventory development.  Describes the variety and relative importance of thes e sources along agricultural value chains. 4.1 Overview of agricultural sources Figure 4-1 lists the princi pal emission sources found on farmland. An important distinction for the agricultura l sector is between mechani cal and non-mechanical sources. This is because agriculture re lies on biological systems, whose emissions or removals of GHGs generally occur through much more complex mechanisms than the emissions from the mechanical equipment used on farmland. Non-mechanical sources are either biologi cal processes shaped by climatic and soil conditions (e.g., decomposition) or the bur ning of crop residues. They are often connected by complex patterns of N and C fl ows through farms. Non-mechanical sources emit CO 2, CH 4 and N 2O (or precursors of these GHGs) through different routes. CO 2 fluxes are mostly controlled by uptake thr ough plant photosynthesis and releases via respiration, decomposition and the combus tion of organic matter. In turn, N 2O emissions result from nitrification and denitrification (see Box 4-1), and CH 4 emissions result from methanogenesis under anaerobic conditions in soils and manure storage, enteric fermentation, and the incomplete combustion of organic matter. Mechanical sources are equipment or mach inery operated on farms, such as mobile machinery (e.g., harvesters), stationary equi pment (e.g., boilers), and refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment. These sources emit CO 2, CH 4, and N 2O, or HFCs and PFCs, and their emissions are wholly determined by the properties of the source equipment and material inputs (e.g., fuel composition).

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 25 Figure 4-1. Agricultural emissions sources Relative importance of diffe rent agricultural sources Globally, non-mechanical sources are larger than mechanical sources (Figure 4-2; U.S. EPA, 2006a), with enteric fermentation (CH 4) and soils (N 2O) being the largest sources (U.S. EPA, 2006b). The exact contribu tion of agriculture to global CO 2 emissions is hard to quantify. This is because the biomass and soil C pools not only emit large amounts of CO 2, but also take up CO 2. Nevertheless, additional C sequestration offers most (~89%) of the global emissions mitigation potential in agriculture (Smith et al., 2007b). Agriculture-driven LUC is also a globally important source of CO 2 emissions. At the farm scale, the relative magnitude of different emission sources and of different GHGs will vary widely depending on the t ype of farm, management practices, and natural factors at play. These factors incl ude original land cove r; farm topography and hydrology; soil microbial density and ecology; soil temperature, moisture, organic content and composition; crop or livestock type; and land and waste management practices. Few studies have looked at the relati ve contribution of diffe rent sources to the whole-farm inventories of diffe rent farming systems using a consistent set of methods. It is difficult to accurately predict the relative magnitude of different sources for a given farm. Nonetheless, certain broad patterns can be expected (e.g., Figure 4-3). Mechanical Purchased electricity: CO 2, CH 4, and N 2O Mobile machinery (e.g., tilling, sowing, harvesting, and transport and fishing vessels): CO 2, CH 4, and N 2O Stationary machinery (e.g., milling and irrigation equipment): CO 2, CH 4, and N 2O Refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment: HFCs and PFCs Non-mechanical Drainage and tillage of soils: CO 2, CH 4, and N 2O Addition of synthetic ferti lizers, livestock waste, and crop residues to soils: CO 2, CH 4, and N 2O Addition of urea and lime to soils: CO 2 Enteric fermentation: CH 4 Rice cultivation: CH 4 Manure management: CH 4 and N 2O Land-use change : CO 2, CH 4, and N 2O Open burning of savannahs and of crop residues left on fields: CO 2, CH 4, and N 2O Managed woodland (e.g., tree strips, timberbelts ): CO 2 Composting of organic wastes: CH 4 Oxidation of horticultural growing media (e.g., peat): CO 2

Figure based on expert opinion of the Technical Working Group. 4.2 Individual agricultural sources Non-mechanical sources The non-mechanical sources that are globally largest in magnitude are: Enteric fermentation (CH 4) CH 4 is produced in herbivores as a by-product of enteric fermentation, whereby carbohydrates are broken down by bacteria in the digestive tract . The amount of CH 4 that is produced depends on:  The type of animal. Ruminant livestock have an expansive chamber, the rumen, which fosters extensive enteric fermentation and high CH 4 emissions. The main ruminant livestock are cattle, buffalo, goats , sheep, and deer. Non-ruminant livestock (horses, mules, donkeys) and monogastric li vestock (swine) have relatively lower CH 4 emissions.  Quantity and composition of feed. Generally, the higher the feed intake, the higher the CH 4 emissions.  Age and size of livestock. Feed intake incr eases with animal size, growth rate, and production (e.g., milk production, w ool growth, or pregnancy). Soil amendments and soil management (N 2O) Direct and indirect emissions of N 2O also occur from soils following increases in available N (see Box 4-1) from:  Synthetic N fertilizers and organic fertiliz ers (e.g., animal manure, compost, sewage sludge, and rendering waste).  Urine and dung that is deposited onto pastures, ranges and paddocks by grazing animals.  Incorporation of crop residue s into soils and N-fixati on by legumes. (Note: crop residue management and legume growing can reduce field fertilizer requirements and ultimately reduce overall soil N 2O emissions.)  N mineralisation associated with the loss of soil organic matter and caused by changes in land use or soil management, su ch as the drainage or management of organic soils (i .e. histosols). Manure management (CH 4 and N 2O) Manure management releases both CH 4 and N 2O, although the emissions of these GHGs are influenced by different factors. 

--- Page 28 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 28 CH 4 is emitted during the storage and treatmen t of manure under anaerobic conditions. It is most readily emitted when:  Large numbers of animals are managed in a confined area (e.g., dairy farms, beef feedlots, and swine and poultry farms).  When manure is stored or treated as a liquid (e.g., in lagoons, ponds, tanks, or pits). In contrast, when manure is handled as a soli d (e.g., in stacks or piles) or when it is deposited onto pastures and rangelands, it tends to decompose under more aerobic conditions, producing less CH 4. N 2O is emitted either directly or indirectly from stored or treated manures (see Box 4-1). N2O emissions are influenced by:  The N and C content of the manure, and the duration of storage and type of treatment.  Temperature and time - comparatively simple forms of organic N, such as urea (mammals) and uric acid (poultry) tend to lead to indirect N 2O emissions more quickly.  The leaching and run-off of N from treatment units.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 29 Box 4-1. Indirect and direct N 2O emissions from soils N2O emissions on farms are controlled by the suppl y of available N. Increases in available N, through the addition of fertilizers or animal wast es to soils, or from the storage and treatment of manure, stimulate denitrification and nitrification processes, which lead to N 2O emissions. The actual N 2O emissions may occur directly from the site of manure storage or fertilizer application, or they may occur indirectly, via leaching and volatilization . Volatilized N is ultimately deposited onto soils or onto the surface of lakes and other water bodies, where N 2O emissions then occur. Leached N leads to N 2O emissions in the groundwater below the farm and in ditches, rivers, estuaries, etc., that eventually recei ve the leachate. While indirect N 2O emissions may occur off the farm, they are accounted for in the same way as direct N 2O emissions in this Guidance. = Enhancement of denitrification and nitrif ication processes from increase in available N Rice cultivation The anaerobic decomposition of organic mate rial in flooded rice fields produces CH 4, which escapes to the atmosphere, mostly by transport through the rice plants. The CH 4 emissions will depend on the number and duration of crops grown, water regimes before and during the cultivation pe riod, and organic and inorgani c soil amendments. Soil type, temperature, and rice cultivar are also important.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 30 Soil liming Liming is used to reduce soil acidity and im prove plant growth. When added to soils, carbonate limes such as limestone (CaCO 3) or dolomite (CaMg(CO 3)2) dissolve and may release bicarbonate (HCO 3-), which then forms CO 2 through additional chemical reactions. Whether CO 2 is emitted and the amount of emissions depends on soil factors, climate regime, and the type of lime applied (i .e., limestone or dolomite, fine or course textured). Non-carbonate limes, such as oxide s (e.g., CaO) and hydroxides of lime, do not result in CO 2 emissions on farms, but their production causes CO 2 emissions from the breakdown of carbonate raw materials. Management of carbon pools The agricultural sector diffe rs profoundly from industrial s ectors in the importance of C pools, which may act either as sources or sinks of CO 2 during agricultu ral land use or LUC. These pools are of four main types (Figure 4-4):  Above-ground and below-ground bioma ss (e.g., trees, crops and roots).  Dead organic matter (DOM) in or on soils (i.e., decaying wood and leaf litter).  Soil organic matter. This category includes a ll non-living biomass th at is too fine to be recognized as dead organic matter.  Harvested products. Generally, this pool is short-lived in the agricultural sector as crop products are rapidly c onsumed following harvesting. Harvested wood products (HWPs) are a potential exception. It is possible to disaggrega te these pools further. For instance, the DOM and biomass pools can be subdivided into understory vegeta tion, standing dead tree, down dead tree, and litter pools, etc. This level of disaggregation may be useful depending on data availability and the intended accuracy of the inventory (see Chapter 8). Carbon stocks represent the quantity of C stored in pools. It may take C stocks decades to reach equilibrium following a change in farm management. Ultimately, for agricultural land as a whole to sequester C, the sum of all stock increases must exceed the sum of all stock decreases (i.e., the sum of all C gains through CO 2 fixation must exceed the sum of all C losses through CO 2 and CH 4 emissions and harvested products). Soil carbon pools Both organic and inorganic forms of C exist and are found in soils. However, agriculture has a larger impact on organic C pools, whic h are found in organic and mineral soils.  Organic C pools in organic soils. Organic so ils (e.g., those in peat and muck) have a high percentage of organic matter by ma ss and develop under the poorly drained conditions of wetlands when inputs of organic matter exceed losses of C from anaerobic decomposition. The drainage of orga nic soils to prepare land for agriculture leads to CO 2 emissions - emission rates vary by climate, with drainage under warmer conditions leading to faster decomposition rates. CO 2 emissions are also influenced by drainage depth, limin g, and the fertility and consistenc y of the organic substrate. 

--- Page 31 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 31  Organic C pools in mineral soils. All soils that are not organic soils are classified as mineral soils. They typically have relati vely low amounts of organic matter, occur under moderate to well drained conditions, and predominate in most ecosystems, except wetlands. The organic C stocks of mi neral soils can change if the net balance between C inputs and C losses from the soil is altered. C inputs can occur through the incorporation of biomass resi dues into soils after harvesti ng and fires, or through the direct additions of C in organic amendm ents. C losses are largely controlled by decomposition and are influenced by changes in moisture and temperature, soil properties and soil disturbance. Figure 4-4. Carbon pools in agriculture Mechanical sources The following categories of mechan ical sources exist on farms:  Stationary and mobile combustion sour ces. Stationary combustion sources are devices such as boilers, furnaces, and electric generators and are used to power a wide range of equipment, such as m illing and irrigation equipment. Mobile combustion sources are vehicles and mobile equipment, such as tractors, combine harvesters, and trucks. The CO 2 emissions from all combustion sources are primarily determined by the C content of the fuel used. In contrast, the CH 4 and 

--- Page 32 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 32 N2O emissions are primarily determined by the combustion and emissions control technologies present.  Purchased electricity. The associated emissions will depend on the mix of fuel types and technologies used on the grid concerned.  Refrigerant and air-conditioning equipment. These equipment leak refrigerants – high Global Warming Potential (GWP) GHGs - during installation, maintenance, operation and disposal. 4.3 Off-site emission sources beyond the farm gate The relative importance of different upstream and downstream processes will vary, depending on the proximity to markets (i.e . transportation dist ance), the amount of processing and packaging, and the type and volum e of farm inputs (esp ecially fertilizer). The following sources will be important for many types of farms: Fertilizer production The GHG emissions from fertiliz er production are closely li nked to energy consumption and vary with aspects of plant design and e fficiency, emissions c ontrol technologies, and raw material inputs. Three raw mate rials are particularly important: ‐ Ammonia. CO 2 is emitted from the consumption of hydrocarbons (primarily natural gas) as a hydrocarbon feedstock (t o supply H) and as an energy source. ‐ Nitric acid (HNO 3). Nitric acid production is th e largest industrial source of N 2O (IPCC 2006) and is emitted as a byproduct of the catalytic oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid. ‐ Phosphoric acid. Produced from reacting phos phate rock with sulphuric acid. The resultant emissions are mainly of CO 2, from fuel use and from the C compounds contained in the rock. To a large degree, the GHGs embedded in a fertilizer product will reflect the relative amounts of these ingredients. Feed production Globally, feed production accounts for 45% of the product-level GHG emissions across all types of livestock (Gerbe r et al., 2013). It is more important in the life cycle inventories of egg, chicken and pork, compared to those of milk and beef, where enteric fermentation dominates. Feed production em issions come from many of the sources described in Chapter 4.2; particularly, soil management, LUC, and fertilizer production, as well as electricity use dur ing drying and processing. Refrigeration Refrigeration is the major GHG-intensive co mponent of the downstream supply chain. Refrigeration emissions occur during initial chilling, transport, storage, catering and retail. Limited data are available, but th is “cold chain” coul d account for about one percent of global GHG emissions (James and James, 2010).

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 33 Part 2: DEVELOPING CORPORATE INVENTORIES 

--- Page 34 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 34 Chapter 5: Setting Inventory Boundaries Agricultural companies vary tremendously in terms of their organizational structures and business operations. Common examples include the degree of vertical integration, the types of leases entered into for land and equipment, and the manner in which agricultural products are sold off the farm. This variation poses a challenge to ensuring that emissions sources are included in inventories in a cons istent way over time, both within and across companies. Fortunately, specific approaches are available to help companies determine which sources should be included – th ese approaches relate to setting inventory boundaries . This chapter:  Describes approaches for setting orga nizational boundaries to determine which business operations should be included in an inventory.  Describes approaches for se tting operational boundaries that define whether and how emissions sources associated with these operations should be reported in inventories. Summary of requirements and main recommendations:  Companies shall separately account fo r and report on scope 1 and 2 at a minimum.  When setting operational boundaries, compan ies should take appropriate account of production contracts and other forms of agricultural contracting, land and equipment leases, and membership of co-operatives. 5.1 Setting organizational boundaries Organizational boundaries determine which land and operating facilities, such as barns and processing plants (collectively termed ‘operations’ in this Guidance), shall be included in an inventory. Three ‘consolid ation’ approaches can be used to set organizational boundaries: 1. Operational control . A company accounts for 100% of the GHG fluxes to/from an operation over which it has the authority to introduce and implement its own operating policies. 2. Financial control . A company accounts for 100% of the fluxes to/from an operation over which it has the ability to direct fina ncial and operating polic ies with a view to gaining economic benefits. 3. Equity-share approach . A company accounts for the fluxes to/from an operation according to its share of equity (or percenta ge of economic interest) in that operation. Various criteria can be used by companies to determine if they exert operational control of an operation. For instance, operati onal control would be held if: • The operation is operated by the reporti ng company, whether for itself or under a contractual obligati on to other owners or partic ipants in the operation. 

--- Page 35 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 35 • The operation is operated by a joint venture (or equivalent), in respect of which the reporting company has the ability to de termine management and board-level decisions of the joint venture. • The reporting company holds an operating license. • The reporting company sets environmen tal, health and safety policies. A company must use only one consolidation a pproach (and related cr iterion) in creating an inventory, although it may choose to crea te multiple inventories using different approaches. Many agricultural bus inesses are organized as sole proprietorships or family businesses and their organizational bounda ries will be correspondingly simple. As business structures become more complex, organizational boundaries will become more valuable in ensuring consistent accounti ng practices. Exactly which agricultural operations are included in an inventory will depend on the business structures involved and the chosen consolidation approach (Table 5-1). For example, the member-patrons of a co-operative would not account for any of th at co-operative’s fluxes under the financial control approach, but they would account for those fluxe s under the equity share approach (Table 5-1). Figure 5-1 illustrates the application of organizational boundaries for different accounting categories. Co-operatives are considered furt her in Chapter 5.2. This Guidance makes no recommendations a bout which consolidation approach should be used in the sector. Rather, many companie s will likely need to consider a range of factors when selecting an approach and that selection should be based on the reporting company’s business goals for GHG reporting (Tab le 5-2). For instance, a company with a large cattle feedlot may fall under the ju risdiction of a mandatory GHG reporting program. Because compliance with such program s typically rests with the operators of emission sources, the company may choose the operational cont rol approach to streamline its reporting processes. In general, sole proprietorships will typically find the operational control the most straightforward approach to apply, while companies with other business structures may prefer any of the three appr oaches based on their specific business goals.

The size of the wine company’s inventory depends on the consolidation approach used.

These boundaries define whether an emission source is direct (i.e., is controlled or owned by the reporting company) or indire ct (i.e., owned or controll ed by another company, but a portion of whose emissions are a consequence of the activities of the reporting company). Emission sources are further cl assified by scope (Box 1-1):  Scope 1: All direct sources  Scope 2: Consumption of purchased heat, st eam and electricity (a n indirect source)  Scope 3: All other indirect sources All scope 1 and 2 sources shall be reported in an inventory. Scope 3 sources are optional under the Corporate Standard, although it is recommended to measure and report significant scope 3 sources (see Chapter 9.3). Also, with the exception of LUC, all CO 2 fluxes to/from C pools that are owned or c ontrolled by the reporting company should be reported separately from the scopes in a sp ecial ‘Biogenic Carbon’ category. Biogenic CO 2 fluxes are considered further in Chapters 8 and 9. 

--- Page 38 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 38 What factors affect how oper ational boundaries are set? Companies may encounter the following fact ors for consideration when determining which scope a given source falls under: 1. Production contracts Agricultural products can be sold in va rious ways, including production contracts, marketing contracts and spot markets (Figur e 5-2). Production contracts are distinct in that they are agreements between contract ors (often called growers) and contractees (often called integrators) that cede some m easure of control over the production process to the integrator. The contract specifies: (1 ) the services to be provided by the grower (e.g., fertilizer application schedules, husbandr y conditions); (2) the manner in which the grower is to be compensated for the services ; and (3) specific inte grator responsibilities for the provision of any inputs. There are ma ny different types of production contracts, which vary according to whether the integrator or grower owns the product during production; whether the terms of the contract are non-negotiabl e; and the extent to which the integrator provides inputs. For the purposes of reporting under this Guidance, growers are assumed to retain operational control over the contracted produc tion and should therefore account for 100% of the associated emissions under scope 1 or 2 using the operationa l control approach. The accounting under financial or equity share a pproaches may differ. In particular, if the integrator has established multi-year contra cts with individual growers and provides extensive inputs, the integrators and grower s should each then account for a portion of the emissions according to their share of investments in the production process. Figure 5-2. Primary sales routes for agricultural products 2. Other forms of agric ultural contracting While companies can enter into production cont racts that require them to raise livestock or grow crops for third parties, they may enter into other ty pes of contracts that require third parties to perform agricultural activiti es on their own behalf . These activities may take place either on or off the reporting companies’ farmland. 

--- Page 39 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 39 On-farm activities: Companies may contract third partie s to perform a subset of farming activities, such as harvesting or fertilizer application (s ee the example of service co- operatives below). At the other end of the spectrum, landowners may enter into custom farming contracts under which contract operators supply all the labor and equipment needed to perform tillage, planting, pest contro l, harvesting, crop storage, and other farm functions. With the exception of contractor-owned equipmen t, the on-farm sources are scope 3 for the contractor and scope 1 for the producer/landowner, under both the operational and financial control approaches. Off-farm activities: Many different arrangements exist for the grazing or feeding of a company’s livestock on a third party’s land. Examples include feedlots and ajistments6. While the livestock are on the third party’ s land, the agricultural emissions (e.g., CH 4 emissions from enteric fermentation and ma nure management) are scope 1 for the third party and scope 3 for the producer, under both the operational a nd financial control approaches. 3. Leases for land and equipment The Corporate Standard ( Appendix F ) distinguishes between two general types of leases:  Capital (or financial) leases: This type of lease enables the lessee to operate an asset and also gives the lessee all the risks and re wards of owning that asset. In a capital lease the lessee has use of the asset over most of its useful life. Assets leased under a capital or financial lease ar e considered wholly-owned a ssets in financial accounting and are recorded as such on the balance sheet.  Operational leases: This type of lease enable s the lessee to operate an asset, such as a building or a vehicle, but does not give th e lessee any of the risks or rewards of owning that asset. In an operating lease the lessee only has use of the asset for some of its useful life. Any lease th at is not a capital or financia l lease is an operating lease. Whether leased assets are scope 1 or 3 for the reporting company depends on the approach chosen to set organizational boundari es and on the type of leasing arrangement (see Table 5-3 and Table 5-4). Land leases and operational control For the purposes of reporting under this Gu idance, the reporting company is considered to exert operational control of any land it leases (Table 5-3). This is true, regardless of the form of rent payment (cash, crops, or both) , the amount of resour ces contributed by the landlord, or the extent to which the landlor d is involved in management decisions. For instance, permits for the lease of nationa l-owned grazing lands from governments might contain requirements related to resting periods and reseeding. The lessee retains operational control of th e land in these cases. 6 Ajistments are typically defined for a shorter period of time than pasture or grazing leases, which are considered separately in “Leases for land and equipment”

Membership of co-operatives A co-operative is a business that is owned and controlled by the member organizations that use its services and w hose benefits are shared by the members on the basis of use (Table 5-1). Agricultural co-operatives take many forms, but can broadly be grouped into marketing, purchasing, and service co-operatives (Table 5-5). Accounting under the equity share approach. Ma ny producers will have a relatively small percentage patronage of their co-operative and need not account for its emissions under the equity share approach. However, some producers may have a si gnificant percentage patronage and should account for a correspondin g percentage of the co-operative’s scope 1, scope 2, and (optionally) sc ope 3 emissions under the equity share approach. Note that the nature of the emissions source will vary wi dely depending on the type of co-operative 

--- Page 41 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 41 (see Table 5-5). For instance, the members of a purchasing co-operative would have scope 1 emissions relating to the ma nufacture of feed and fertilizer. Accounting under either contro l approach. A Co-operative does not fall within the organizational boundaries of its members and only the co-operative itself should account for its emissions under scope 1 and 2. I ndividual members may account for certain emissions under scope 3 should those arise fr om activities conducted by the co-operative specifically on their own behalf (and not on that of other members).

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 42 Chapter 6: Tracking GHG fluxes over Time Setting and using base periods is a fundamental step in de signing GHG inventories. They help companies compare performance against a point in the past and they put the effects of changes in inventory met hodologies into context, allowi ng meaningful and consistent comparisons of performance over time. Ag ricultural activities and environmental conditions that affect GHG fluxes can change a lot over time. Also, structural changes such as acquisitions, divestments, and merger s, can affect the types of operations that need to be reported in inventories. Companie s need to take these changes into account whilst setting and us ing base periods. This chapter:  Details requirements and recommendati ons for choosing a base period and for recalculating base period data to ensure historical comparisons are meaningful. Summary of requirements and main recommendations:  Companies shall choose and establish a ba se period, and specify the reasons for choosing that period.  The base period shall be the earliest poin t in time for which verifiable data are available on scope 1 and scope 2 emissions.  Multi-year base periods are r ecommended for many companies.  Companies shall develop a base period em issions recalculation policy, and clearly articulate the basis and context for any recalculations. If a pplicable, the policy shall state any “significant threshold”.  Companies shall recalculate the base pe riod inventory to reflect changes in organizational structures or calculation methods, or the discovery of errors, which significantly impact the base period inventory. 6.1 Setting base periods The base period is the period in history ag ainst which an organization’s GHG fluxes are tracked over time7. Both the Corporate Standard and this Guidance require companies to establish a base period. Companies shall use as a base period the earliest relevant point in time for which they have verifiable data on scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. Critically, the base period should be repres entative of a company’s GHG profile. This has several implications: Base periods shall not be less than one year The base period should not be an individual crop year or production season (for livestock) that is less than one year. Othe rwise, the effects of seasonal management activities may not be reflected in the base period. For instan ce, tillage practices, winter cover crops and double cropping systems can cau se emissions outside of the growing 7 The Corporate Standard uses the term ‘base year’ instead of ‘base period.’ The latter term is used here to avoid confusion because base periods may comprise more than one year.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 43 season. Also, the length of crop years and pr oduction seasons will vary between regions, potentially compromising the comparability of data from different facilities owned by the reporting company. Multi-year base periods are recommended Oftentimes, individual years wi ll not serve as representative base periods (see Table 6.1 for examples). In such cases, companie s should average GHG flux data from multiple, consecutive years to form a more representati ve base period. In general, this Guidance recommends at least a three-year base pe riod, which is often sufficient to smooth over inter-annual variability. If a base year has already been se t for non-agricultural emissions, then a multi-year base period can be centered on that year. Many calculation methodologies (e.g., Tier 1 IPCC methodologies; see Chapter 7.3) do not capture the effects of climate or envi ronmental change on GHG fluxes. Instead, they only pick up changes in activ ity data (e.g., number of hectares farmed, number of cattle raised, amount of fertilizer used, etc.). As a result, if management practices in an individual year are representativ e, it may be appropriate to se lect that year as the base period. Table 6-1. Examples of when an individual year may not serve as a representative base period Why is the selected base period atypical? Examples Changes in environmental conditions occur that are beyond the control of the company and that cause the base period inventory to depart significantly from typical GHG flux profiles During a single growing season, a heat wave increases irrigation and therefore fuel use requirements Atypical or episodic changes in farming practices Coppiced woodland is returned to crop production Forest is cleared for agricultural production Agricultural activities vary cyclically over a set period of years, such that activities (and corresponding GHG fluxes) in one year differ from those in other years within the same cycle A multi-year multiple crop rotation Coppicing of short-rotation woody crops (e.g., a row of willows that is harvested every three years) Rotational applications of lime Rolling base periods may be useful Rolling base periods are base periods that move fo rward in time with each reporting period. They are useful because long-term environmental trends, such as changes in precipitation and temperature that accompa ny climate change, can affect agricultural GHG fluxes. As a result, the more widely sepa rated the current repor ting period is from a fixed base period, the more like ly it is that at least some of the difference in GHG fluxes between the two periods is due to these trends. Therefore, companies may use a rolling base period to help minimize the influence of th ese long-term trends and ensure that inventories are more useful as a basis for tracking the impacts of management practices. 

--- Page 44 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 44 Using a rolling base period involves moving th e base period forward with each reporting period (Figure 6-1). One disadvantage to rolling base periods is th at they do not allow reduction targets to be expressed as a percentage reduction relative to a fixed point in the past, which is the most common form of expressing reduction targets. Figure 6-1. The concept of rolling base periods 6.2 Recalculating base period inventories. To ensure consistent tracking of GHG fluxes over time, the base period inventory shall be recalculated when changes occur to the i nventory boundaries or i nventory development process that would significantly impact the ba se inventory. These changes include:  Structural changes that transfer the owne rship or control of operations from one company to another as long as those operati ons existed in the base period of the reporting company. Examples: mergers, acq uisitions, and divestments (see Figure 6-2).  Changes in calculation methodologies. Ex ample: the use of improved emission factors.  The discovery of errors that are signifi cant on their own or collectively. Example: the discovery of errors in activity data. In determining whether changes are signi ficant, companies should set significance thresholds (i.e., changes are cumulatively sign ificant if they cause a change that exceeds x% of the base period inve ntory). The GHG Protocol does not define significance thresholds, although many GHG reporting programs do provide recommended thresholds. Once defined, a significance thre shold should be applied consistently over time. 012345 123456 012345 123456 Before rolling of base period After rolling of base period Amount of GHG flux Base period Current reporting period

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 45 Figure 6-2. Recalculating base period inventorie s for structural changes. Here, the reporting company acquires a business at the beginning of year 3. The emissions from that business during year 3 are reflected in the reporting company’s inventory for that year, but the inventories for th e base period and year 2 are recalculated to include the acquired business’s emissions during those two years. Changes that do not trigger recalculations  Organic growth or decline. Organic growth and decline is defined as increases or decreases in production output, changes in pr oduct mix, or closures and openings of operating units that are owned or controll ed by the reporting company. For instance, an egg producer would experience organic growth if it increased production, perhaps by building a new facility, but it would not experience organic growth if it bought out a pre-existing facility. Changes in th e amount of land leased by a company are also considered organic change and do not tr igger recalculations, even if that action substantially increase s production levels.  The acquisition (or insourcing) of an operation that did not exist in the base period of the reporting company.  Operational changes, such as switching from a feedlot to a rotational grazing operation, assuming both operations are owned or controlled by the reporting company.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 46 Chapter 7: Calculating GHG Fluxes Calculating GHG fluxes can be the most challe nging part of devel oping GHG inventories in the agricultural sector. Companies should first identify the management practices and emissions sources that would need to be refl ected in their inventories (see Chapter 4 and Chapter 5), before selecting a calculation appr oach. This selection is a key step, because the likely accuracy of GHG flux data and the ty pes of activity data needed vary widely amongst approaches. Figure 7-1 shows the general process for calculating GHG fluxes. Figure 7-1. General process for ca lculating GHG flux data. This chapter:  Describes the types of activ ity data typically needed to calculate GHG fluxes.  Provides guidance on prioritizing emissi ons sources for data collection.  Describes the general approaches fo r calculating the GHG fluxes to/from agricultural, especially non-mechanical, sources.  Describes criteria that are useful in selecting specific calculation tools.  Describes common sources of uncertainty in calculating GHG data that offer opportunities for improving inventory quality. Calculation approach GHG flux data Activity data: Data on farm production (e.g., number of livestock grown ) Data on environmental factors (e.g., soil type, climate, and weather) Data on farm inputs (e.g., amount of fertilizer used )

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 47 Summary of requirements and main recommendations:  When high-quality activity da ta are not available for a ll of the emissions sources that need to be included in an invent ory, companies should prioritize their data collection efforts based on source magnitude.  Companies should select a calculation appr oach that best meets their objectives for compiling an inventory and the GHG accounting and reporting principles.  When managing inventory quality, companies should focus on reducing parameter uncertainty.  Information on GHG data uncertainty s hould be reported in inventories. Note: Prior to calculating GHG fluxes, comp anies should also consult Chapter 8, which details the specific types of C stock changes that should be included in an inventory and for which calculations are therefore recommended. 7.1 Collecting activity data Activity data can often be collected from ex isting data records held by producers, such as: invoices, electricity meters, crop insurance records, field records of tractor passes and crop operations, production records, land registry records, nutrient management plans, and livestock movement records. To the extent possible, these record s should be used to reduce the GHG reporting burden and improve the a udit trail. In general, data on energy consumption, procurement and production leve ls can often be obtained from high quality sources. In contrast, reliable data on land ma nagement practices and LUC can be more difficult to obtain. Table 7-1 summarizes common types of required activity data. Companies should consult individual calculatio n tools to determine their exact data requirements. It is recommended that larg e operations with geographically separated facilities should standardize inventory procedures and keep central records. Common challenges Certain challenges are commonly encountered when collecting activity data (Table 7-2). Companies should be mindful of these ch allenges when designing inventories and inventory quality management plans.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 50 7.2 Guidance for prioritizing data collection efforts It may not always be possible to collect high quality activity data for all of the emissions sources that need to be incl uded in an inventory. As a re sult, data collection efforts should be prioritized. Companies should prioritize data collection efforts for key sources Key sources are those that are expected to have the highest GHG fl uxes, offer the most emissions reduction potential, and are most relevant to the company’s business goals (Table 7-3). The identification of key sour ces should take into account the range of different GHGs emitted from individual sources, because of the potential for trade-offs in GHG fluxes (see Chapter 7.3) and also because companies might have different amounts of control over the different sources. Collect ing higher quality data for key sources will allow companies to more effectively set re duction targets and track and demonstrate progress over time, while making the most e fficient use of available resources. For the same reasons, the key sources should also be subject to the most accurate quantification methods and the focus of quality anal ysis/quality control procedures. Table 7-3. Criteria for prioritizing data collection efforts Criterion Application to source (or sink) Magnitude of GHG flux The source (or sink) is large (or believed to be large) relative to most other sources Trends in magnitude There is a documented increase or decrease in the size of the source over time or a projected trend based on project ed changes in agricultural practices Uncertainty of GHG flux estimates The uncertainty of the GHG fluxes is (or is believed to be) large Degree of control There are potential emissions reducti ons that could be undertaken or influenced by the reporting company Risk The source contributes to the company’s risk exposure (e.g., climate change related risks such as financial, regulatory, supply chain, product and customer, litigation, and reputational risks) Stakeholders The source is deemed critical by key stakeholders (e.g., customers, suppliers, investors or civil society) Sector Guidance The source has been identified as si gnificant by sector-specific guidance Other The source meets any additional criteria developed by the company or sector Identifying key sources based on the m agnitude of GHG fluxes is preferred The most rigorous approach to identifying key sources is to use quantitative data to rank the size of different sources (and sink s). This approach has three steps: 1. Obtain GHG flux data. Preferentially, comp anies would use data from the latest available inventory, although cer tain sources will fluctuate in magnitude from one inventory period to another. Altern atively, companies may use initial GHG estimation (or screening) methods to estimate the fluxes for each source (e.g., by 

--- Page 51 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 51 using industry-average data, LCA studies of different food or bi ofuel products, or rough estimates). 2. Rank all sources from largest to smallest according to their estimated GHG fluxes. Removals should be listed as abso lute values (i.e. no negative sign) to allow the proper identification of significant sinks. 3. Apply a pre-determined, percentage cumu lative threshold. Key sources are then those that together add up to a certai n percentage of the overall emissions (e.g., key sources are cumulatively respon sible for 70% of GHG fluxes). Trends in magnitude are also us eful for identifying key sources In addition to ranking sources for a given inventory period, it may al so be useful to rank sources based on the percentage change in fluxes over time (e .g., between the base period and the latest inventory period), if da ta are available. Percentage change in GHG flux ൌlatest inventory estimat eെbase period estimate absolute value of base period estimateݔ100% This analysis is helpful because it can identify sources whose trend is different from that of the overall inventory. Companies may choos e not to invest addi tional resources in estimating emissions that show a declini ng trend (or sequestra tion that shows an increasing trend), especially if these trends result from the introduction of mitigation measures. However, prioritizing these sour ces is still recommended to help ensure inventories reflect mitigation efforts as much as possible. Companies may likewise chose to invest more in categories whose fluxes show large increases. Companies should not exclude small or highly uncertain emissions sources In general, companies should not exclude required emissions sources from their inventories as a result of uncertainty. Instea d, to ensure the relevance and completeness of the inventory, companies may decide to use a less accurate approach for emissions sources that are expected to be relatively less significant, as long as the inventory is transparent about the limitations of the calculation approach es used (see Chapter 9). For instance, while fuel use will often comprise a small share of the inventory of a ranching operation, it should still be in cluded in the inventory, but may be estimated based on simplified assumptions. Can ‘materiality thresholds’ be used? Th ese are minimum GHG accounting thresholds that state that when a given source is sma ller than the threshold size it can be omitted from the inventory. Although it appears useful in theory, the practic al implementation of such a threshold is not compatible with the completeness principle of this Guidance. In order to use a materiality threshold, the emi ssions from a particular source or activity would have to be quantified to ensure th ey were under the threshold. However, once emissions are quantified, mo st of the benefit of ha ving a threshold is lost.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 52 7.3 Selecting a calculation approach GHG fluxes can be determined in differen t ways, ranging from the use of highly specialized, field-scale measurement equi pment to global emission factors. This Guidance does not require or recommend the use of a specific calculation approach or tool. Instead companies should select an appr oach that best meets their objectives for compiling an inventory and that meets the GHG accounting and reporti ng principles (see Chapter 3 and below). The distinction between mechanical and non-mechanical sources becomes paramount when calculating GHG fluxes and the associated levels of uncertainty. In general, GHG fluxes for mechanical sources can be calculate d with higher accuracy. This is especially true of mobile and stationary source s, whose emissions are primarily of CO 2 and can be calculated based on only a few items of informa tion – mostly the type and amount of fuel used. In contrast, the GHG fluxes to/from non-mechanical sources depend on complex interactions between management practices and variable environmental conditions. As a result, GHG flux data for these sources ar e likely to have much higher uncertainty, regardless of the calculation approach chosen. This difference has important implications for how these data should be reporte d in inventories (see Chapter 9). Because calculation tools for mechanical t ools are widely available (e.g., from GHG reporting programs), this section will focus on non-mechanical sources. How are GHG fluxes calculated for non-mechanical sources? Broadly, four different types of calculation approaches can be used for non-mechanical sources (Table 7-4):  Field measurements  Emission factors  Empirical models and process-based models Field measurements Many, but not all, GHG emission sources in ag riculture can be measured using either direct or indirect measuremen t techniques. Direct techniques include controlled livestock chambers that measure the CH 4 emissions from enteric fermentation, flux chambers that measure the N 2O and CO 2 emissions from plots of land, a nd gas flux meters that measure the CH 4 emissions from certain livestock wa ste management systems (e.g., covered anaerobic lagoons). Indirect t echniques include the measurement of carbon stocks before and after a change in management practices or land use. Indirect techniques are often much simpler and easier, but may require additi onal planning ahead of time to capture the ‘before’ scenario. While useful for research, both direct and indirect techniques are often far too costly for developing corporate inventories. Emission factors The simplest approach involves the multipli cation of management activity data by a relevant emission factor, which is a coeffi cient describing the amount of GHG flux per 

--- Page 53 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 53 unit of activity. For instance, to calculate the CH 4 emissions from enteric fermentation, emissions may be estimated by multiplying the number of dairy cattle by an emission factor that specifies how much CH 4 is emitted per head of dairy cattle. The accuracy of this approach depends not only on the accuracy of the activity data, but also on how specific the factor is to the specific co mbination of environmental factors and management activities concerned. Default emi ssion factors are largely either based on field measurements at individual research site s or represent average values across a range of sites. Empirical and process-based models Empirical models use field measurements to develop statistical relationships between GHG fluxes and agricultural management factor s. In turn, process-based (or mechanistic) models mathematically link important bi ogeochemical processes that control the production, consumption, and emission of GHGs. Some models may only require one or several inputs to estimate GHG fluxes; others might have extensive data requirements that span different spatial and temporal scal es. Input data can be physical variables such as temperature, precipitation, elevation, and so il nutrient levels, or biological variables such as soil microbial activity and plant divers ity. The accuracy of models is variable and depends on the robustness of the model and the accuracy of the inputs. For instance, if a model is used in a new agro-climate regime for which it was not previously calibrated, the model may not be reliable. GHG fluxes can also be calcula ted using any combination of the above approaches. For instance, empirical or process models could be used to derive more specific emission factors. The resulting hybrid approaches can increase the accuracy and practicability of calculating emissions. No one approach is ideal The calculation approaches differ in how they map onto the various tiers defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for the purposes of national inventory reporting (see Box 7- 1). In general, emission factors and empirical models (IPCC Tiers 1 and 2) are the easiest and least resource-intensive approaches to use. But they are not very effective in capturing the geographical variation in the biophysical processes that underpin GHG fluxes and they may not be sensitive to many changes in farm management practices. As a result, they tend to become less accurate as spatial resolution increases from a regi onal or national level to a lo cal or farm-level. And their use may mask much of the variation in performance that exists amongst farms. Emission factors and empirical models also tend to focus on individual emission sources and management practices one at a time. This is a problem because non-mechanical sources are often connected by complex flow s of N and C through farms, such that management activities have non-additi ve GHG effects. For example, soil N 2O emissions are affected not only by fertil izer application regimes, but also by tillage, soil pH management, irrigation, and drai nage practices. As a result, the GHG impact of different agricultural practices is best evaluated si multaneously and at the whole farm-level. 

--- Page 54 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 54 In contrast to emission fact ors and empirical models, fiel d measurements (Tier 3) and process models (IPCC Tiers 2 and 3) inte grate and link multiple sources, allowing a whole farm analysis of GHG fluxes. They are therefore particularly suited to understanding trade-offs in the emissions of different GHGs (see Box 7-2). However, the use of field measurements and process models can require expertise, data and time that will often not be available. Companies may choose to use different a pproaches for different activities. Box 7-1. IPCC Methodologies for Nationa l GHG Emissions Inventories The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has developed a comprehensive set of methodologies - the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories* - to guide the preparation of national inventories. Many of the tools listed in Appendix III rely on some portion of these Gu idelines, especially the default emission factors and calculation formulae. The Guidelines define three general tiers of methodologies based on their complexity and data requirements. The choice of tier de pends, in part, on the significance of the emissions sources under consideration.  Tier 1: Simple, emission factor-based approach. Tier 1 emission factors are international defaults, although they will of ten have been based on studies conducted in a select few (mostly temperate) countries.  Tier 2: More region-specific emission factors or more refined empirical estimation methodologies.  Tier 3: Dynamic bio-geophysical simulation models using multi-year time series and context-specific parameterization. These tiers provide a useful means for cate gorizing and understanding the likely accuracy of the different calculation me thods that are available. In general, Tier 3 methods are considered most accurate and Ti er 1 methods least accurate. * http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 56 Box 7-2. GHG trade-offs and the value of a whole-farm approach to calculating GHG fluxes Mitigation options or best management pr actices (BMPs) intr oduced to reduce the emissions of one GHG can sometimes increase those of others. Some examples include:  Measures taken to enhance soil C se questration (e.g., no till-practices, the recovery of degraded pasture, or in creased irrigation) can increase soil N 2O emissions because of increased soil mo isture content, a supply of easily mineralizable N, and/or reduced soil aeration.  Wooded riparian buffer zones can increase C sequestrati on but lead to increased soil N 2O emissions, compared to field margins.  Constructed wetlands can se quester C over long time pe riods, but can also emit CH 4.  Aerating a manure lagoon to reduce CH 4 emissions will increase N 2O emissions.  Removal of straw from fl ooded rice paddies to reduce CH 4 emissions can lead to the requirement for more fertilizer and increased N 2O emissions.  Leaving sugarcane residue on fields can increase soil C sequestration but also increase CH 4 emissions.  The winter use of restricted gr azing systems and stand-off pads – purpose built, drained resting surfaces to hold livestock over wet periods – to reduce soil N 2O emissions and N leaching can increase CH 4 emissions.  The application of N-transformation inhibi tors to soils to reduce the leaching of some N 2O precursors may increase that of others. These examples demonstrate the need to identify trade-offs and consider multiple emissions sources and GHGs in tandem when evaluating possible mitigation measures. A whole-systems approach avoids potentially ill-advised practices based on preoccupation with one individual GHG or practice. What tools are available fo r calculating GHG fluxes? There are an increasing number of publicly available tools - spreadsheets, software and protocols - for calculating GHG fluxes base d on emission factors, models or a combination of these approaches. Appendix III provides a non-exhaustive list of such tools. Most of the more accessi ble and user-friendly tools that would be most amenable to use by farm managers tend to implement Tier 1 or Tier 2 approaches. Unfortunately, process-oriented models are often unwieldy to use, although more user-friendly interfaces are available or under construction for some process models and specifically intended for use by farm managers, extension agents, and consultants. These offer the most potential for accurately calculating farm-level GHG fluxes, at least in regions for which background, calibrating data sets are available. Tools should be evaluated agai nst a range of criteria This Guidance does not recommend speci fic tools for calculating GHG fluxes – companies should instead select tools that best allow them to meet their objectives for

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 57 compiling an inventory and the GHG accounting and reporting principles. In evaluating individual tools, companies should cons ider a range of questions, including:  Is the tool comprehensive in terms of its coverage of different emission sources, GHGs and management activities, particularly those that are practiced or planned on the farm? And does it integrate the effects of multiple management activities across the farm?  What input data are required and will farm managers be able to provide these data?  How much labor and technical exper tise is required to use the tool?  Is the tool transparent ab out its methodology, including limitations and assumptions?  Is the tool geographically repr esentative? Is it tailored to the region/area of interest?  Is the tool accurate enough to help meet the business objectives for compiling an inventory?  Is the tool up-to-date (e.g., are emi ssions factors updated on an annual basis)?  Does the tool provide estimates of uncertainty?  Does the tool have verifications functions (e.g., are ranges enforced for the values of activity data)?  Can the tool quantify environmental imp acts other than GHG fluxes (e.g., nitrate or phosphorus pollution)?  Can the tool quantify GHG performance metrics?  Is the tool otherwise consistent with the GHG accounting principles? Figure 7-2 outlines a decision tree for choos ing a tool based on core questions.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 58 Figure 7-2. Decision tree for choosing a GHG emissions calculation tool. 7.4 Uncertainty in activity and GHG flux data The GHG fluxes to/from agricultu ral sources – and especially non-mechanical sources - are inevitably estimated with some degr ee of uncertainty. Id entifying sources of uncertainty can help companies understand th e steps required to improve the inventory quality and the level of confidence users s hould have in both the inventory results and any estimates of emissions reductions from changes in farming practices. Two types of uncertainty affect GHG flux estimations 1.Model uncertainty. This refers to intrinsic limitations in the ability of the calculation approach to reflect real worl d conditions. Such uncertainty is particularly important for non-mechanical sources whose GHG fluxe s are often determined by complex interactions between biol ogical processes (e.g., nitrif ication and decomposition), environmental factors (e.g., temperature, ra infall, soil pH), and management practices. Failure to reflect these interactions accurate ly in the calculation approach can lead to significant divergence between actual and calculated values. For some sources it may not be possible to improve accu racy until science has refined the calculation approach (i.e. until the model uncertainty has been reduced to an acceptable level).

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 59 2.Parameter uncertainty. This is a measure of how close the data us ed to calculate the inventory results (e.g., activity data and emission factors) are to the true (though unknown) actual data and GHG fluxes. Parame ter uncertainties can be evaluated through statistical analysis, measurement equipment, precision determinations, and expert judgment. Together, these sources of uncertainty affect whether GHG data are accurate enough to meet the business goals that are driving invent ory development or to determine if changes in GHG fluxes are the result of management changes. Companies should focus on parameter uncertainty In general, understanding parameter uncertain ty will be the primary focus of companies in managing inventory quality. This is becau se most companies will lack the technical capacity to estimate model uncertainty, while mo st companies should be able to estimate parameter uncertainty. As far as is possibl e, companies should identify and track key uncertainty sources throughout the inventory process and iteratively check whether the uncertainty of the results is adequate for the company’s business goals. The GHG Protocol does not define acceptable uncertain ty levels. However, if the uncertainty bounds are asymmetrical, the larger uncertainty should be used to remain conservative. Parameter uncertainty can be quantified ba sed on one or more the following: • Measured uncertainty (represented by standard deviations) • The pedigree matrix approach, based on data quality indicators (DQIs) 8 • Default uncertainties for specific activities or sector data (reported in various literature) • Probability distributions fr om commercial databases • Uncertainty factors reported in literature • Other approaches reported by literature Uncertainty data for emission factors will of ten be available. For instance, the IPCC typically provides uncertainty bounds for its Tier 1 emission factors. The GHG Protocol’s Quantitative Inventory Uncertainty tool 9 provides more information on assessing the overall uncertainty of an i nventory and the contribution of each data element to this uncertainty. Information on uncertainty should be reported Uncertainty can be reported in many ways, in cluding through qualitati ve descriptions of uncertainty sources, and quantitative represen tations, such as error bars, histograms, probability density functions, etc. It is useful to provide as complete a disclosure of uncertainty information as is possible. Users of the information may then weigh the total set of information provided in judging their confidence in the information. 8 The use of DQIs involves rating individual data points against a range of quality criteria, such as precision and geographical representativeness. 9 http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 60 Chapter 8: Accounting for Carbon Stocks Agricultural systems contain C in above-g round and below-ground biomass, dead organic matter (DOM), soil organic matter, and harv ested products (Chapter 4.2). These C stocks are reversible - any C sequestered in C stocks will eventually be emitted to the atmosphere. Also, changes in C stocks can ta ke decades to reach equilibrium following a change in farm management or land use. Th ese special features of agriculture have important implications for whether and how C stocks should be included within GHG inventories. This chapter:  Describes how changes in C stocks should be reported in terms of CO 2 fluxes.  Describes the types of CO 2 fluxes that should / s hould not be included in inventories.  Describes how the CO 2 fluxes from long-term changes in C stocks can be spread over multiple reporting periods. Summary of requirements and main recommendations:  Companies should report the net CO 2 fluxes (in tonnes CO 2) to/from organic C stocks in mineral/organic soils and above-ground and below-ground woody biomass, as well as the CO 2 emissions from DOM and biomass combustion.  Natural disturbances, Payments for Environmental Services (PESs), and conservation areas should be accounted fo r equivalently to other agricultural activities.  Companies should use peer -reviewed methods for CO 2 flux calculations.  When relevant, companies should amortize changes in C stocks evenly over time using a fixed-rate approach.  Companies should account for historical changes in land use or management occurring on or afte r the base period. 8.1 Including flux and stock data in inventories Companies should report net CO 2 flux data Because of the reversibility of C stocks, cha nges to C stocks can be quantified using data on:  Stock size, when measured in units of mass of C (e.g., metric tonnes C/ha) at two points in time; or  The net balance of CO 2 emissions and CO 2 removals (‘net fluxes’) to or from a stock, measured in units of mass of CO 2. Both approaches are equally valid. Under ei ther, companies should take care to use methods that treat soil depth consistently, particularly in the context of LUC. For instance, reference stock values might be available for soil C stocks in forest and

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 61 cropland - if these are not de fined to a consistent depth10, some of the estimated stock difference will reflect methodological differe nces rather than actual variation. While companies should report net CO 2 flux data, they may also report data on stock size (when available) to provide us eful context for interpreting inventory results. Stock size data can be converted to net flux data by multiplying the mass of stock change by ସସ ଵଶ, which is the ratio of th e molecular weights of CO 2 and elemental carbon. Companies should use peer-reviewed methods for CO 2 flux calculations This Guidance does not prescribe speci fic methodologies for calculating the CO 2 fluxes to/from C stocks. Any of the general approach es detailed in Chapter 7.3 may be used, as long as the underlying methodology has been scientifically vetted (i.e., has undergone peer review). Appendix III lists many, scie ntifically published and well established calculation tools for estimating CO 2 fluxes. 8.2 Reporting recommendations for different C stocks Recommended CO 2 fluxes The following CO 2 fluxes should be include d in inventories: 1. CO 2 emissions from, and atmospheric removals by, organic C stocks in mineral and organic soils 2. CO 2 emissions from, and atmospheric removals by, below-ground and above-ground woody biomass (e.g., woody vegetation in or chards, vineyards and agroforestry systems) 3. CO 2 emissions from the combustion of herbaceous biomass (e.g., open burning of crop residues) 4. CO 2 emissions from DOM These fluxes should be reported within a spec ial ‘Biogenic Carbon’ category that is outside of the scopes. The one exception concerns the CO 2 emissions from soils and woody biomass that result from LUC. These LUC CO 2 emissions should be reported within the scopes because they effectively constitute permanent losses of C to the atmosphere (see Chapter 9.1). The CH 4 and N 2O emissions from all C stocks (e.g., from biomass or DOM combustion) shall always be reporte d in the scopes. Additional CO 2 fluxes that may be reported 1. Fluxes to/from inorga nic soil carbon stocks 10 This Guidance does not recommend a minimum soil depth for measuring soil C stocks. 

--- Page 62 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 62 In contrast to soil organic C stocks, inor ganic C stocks are slow to respond to management changes and often will not exhibit significant changes. Moreover, quantifying such changes requires a deta iled understanding of site hydrology and mineralogy. For instance, it may require follo wing the fate of discharged dissolved inorganic C and base cations (e.g., Ca and Mg ) from the managed land, at least until they are fully captured in the oceanic inorganic C cycle. Such analyses are highly complicated. For these reasons, companies can exclude the ne t fluxes to/from inorganic soil C stocks. However, certain management practices can be expected to significant ly affect inorganic C stocks by changing soil chemistry and i nducing the breakdown of carbonates, leading to CO 2 emissions. For instance, use of ammonium sulfate fertilizer to lower soil pH will tend to promote CO 2 emissions from inorganic C. In such cases, companies should consider quantifying the CO 2 emissions. 2. Sequestration in organic soils. In wetland environments with organic soils, the rates of C sequestration are relatively slow and can be assumed to be negligib le. They therefore can be excluded. CO 2 fluxes that should not be reported 1. Sequestration in harvested woody products (HWPs) and herbaceous vegetation The C contained in HWPs should not be include d in any reported values for the amount of sequestration in above-ground woody biomas s stocks. Depending on how these values have been calculated, this may mean that the amount of C in HWPs will have to be subtracted from estimates of the total amount of sequestration. This subtraction is necessary to ensure that i nventories do not over-estimate the net GHG benefits of woody crop production. The biomass associated with annual and pere nnial herbaceous vegetation is relatively ephemeral - reductions in these biomass stoc ks from harvesting, the burning of the crop residues, or the integration of crop residues into soils, ar e balanced by stock increases from plant re-growth over a period of only one to a few years. Consequently, companies should also not report any sequestrati on in herbaceous biomass stocks. 2. CO 2 fluxes to/from livestock The carbon incorporated into animal tissues or lost through animal respiration should not be reported in an inventory. Special note: Accounting for natural disturbances, conservation areas, and payments for environmental services Natural disturbances are varied and include fires, windstorms, landslides, droughts, and pest outbreaks. Conservation areas are lands where agricultural production has been limited or halted so as to provide environm ental benefits, such as maintaining or 

--- Page 63 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 63 improving water quality or wildlife habitat. Such areas may be established mandatorily, to meet legal requirements for resource pr otection, or voluntarily, to contribute to the public good and/or take advant age of financial incentives. Payments for Environmental Services (PESs) are incentives offered to fa rmers or landowners in exchange for managing their land to provide some sort of ecological service. Box 8-1 shows some examples of conservation areas and PESs. Natural disturbances, conservation areas, and PESs are treated identically to other sources and activities The CO 2 fluxes associated with natural distur bances, conservation ar eas and PESs should be treated the same way as other CO 2 fluxes, following the recommendations outlined above. The reason is that companies often have some measure of control over these fluxes - they are often be able to influence th e frequency or intensit y of disturbances and the corresponding amount of emissions, while operational decisions frequently lead directly to the formation of conservation areas. For instance, many forest management practices can reduce the risk of disturbances - forest thi nning can increase resilience to Box 8-1. Examples of conservation areas and PESs in agriculture Conservation easements: A legal agreement voluntarily entered into by a property owner and a qualified conservation or ganization such as a 

--- Page 64 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 64 droughts and insect/diseases outbreaks, while fuel hazard reduction and the use of prescribed fires can reduce the risk of unc ontrolled fires. Another reason for not excluding natural disturbances is that it is of ten challenging to identify whether an event actually constitutes a disturbance. For instance, there are no universally accepted criteria for defining droughts. GHG fluxes attributable to disturbances m ay also be reported in a separate line item Companies may separately estimate the amount of GHG fluxes that they consider attributable to natural distur bances and report this amount out side of the scopes in a line item that is separate from the scopes and the Biogenic Carbon category. This reporting is additional to the report ing of these same fluxes within the scopes or the Biogenic Carbon category. Estimating the specific GHG effects of individual disturbances is challenging because: 1. Ambiguity often exists around whether an event is a ‘disturbance’ or simply within the bounds of ‘normal’ envi ronmental variation. Companies might therefore have to establish criteria for consistently recognizing disturbances. 2. Natural disturbances may be rare events, in which case the effects on estimated CO 2 fluxes may be small when averaged over large areas or long periods of time and therefore difficult to accurately quan tify. For instance, the effects of a one- year period of insect defoliation might be difficult to distinguish from background fluxes over a three-year peri od. In contrast, catastrophi c disturbances such as wind storms may cause obvious and easil y estimated changes in C stocks. Because of these challenges, companies should evaluate the likely size of a disturbance before committing the resources to quantifyi ng it. For the sake of practicality, if companies do choose to report disturbance em issions, they may assume that all post- disturbance emissions occur in the year of the disturbance even t. That is, the CO 2 emissions from the long-term decay of DOM created during an event (e.g., downed trees from a windstorm) can be reported in the year of the event. Alternatively, these emissions can be amortized (see Chapter 8.3). 8.3 Amortizing changes in carbon stocks over time What is ‘amortizing’ and when is it necessary? Shifts in management practices during the reporting period will often have long-lasting effects on C stocks that may persist for d ecades. For instance, following a change in management practices (e.g., adoption of no-til l practices) soil C stocks may take 15 - 60 years to reach equilibrium, depending on the type of tillage and crop rotation regimes. Following LUC (e.g., conversion of cropland to grassland), the transition period will often exceed 100 years (e.g., Figure 8-1). Also, as Figure 8-1 demonstrates, the rate of change in C stocks will vary over time. Amortizing the CO 2 fluxes from changes in C stocks involves allocating these fluxes across time (and therefore multiple inventories) to ensure the more consistent acc ounting of C stock impacts.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 65 Figure 8-1. Illustration of land use change between grassland and cropland Source: To be provided Whether amortization is needed depends on the calculation approach As discussed in Chapter 7.3, a variety of methods can be used to quantify CO 2 fluxes. If a method is used that directly estimates the amount of GHG flux (or stock change) within the reporting period, amortizat ion is not needed. Conversely, if the estimated data are generated for the transition period as a whole, rather than just for the reporting period, amortization is needed (Table 8-1). Table 8-1. Examples of calculation approaches that will and will not require amortization of the calculated CO 2 fluxes. Calculation approach Examples Is amortization required? Directly provides an estimate of the amount of CO 2 flux or stock change that occurred in the reporting period, rather than in the transition period as a whole • A process model that estimates the cumulative net CO 2 flux over the reporting period • An emission factor that has a time dependence of only one year (e.g., tonnes C sequestered per hectare per year of practice) No Estimates the total amount of CO 2 flux or stock change over the entire transition period, under permanent adoption of the practice concerned Reference stock sizes for the amount of carbon stored in the biomass of grassland and woodland that are used to quantify the stock change associated with LUC Yes

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 66 Certain CO 2 fluxes should never be amortized Irrespective of the quantification approach, certain CO 2 fluxes should never be amortized and should always be reported in the year of the management pr actice. These are:  The CO 2 emissions from bioma ss and DOM combustion  The CO 2 emissions from the organic car bon stocks of organic soils. Amortizing the CO 2 emissions from DOM stocks is optional Some management practices ma y move C to DOM stocks that is not then emitted in the year of the intervention. For inst ance, much of the C in biomass killed in a fire is added to dead wood, litter and soil pools from where th e C will be emitted over years to decades, as the DOM decomposes. Quantifying the emissions from these DOM stock changes can be very challenging; for instance, DOM decay rates differ greatly between regions, depending on temperature and moisture regimes. Consequently, companies may either assume that the total CO 2 emissions from DOM stocks occur in the year of the intervention, or, should capacity and data ex ist, they may amortize these emissions over time. Table 8-2 summarizes when it is and is not appropriate to amortize CO 2 fluxes. Table 8-2. When CO 2 fluxes can be amortized CO 2 flux Time reporting requirement  Sequestration in woody biomass stocks  Sequestration in organic C stocks of mineral soils  Amortize if the time interval of the quantification approach exceeds one year  Otherwise, report all the estimated sequestration in the reporting period Emissions from woody biomass stocks Biomass combustion emissions should be reported in the year of the intervention Emissions from dead organic matter (DOM) From the decomposition of DOM:  Amortize, should capacity and data exist; or  Report in the year of intervention From the combustion of DOM:  Report in the year of intervention Emissions from organic C stocks of mineral soils  Amortize if the time interval of the quantification approach exceeds one year  Otherwise, report all the estimated emissions in the year of the intervention Emissions from organic soils Do not amortize – report losses as they occur Sequestration in organic soils Do not amortize - report sequestration as it occurs

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 67 How should CO 2 fluxes be amortized? Companies should amortize fluxes evenly over time When amortization is necessary, companies should use a linear-rate approach, wherein the total amount of CO 2 flux is amortized evenly over multiple inventories. This involves dividing the total flux by the number of y ears in the amortization period and then reporting the quotient in each year of the amortization period. This approach is recommended because it provides the most cons istent way to distribute impacts for use in a GHG inventory. The length of the amortization period is context specific The length of the amortization period may va ry depending on the stock concerned and the quantification approach. In general, the am ortization period for a ny one stock should be:  The length of the time dependence of the st ock change factor or emission factor; or  For woody biomass stocks, the length of the nominal harvest/ maturity cycle. The second condition assumes that woody vege tation accumulates biomass for a finite period until it is removed through harvest or re aches a steady state where there is no net accumulation of C in biomass because growth rates have slowed and incremental gains from growth are offset by losses from na tural mortality, pruning or other losses. In the absence of other information, compan ies may assume an amortization period of 20 years for DOM stocks and the organic C stocks in mineral soils. This 20-year value is the default time horizon in national GHG inve ntories submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 11. This value may be too long for certain stocks (e.g., soil stock changes in tropical biomes) and too short for others (soil stock changes in boreal biomes). Companies may alternatively assume more specific values used by individual countries in their national inventories12. Companies should account for historical LUC Companies should account for historical change s in land use that occur within a certain ‘look back’ period prior to th e base period. This look back period should be equal in length to the amortization period for the stoc k concerned (e.g., 20 years if the default IPCC amortization period for mineral soil or ganic stocks is used). Thus, if LUC happened within the 5 years pr eceding the base period, it is considered best practice to reflect it in the inventories for the base pe riod and later re porting periods, as needed. Equivalently, if the sh ift occurred more than 20 years be fore the base pe riod, it should not be reflected in the base period inventory. As discussed in Chapter 6.2, the acquisition (o r divestment) of busin ess units that own land can trigger base period recalculations. C stocks may be changing on the newly- transferred land as a result of land use ch anges introduced by the prior land-owner. 11 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories , Volume 4. 12 See http://unfccc.int/national_reports/annex_i_ghg_inventories/items/2715.php . 

--- Page 68 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 68 Therefore, when recalculating the base pe riod inventory, new landowners should assess whether these changes occurred within the re levant look back period from their base periods. If so, the associated changes in C st ocks should be included in the recalculated base year inventory. For instance, if a compa ny acquired land that had been deforested by the prior land-owner five years before the new land-owner’s base period, the associated changes in C stocks should be included in the recalculated base period inventory. Appendix II provides an example. Proxy data on historical LUC should be used in the absence of actual data Companies, and especially new landowners, may find it difficult to obtain information on historical LUC. What should they do in such cases? This Guidance recommends that companies identify and estimate historical LU C using regional or local trends in, for example, land clearance. Alte rnatively, remote sensing data may be available from commercial or public databases, although th e collection of such data can be time consuming and complicated. Additional reporting recommendations 1. To maintain the transparency of reported data, companies should report when they have not been able to collect historical data and estimate historical effects. 2. Companies should carefully document all assumptions made in amortizing CO 2 fluxes (see Chapter 9.1). This is becaus e the amortization sc hedule chosen by a company will not match actual patterns of change, and a given period’s inventory will most likely under- or over-estimate th e actual fluxes (for instance, see Fig. 8- 2). 3. If management shifts occur that would reverse any soil C sequ estration that has previously been amortized, companies should account for these losses in the inventory period in which the shift occurre d. For instance, if no till practices were to cease at any point and be replaced by c onventional till, C sequestration will be rapidly lost, and companies should record the cumulative gains up to that point as CO 2 emissions in the inventory period in which conventi onal till started. Appendix II provides simplified cas e studies that illustrate how amortization is carried out, including for historical LUC.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 69 Figure 8-2. Amortization schedules chosen by comp anies will not match actual patterns of change. In this example C sequesters in so il at a non-linear rate following the adoption of reduced-tillage. But the CO 2 emissions are amortized at a fixed rate, causing actual fluxes to be either under- or over-estimated in any one reporting period. Note that the sequestration rates rise due to reduced so il disturbance but slow down as the C stock becomes saturated due to inherent physiochemical processes.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 70 Chapter 9: Reporting GHG Data Fundamentally, a credible inve ntory provides information th at is complete, accurate, consistent and transparent, while meeting the decision-making needs of both internal management and external stakeholders. This chapter:  Describes information that must be reported in an inventory.  Outlines additional, sector-specific recommendations for reporting agricultural GHG fluxes.  Provides guidance on reporting offset a nd renewable energy projects on farms. Summary of requirements and main recommendations:  Companies shall report desc riptive information on inve ntory boundaries and base periods.  Companies shall report quantitative information on GHG fluxes following requirements in the Corporate St andard (and repeated here).  Companies should follow a set of additional ‘best practice’ recommendations for reporting agricultural GHG fluxes.  Any offset credits or renewable energy that are generated on farmland but sold off-site shall not be reflec ted in inventory totals. 9.1 Required information Companies shall publicly report the following information: General information on inventor y boundaries and base periods  The approach used to set th e organizational boundaries  An outline of the operational boundaries chos en and, if scope 3 is included, a list specifying which types of sc ope 3 activities are covered  The reporting period covered  Information on the base period, including: o The period chosen as the base period o The rationale for choosing this period o The base period recalculation policy o Base period inventory totals by cat egory (see below and Figure 9-1) o Appropriate context for any changes that trigger recalculation of the base period inventory  Any specific exclusion of sources and/ or operations from the inventory

Defining land-use change To determine when LUC has occurred and to ensure LUC impacts are accounted for consistently across inventories, companies should use a consistent set of definitions for land use categories over time. Currently, th ere is no single intern ationally accepted standard for land use classifi cation – different countries a nd international organizations have developed their own sets of definiti ons. Companies may find it simpler to use a country-specific classification system shoul d their operations occu r within a single country. Companies with agricultural operations in multiple countries may instead find it 

--- Page 73 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 73 easier to use internationally recognized classification systems (e.g., the EU’s CORINE system). A simplified set of land use categories is shown below. LUC occurs when land is converted fr om one land use category to another 13; for instance, when cropland is converted to grassland or when forests are converted to cropland. On occasion, the same area of land might be used to support multiple agricultural activities and so meet the definitions for different land-use categories. For instance, savannah woodland might be used both to graze livesto ck and as a source of wood fuel. In such cases, companies should categorize the land based on the agricultural activity that is economically most important . Land use category Definition Forest land An area of high concentra tion of woody biomass. Typically defined on the basis of a minimum tree height and canopy cover. Forests lands include plantations, primary fo rests, and naturally regenerated forests with evidence of human intervention Cropland Includes rice fields and agro-forestry systems. Grassland Managed grasslands , rangelands, pasture land. Wetland Areas of peat extraction and land that is covered or saturated by water for all or part of the year (e.g., pe atlands) and that does not fall into other categories. Settlements All developed land (e.g., roads, buildings, etc.). 9.3 Additional information that may be reported Besides the required and best practice reporting elements, companies may wish to report other information to enhance the transparency and relevance of thei r inventories. This information includes:  Data on the size of C stocks (in metric tonnes C per unit land area)  Biogenic CO 2 flux data further subdivided by th e type of C stock (e.g., DOM versus biomass stocks)  Other GHG flux data further subdivided by the type of non-mechanical source (e.g., enteric fermentation versus manure management) 13 This Guidance follows the ‘land-based’ approach for recognizing LUC, as opposed to an ‘activities- based’ approach. Land-based approaches assess the net emissions of select land-use categories while activity-based approaches as sess the net emissions of select land-use activities. Both approaches can be used for developing national GHG inventories for the UNFCCC.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 74  Emissions of other GHGs (e.g., those of CFCs)  Performance metrics and a description of any allocation approach used in deriving these (see Appendix I)  A description of performance measured ag ainst internal or external benchmarks  An outline of current management practi ces and any GHG management strategies  GHG flux data for relevant scope 3 sources for which reliable da ta can be obtained  Information on the uncertainty of GHG flux data The reporting of scope 3 sources is optional, but encouraged Scope 3 sources are many and diverse. The Sc ope 3 Standard identifies 15 distinct categories. These include the activities of the reporting company’s direct suppliers, cradle-to-gate impacts further upstream, as well as downstream activities, such as the customer use and disposal of products the company has manufactured and sold. Which scope 3 sources should be included in an inventory? Companies may either: 1. Report scope 3 emissions in accordance with the Corporate Standard (i.e. scope 3 sources are optional) 2. Report scope 3 emissions in accordance with the Scope 3 Standard For many companies, scope 3 emissions will represent a significant component of overall GHG impacts. For instance, the manufacture of fertilizer and livestock feed will be important scope 3 sources for crop and lives tock operations, respectively. Moreover, companies may undertake some actions that reduce their scope 1 and 2 emissions, but that then increase their scope 3 emissions (e.g., the outsourcing of feed production). For these reasons, specific scope 3 sources s hould be reported where those sources are considered significant. Criteria for as sessing significance can include amounts of emissions, emissions reduction potential, contri bution to risk exposur e (e.g., regulatory or reputational risks), and importance to stakeh olders. In general, the scope 3 emissions from fertilizer and feed production should be included in inventories, where possible. 9.4 Agricultural offset and renewable energy projects Companies can generate renewabl e energy in many ways, including:  Developing their own wind turbines or leasing land to wind power development firms  Growing trees, short rotation woodland a nd short rotation coppi ce as a source of biomass fuel stock  Installing anaerobic digesters to produce methane as fuel for electricity or heat  Developing farm-scale micro hydroelectricity schemes (typically less than ~ 100kW)  Using solar panels Such projects are a potential s ource of offset credits. Other offset projects could be based on the reforestation or rest oration of degraded lands and changes in fertilizer management.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 75 Accounting for renewable energy projects The impact of many of these projects on a company’s inventory will depend on whether any of the energy that is generated is cons umed on-site by the company or sent to the grid. If the energy is consumed on-site, the project may reduce the amount of electricity or fuel consumed, resulting in a reduction in scope 1 or sc ope 2 emissions that will be evident when comparing inventories over time . On the other hand, if the energy is sent off-site, it shall not be used to lower scope 1 or scope 2 em issions. This is necessary to prevent double counting of the emissions be nefits of that energy. This requirement extends to the calculation of performance metrics, which should not include the emissions benefits of sold energy. The GHG Protocol Guidelines for Grid-Connected Electricity Projects – a supplement to the Project Pr otocol (Chapter 1.2) - provide guidance on quantifying the emission s reductions from sold energy. Accounting for ‘avoided’ emissions Many renewable energy projects may have GHG impacts that extend beyond the farm gate – they may help to di splace (or ‘avoid’) the emissi ons from fossil fuel-based electricity generation elsewhere on the grid that would have occurred in the absence of the project. Importantly, renewa ble energy generation projects do not always result in a physical reduction in emissions from fossil fuel consumption. For example:  On-site renewable energy that is sold to th e grid: the total emissions of a fossil-fuel plant are affected by the aggregate demand of all consumers connected to the grid, such that the sale of renewable energy may be balanced by an increased demand for electricity amongst other grid consumers, w ith no net change in absolute emissions from the fossil-fuel plant.  Switching from residual fuel to wood wast e produced on a farm: such switching may lead to emissions reductions from crude oil refining and waste fuel disposal, but whether these reductions are actually realized depends on the demand for fuel oil by other organizations. In these cases, the behavior of other consumer s – which is outside of the control of the reporting company – means avoided emissions do not necessarily occur. As a result, avoided emissions shall not be reported within the scopes and they shall not be used to ‘net’ emissions14. However, estimates of avoided emissions may be reported as a memo item, as long as the underlying assumptions and appropriate cal culation methodologies are also described. The Project Protocol pr ovides guidance releva nt for calculating avoided emissions. Accounting for transactions in offset credits Should a company sell an offset that has been generated within its organizational boundaries, it shall remove the associated emissions reduc tions from its corporate inventory to prevent double count ing. It should also disclose the protocol used to verify the emissions reductions. 14 Avoided emissions are also not quantified as part of product life cycle inventories under the GHG Protocol Product Standard.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 77 Appendix I: Performance metrics The Corporate Standard and this Guidance only require the reporting of absolute GHG flux data. GHG performance metrics do not have to be reported. However, they can provide important insights into a company’s GHG performance and are generally recommended as part of an effective GHG reporting and management system. For instance, they can be used to:  Evaluate performance over time (e.g., compare figures from different years, identify trends in data, and show performance in relation to targets and base periods).  Improve comparability between different sizes of operations by normalizing figures (e.g., by assessing the impact of differently sized operations on the same scale). This Appendix:  Summarizes the various types of GH G performance metrics that exist.  Provides general recommendations for the calcula tion, use, and reporting of metrics. Types and usage of performance metrics Many types of performance metrics exist Some examples of performance metrics are: Productivity and efficiency rati os: These express the value or achievement of a company divided by its GHG impact. Increasing effici ency ratios therefore reflect a positive performance improvement. Examples of producti vity/efficiency ratios include resource productivity ratios (e.g., sales per GHG) and process eco-efficiency ratios (e.g., production volume per amount of GHG). Intensity ratios: Intensity (or ‘normalized ’) ratios express GHG impact per unit of physical activity or unit of economic output. A physical intensity ratio is suitable when aggregating or comparing across businesses that have similar products. In turn, an economic intensity ratio is suitable when a ggregating or comparing across businesses that produce different products. A declining intens ity ratio reflects a positive performance improvement. Examples of intensity ratio s include product inte nsity (e.g., tonnes of emissions per unit of sold livestock or crops generated) and sales intensity (e.g., emissions per sales). When calculating intensity ratios companies may have to allocate GHG fluxes amongst different product streams (see below). Percentages: A percentage indicator is a ra tio between two similar variables (with the same physical unit in the numerator and the de nominator). Examples of percentages that can be meaningful in performance reports include current GHG fluxes expressed as a percentage of base year GHG fluxes. In selecting a performance metric, companies should consider which metrics best capture the benefits and impacts of their business (e .g., its operations, its produ cts, and its effects on the marketplace), as well as its intended application.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 78 The use of multiple performa nce metrics is recommended Companies might find it useful to track perfor mance using more than one metric. This is because individual metrics might exclude certai n sources, such as those associated with by-products or co-products (see below) or those not directly connected to the production system. For the same reason, performance me trics should always be reported alongside data on the absolute GHG fluxes to/from a farm. The following scenarios show the importance of using additional ratio indica tors (in addition to reporting absolute GHG flux data) to track performan ce at the whole farm level:  Production intensification (e.g., an increased use of fertilizers and/or feed) might boost yields and result in a ne t reduction in GHG intensity per unit of agricultural output (provided the inputs are not excessive ), but could also increase emissions on a per hectare basis.  Increasing the feed conversion efficiency of cattle can reduce emissions per product, but can lead to greater overall emissions (a nd emissions per ha) if any spare feed is diverted to new livestock. Table I-1 describes various trade-offs asso ciated with different types of metrics commonly used in the agricultural sector. Contextual information should be provided Importantly, the inherent divers ity of agricultural practices, as well as the influence of environmental factors on GHG fluxes, will aff ect the comparability of metrics, both within and across businesses. For example:  Intensity ratios will often be higher for self-replacing livestock herds than non- replacement herds. This is because self -replacing herds contain younger stock that emit enteric CH 4 and produce N 2O from urine depositions for a longer period of time before contributing to farm products.  Adverse weather conditions can lower re alized crop yields, causing inter-annual variation in intensity ratios , independent of any changes in farming practices. (Note: in such cases, companies may find it usef ul to normalize and report emissions by expected yield, in addition to actual yield). Without adequate context on the farming system, environmental effects, and the emissions sources that have been studie d, performance metrics are not useful for assessing performance. Such context should be provided in reports to aid the reliable interpretation of performance metrics.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 79 Table I-1. Advantages and disadvantages of common performance metrics Metric Advantages Disadvantages GHG flux per unit land area (e.g., flux / ha)  Useful to companies that define policies or that manage large amounts of land (e.g., government agencies)  Reflective of the overall level of GHG fluxes on farms  Fails to consider efficiency of farm production GHG flux per unit product (e.g., flux / tonne beef)  Better allows for comparisons within the same industry  Better able to represent the effects of mitigation measures that have a relatively small GHG impact, but that nonetheless improve productivity  Performance data are frequently sought by buyers on a per-product basis  Calculation may be complicated by the variety of products that come from farms and the different allocation methods used to assign GHG fluxes (see below)  Does not consider product value  Does not reflect the overall climate impact of farms (which would vary depending on the volume of products produced) GHG flux per unit of farm input (e.g., flux / MJ metabolisable energy intake)  Provides an understanding of the effects of feed type and amount on animal systems, or of the efficiency of nutrient use in cropping systems  Calculation may be complicated by the need to allocate GHG fluxes GHG flux per unit of quality content in final product (e.g., per unit of fat, protein or metabolisable energy content)  Considers a fundamental objective of most agricultural production – to provide food energy  Calculation may be complicated by the need to allocate GHG fluxes Allocating GHG data for cal culating performance metrics Agricultural production frequently results in the generation of by-products or co-products, especially if farms have on-site product processing facilities. In additi on, certain agricultural activities will contribute to multiple streams of products (and their co/by-products), especially on mixed farms (Figure I-1). For instance, fertiliz er application will support not only crop growth, but also livestock production, if so me of the primary output (the cr op) is used as livestock feed. Allocation is the process of partit ioning GHG flux data from a fa rm to the different product streams from that farm. Allocation may be needed when computing intensity ratios for individual products. Allocation may also be needed when: ‐ Reporting GHG data to customers that are acc ounting for their scope 3 emissions and that therefore only require information on the specific GHG fluxe s attributable to the products they purchased. 

--- Page 80 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 80 ‐ Allocating GHG fluxes between scope 1 and scope 3. Allocations will not be necessary wh en a farm produces only one output. They should not be done to calculate the GHG fluxes that a re to be reported in a corporate inventory , except to allocate between scope 1 and scope 3. Also, this Guidance is not concerned with allocations for product-level GHG accounting – for guidance on th is topic, see the GHG Protocol Product Standard, sectoral life cycl e accounting guidance, or produc t category rules. Should allocations be performed, note that co-p roducts without economic value are considered wastes and should have no GHG fl uxes allocated to them. Also, if GHG fluxes are allocated, they should sum to the total flux initially calculated. Figure I-1. Illustration of a common process requiring allocation Allocation should be avoided where possible If possible, companies should avoid allocati on because allocation adds uncertainty to performance metrics. Companies may be able to avoid allocation in a number of ways:  By dividing the common GHG emitti ng process into sub-processe s that separately produce the various products. This approach may be accomplished by subdividing the farm and providing data on the quantities of inputs going to each farm enterprise. Mechanical sources will often be the most difficult to allocate because farm records are often on a whole-farm basis. One possible solution may be to se t up energy use accounting on a per product basis by, for example, sub-metering individual faciliti es and tracking fuel consumption or the number of field passe s by field and date.  By redefining the scope of analysis for the perf ormance metric so that the fluxes attributable to the various products no longer have to be separated. For instance, by expressing GHG emissions on a kg sheep-raised basis as opposed to a kg lamb meat basis, it is no longer necessary to separate out the emissi ons attributable to wool production. Different allocation approaches exist Should allocation be unavoidable, th e following approaches may be used: 

--- Page 81 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 81 Physical allocation: Allocations are based on an underlying phys ical relationship between the multiple inputs/outputs and the GHG fluxes. For example, if mass is the main causal factor driving differences between products, allocations can be based on the mass of farm outputs: Allocated flux ൌ ൬Mass of specific product produced Total mass of all products produced൰ x Total flux Alternatively, physical allocations could be made based on the num ber or dietary quality of the products. The factor chosen should most accurate ly reflect the underlying physical relationship between the products and GHG fluxes. For example, if the mass of the outputs determines the amount of flux, choosing an energy content fact or would not provide the most accurate allocation. Economic allocation: Allocations are based on the market value of each product leaving the process, as follows: Allocated flux ൌ ൬Market Value of specific product produced Total market value of all products produced൰ x Total flux The market value of co-product(s) should be th e value of the co-products as they leave the common process (i.e. prior to any further proces sing). Also, if prices for the outputs vary over the reporting period, it may be necessary to develop averages for the market values of the outputs over this period. Under either physical or economic allocati on, co-products without economic value are considered wastes and should have no GHG fluxes allocated to them. Selecting an allocation approach A single approach should be used to consistently allocate the GHG data for all of the products of a farm. Otherwise, the use of multiple alloca tion methods might result in the over- or under- counting of total farm-wide fluxes. Different allocation methods can yield significantly different resu lts. For example, in cheese manufacturing, cheese is consid ered the main product, while whey powder, whey butter and grated cheese are considered co-products. U nder an economic allocation approach, the higher value of cheese compared with the co-produc ts results in most of the GHG fluxes being attributed to the cheese. In contrast, under a phys ical allocation approach, the greater mass of the co-products would result in most of the GHG fl uxes being attributed to the co-products. Companies should select the allocation approach that:  Best reflects the causal relationship between the production of the outputs and the resulting GHG fluxes;  Results in the most accurate and credible flux estimates; 

--- Page 82 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 82  Best supports effective decision-ma king and GHG reduction activities; and  Otherwise adheres to the principles of rele vance, accuracy, completeness, consistency and transparency. Broadly, physical allocation is preferred when:  A physical relationship amongst th e products can be established and this relationship drives their relative GHG impacts.  Prices change significantly or frequently ove r time. Example: fluctuation in commodity crop prices (note: averaging prices over three to five years can help avoid this problem).  Prices are not well-correlate d with underlying physical pr operties and GHG fluxes.  Companies pay different prices for the same pr oduct (due to different negotiated prices). Economic allocation is preferred when:  A physical relationship amongst th e products cannot be establis hed or does not adequately reflect their GHG impacts.  The co-products were a waste output that acquire s value in the market place as a replacement for another material input (e.g., manur e as a replacement for fertilizer).

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 83 Appendix II: Amortizing CO 2 Fluxes to / from Carbon Stocks Introduction Shifts in the management of farmland or the conversion of one land-us e category into another can change C stocks over long time periods. Chapter 8 describes methodologies for accounting for the associated CO 2 fluxes. Depending on how these fluxes have been calculated, they may have to be amortized over a defined time period, with an equal amount of flux allocated to each year over that period. Consistent with Inte rgovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodologies, the length of this period can be assumed to be 20 years, unless more specific information is available (see Chapter 8.3). The amortization approach is illustrated here us ing a common land use pattern in central Brazil - the conversion of native vegetati on (cerrado) into pasture and s ubsequently into an annual crop rotation (soybean-corn). Two cases are presented:  Case A: All soil stock changes are amortized before any further changes occur in the ownership or management of stocks  Case B:  Case C: Purchase of land undergoing changes in C stocks While these cases are hypothetical, they use repres entative data on soil C st ocks that are derived from published studies. To facilit ate ease of understanding, only soil C stocks are considered, while all fluxes are amortized before any furt her shifts occur in ma nagement practices. The management practices and land-use types consid ered, along with the corresponding C stocks, are shown in Table II-1. Table II-1. Soil C stocks of different manage ment practices and land use types. 

--- Page 84 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 84 Case A: All soil stock changes are amorti zed before any further changes occur in the ownership or management of stocks Cerrado is converted into a no-till crop system over the course of 75 years. While multiple shifts in land use and farming practices occu r over this period, the resulting CO 2 fluxes are fully amortized before any further shifts occur. Table II-2 describes the ti me series of shifts in land use and management practices, as well as how the corresponding CO 2 fluxes are amortized. GHG emissions inventories are prepared annually. Figu re II-1 shows how the C stocks change over time with amortization. Table II-2. The amortization schedule for case A Figure II-1: Changes in C stocks are fully amortized before any further shifts in management practices or management occur (Case A) 

--- Page 85 of 103 ---

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 85 Case B: Not all soil stock changes are amortized be fore a further change occurs in stock management Same as Case A, except that the pasture is converted into a full-till crop system only 10 years after the cerrado was first converted into pastur e (i.e., when only half of the change in carbon stocks has been amortized). Table II-3 describe s the time series of shifts in land use and management practices, as well as how the en suing changes in carbon stocks are amortized.

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 86 Table II-3. The amortization schedule for case B. Case C: Purchase of land unde rgoing changes in C stocks Same as Case A, but the land is acquired by the reporting company (a t year 28) after its conversion into pasture (Figure II-2). The reporting company amortizes the CO 2 fluxes from this conversion over a 20 year period (ending year 25), but does not include all of these fluxes in its inventories. Instead, it only revises its inventories to report the CO 2 fluxes that occurred during years 20–25. This is because year 20 was established as its base pe riod. Table II-4 describes how the changes in C stocks are amor tized by the reporting company. Figure II-2. The reporting company purchases land that is undergoing changes in C stocks because of a shift in land use made by a prior owner (Case C)

GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance 88 Appendix III: Tools for calculating agricultural GHG fluxes Overview This Appendix lists some of the most widely used tools (spreadsheets, so ftware and protocols) for calculating GHG fluxes in agriculture. Thr ee broad classes of tools are covered:  Tools suitable for farm managers. These are ge nerally web- or Excel-based calculators that can be used with commonly available types of activity data. They tend to implement a variety of the calculation appr oaches described in Table 7- 1; namely, emission factors, empirical or process models, or some combination of these approaches.  General catalogues of calculation methodologi es. These describe formulae and default emission factors that can be used to calculate flux data for an extens ive range of emissions sources. They do not provide an interface for performing calculations.  Tools suitable for academic use. These are primarily process-based models intended for academic research. They have extensive requirements in terms of data inputs, labor and expertise, and would not be recommended fo r use by farm managers. They are described here because they underpin many of the more accessible resources. Table III-1 lists the GHGs and operations covered by each tool , while Table III-2 provides further information on each tool, such as its geographic focus and type of interface. Notes and Caveats  These tools typically generate GHG flux data in a format that is not automatically in conformance with this Guidance. Users will of ten therefore need to reformat these data (e.g., to divide them by scopes) for the purpos e of developing a cor porate GHG inventory.  This Appendix does not attempt to provide an exhaustive list of t ools, but is merely intended as an illustrative gui de. The tools listed here may change over time and companies are encouraged to check the corresponding websites for updated information.  Many different combinations of environmental and management factors will affect agricultural GHG fluxes. For exampl e, even if a tool is rele vant to, say, ‘cropland’ or ‘livestock’ operations, as indicated in Table III-1, it may not cover the specific combinations of interest.  The tools’ coverage of specialty crops and more complex livestock systems is less comprehensive than that for commodity crops and relatively simple livestock systems.  The tools may employ different definitions fo r the same management practices and land use categories. Companies should ensure that co nsistent definitions are applied when using multiple tools for a single inventory.  This Appendix focuses on non-mechanical sour ces, although many of the tools listed will also cover mechanical sources, mostly fuel use and fertilizer production.  Tools for product-, project- and natio nal-level assessments are excluded.
