(c) the management system in place shows compliance with the forest sustainability criteria as defined in
Article 29(6) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, and as of the date of its application with the implementing
act on operational guidance for energy from forest biomass adopted under Article 29(8) of that Directive.
1.5. The activity does not involve the degradation of land with high carbon stock (  58 ). 
1.6. The management system associated with the activity in place complies with the due diligence obligation
and legality requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 995/2010.
1.7. The forest management plan or equivalent instrument provides for monitoring which ensures the
correctness of the information contained in the plan, in particular as regards the data relating to the involved area.
2. Climate benefit analysis  
2.1. For areas that comply with the requirements at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and
sinks levels in the forest are maintained or strengthened over the long term in accordance with Article 29(7),
point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 the activity complies with the following criteria:
(a) the climate benefit analysis demonstrates that the net balance of GHG emissions and removals generated by
the activity over a period of 30 years after the beginning of the activity is lower than a baseline,
corresponding to the balance of GHG emissions and removals over a period of 30 years starting at the
beginning of the activity, associated to the business-as-usual practices that would have occurred on the
involved area in the absence of the activity;
(b) long-term climate benefits are considered demonstrated by proof of alignment with Article 29(7), point (b),
of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.
2.2. For areas that do not comply with the requirements at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon
stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained or strengthened over the long term in accordance with
Article 29(7), point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 the activity complies with the following criteria:
(a) the climate benefit analysis demonstrates that the net balance of GHG emissions and removals generated by
the activity over a period of 30 years after the beginning of the activity is lower than a baseline,
corresponding to the balance of GHG emissions and removals over a period of 30 years starting at the
beginning of the activity, associated to the business-as-usual practices that would have occurred on the
involved area in the absence of the activity.
(b) the projected long-term average net GHG balance of the activity is lower than the long-term average GHG
balance projected for the baseline, referred to in point 2.2, where long term corresponds to the longer
duration between 100 years and the duration of an entire forest cycle.
2.3. The calculation of climate benefit complies with all of the following criteria:
(a) the analysis is consistent with the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse
Gas Inventories (  59 ). The climate benefit analysis is based on transparent, accurate, consistent, complete and 
comparable information, covers all carbon pools impacted by the activity, including above-ground biomass,
below-ground biomass, deadwood, litter and soil, relies on the most conservative assumptions for calculations
and includes appropriate considerations about the risks of non-permanence and reversals of carbon seques Â­
tration, the risk of saturation and the risk of leakage.
(b) the business as-usual practices, including harvesting practices, are one of the following:
(i) the management practices as documented in the latest version of the forest management plan or
equivalent instrument before the start of the activity, if any;
(ii) the most recent business-as-usual practices prior to the start of the activity;
(iii) the practices corresponding to a management system ensuring that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the
forest area are maintained or strengthened over th e long term as set out in Article 29(7), point (b), of
