removal rate per mass or volume of product. However,
the most typical form of atmospheric CO2 removal is due
to biogenic uptake during photosynthesis. In this case,
companies usually only know the amount of biogenic
carbon contained in the material or product. To convert
this to CO2, the amount of carbon is multiplied by the
ratio of molecular weights of CO2 (44) and carbon (12),
respectively. CO2 removal data, like direct emissions data,
does not need to be multiplied by an emission factor and
can simply be multiplied by the GWP of 1 for CO2.
kg CO2e  =   kg Biogenic Carbon  x  (44/12)  x  GWP  
                    [kg CO2e/kg GHG]
Alternatively, companies may want to sum all emissions
and removals per GHG per unit of analysis before applying
the GWP. This approach is recommended if companies
wish to have the option of reporting results separately by
GHG or using a different GWP value.
Companies should be cognizant of significant figures and
rounding rules when calculating emissions and removals,
particularly when using emissions factors from a life
cycle database or software program that automatically
calculates emissions when activity data are given as an
input. The number of significant figures of the emission
data should not exceed that of the activity data or
emission factor with the least significant figures used in
the calculation.
