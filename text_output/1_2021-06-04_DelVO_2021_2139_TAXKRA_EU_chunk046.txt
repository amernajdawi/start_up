(i) assessment of forest related risks, including forest fires, and pests and diseases outbreaks, with the aim of
preventing, reducing and controlling the risks and measures deployed to ensure protection and adaptation
against residual risks;
(j) assessment of impact on food security;
(k) all DNSH criteria relevant to afforestation.
1.3. When the area becomes a forest, the afforestation plan is followed by a subsequent forest management
plan or an equivalent instrument, as set out in national law or, where national law does not define a forest
management plan or equivalent instrument, as referred to in the FAO definition of ‘forest area with long-term
forest management plan’ (  4 ). The forest management plan or the equivalent instrument covers a period of 
10 years or more and is continuously updated.
1.4. Information is provided on the following points that are not already documented in the forest
management plan or equivalent system:
(a) management goals, including major constraints (  5 ); 
(b) general strategies and activities planned to reach the management goals, including expected operations over
the whole forest cycle;
(c) definition of the forest habitat context, including main existing and intended forest tree species, and their
extent and distribution;
(d) definition of the area according to its gazetting in the land registry;
(e) compartments, roads, rights of way and other public access, physical features including waterways, areas
under legal and other restrictions;
(f) measures deployed to maintain the good condition of forest ecosystems;
(g) consideration of societal issues (including preservation of landscape, consultation of stakeholders in
accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in national law);
(h) assessment of forest related risks, including forest fires, and pests and diseases outbreaks, with the aim of
preventing, reducing and controlling the risks and measures deployed to ensure protection and adaptation
against residual risks;
(i) all DNSH criteria relevant to forest management.
1.5. The activity follows the best afforestation practices laid down in national law, or, where no such best
afforestation practices have been laid down in national law, the activity complies with one of the following
criteria:
(a) the activity complies with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 807/2014 (  6 ); 
(b) the activity follows the “Pan-European Guidelines for Afforestation and Reforestation with a special focus on
the provisions of the UNFCCC” (  7 ). 
1.6. The activity does not involve the degradation of land with high carbon stock (  8 ).
