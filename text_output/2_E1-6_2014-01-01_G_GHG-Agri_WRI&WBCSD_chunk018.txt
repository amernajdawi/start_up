 Table 2-2.  Some agricultural practices that can reduce GHG emissions and improve farm performance*  
Practice  Potential GHG benefits  Potential environmental 
co-benefits Potential agronomic /
business benefits  Potential trade-offs or 
problems
Cover crops
Non-commodity crops
planted in between rows
of commodity crops or
during fallow periods   Increased soil C 
sequestration
 Reduced indirect N 2O
emissions from soils due to
a reduction in N leaching  
 Reduced scope 3
emissions from fertilizer manufacture  Improved soil nutrient
content  
 Reduced wind and
water erosion
 Reduced nutrient and
sediment run off and
leaching  Reduced fertilizer needs
 Reduced weed growth
 Reduced irrigation needs
 Supplemental livestock
feed (extends grazing season, cattle weight
gain)
 Increased profit  Requires extra time
and knowledge to manage, and some new techniques for
growing commodity
crops
 Requires more fuel
use for crop planting
Conservation tillage
A range of cultivation
techniques (including minimum till, strip till, no-till) designed to minimize soil disturbance
for seed placement, by
allowing crop residue to remain on soil after planting  Increased soil C
sequestration
 Reduced indirect N
2O
emissions from reduction in run-off
 Reduced scope 3
emissions from fertilizer manufacture
 Improved soil water
retention and drainage
 Reduced water and
wind erosion
 Reduced nutrient and
sediment runoff  Reduced fertilizer needs
 Reduced fuel and labor
costs from fewer field
passes
 Improved yields
 Retains top soil  Potential increase in
herbicide use
 Increased pest threats
in repetitive single commodity production
Rotational or mob livestock grazing on pasture
Grazing practices that maximize plant health
and diversity, while increasing the animal carrying capacity of the land  Increased soil C
sequestration
 Reduced CH
4 emissions
from enteric fermentation (due to improved feed)
 Increased plant cover
and productivity
 Improved soil water
retention and drainage
 Reduced water and
wind erosion
 Reduced nutrient and
sediment runoff
 Increased herd size
 Can increase length of
grazing season
 Reduced need for
purchases of feed
 Pastures more able to
exclude weeds / exotic
species
 Potentially reduced
herbicide costs
 Helps avoid burning  Requires careful
management in some areas with sensitive species
 Labor intensive

fields as a management
practice
Anaerobic digester
Enclosed system in which
organic material such as manure is broken down by microorganisms under
anaerobic conditions  Reduced N
2O and CH 4
emissions from manure management  
 Reduced scope 3
emissions from fertilizer manufacture  Reduced risk of
accidental toxic leakages (pathogens killed)
 Reduced ammonia and
VOC emissions  Processed solids can be
used as bedding
 Reduced need for
fertilizers (as nutrient availability in the digestate is increased)
 Electricity / heat
generation  Digester
technologies can be expensive
Windbreaks
Plantations usually made
up of one or more rows of trees or shrubs   Increased C sequestration 
in biomass and soils  Reduced soil erosion  Greater animal survival
and health in livestock
systems  May take some land
out of production
Switch from constantly flooded to intermittently flooded rice fields   Reductions in CH
4
emissions (as oxygen is allowed to reach soil)  Reduced water use and
increased use of rainfall
 Less fuel used in
irrigation  
*, A more extensive discussion of the advantages and disadvanta ges of different management practices can be found in Stockwell & Bitan (2011)

 Chapter 3: Principles  
As with financial accounting and repo rting principles, generally accepted GHG
accounting principles are intended  to ensure that an inventor y represents a faithful, true, 
and fair account of a company’s GHG fluxes.  This chapter: 
 Introduces  GHG accounting and reporting principles  as they apply to farms, 
businesses and others in the agriculture sector.
