ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 81/28446. When disclosing the information on GHG emissions required under paragraph 44, the undertaking shall refer to
ESRS 1 paragraphs from 62 to 67. In principle, the data on GHG emissions of its associates or joint ventures that are
part of the undertaking’s upstream and downstream value chain (ESRS 1 Paragraph 67) are not limited to the share of
equity held. For its associates, joint ventures, unconsolidated subsidiaries (investment entities) and contractual
arrangements that are joint arrangements not structured through an entity (i.e., jointly controlled operations and
assets), the undertaking shall include the GHG emissions in accordance with the extent of the undertaking’s
operational control over them.
47. In case of significant changes in the definition of what constitutes the reporting undertaking and its upstream and
downstream value chain
, the undertaking shall disclose these changes and explain their effect on the year-to-year
comparability of its reported GHG emissions (i.e., the effect on the comparability of current versus previous
reporting period GHG emissions).
48. The disclosure on gross Scope 1 GHG emissions required by paragraph 44 (a) shall include:
(a) the gross Scope 1 GHG emissions in metric tonnes of CO2eq; and
(b) the percentage of Scope 1 GHG emissions from regulated emission trading schemes.
49. The disclosure on gross Scope 2 GHG emissions required by paragraph 44 (b) shall include:
(a) the gross location-based Scope 2 GHG emissions in metric tonnes of CO2eq; and
(b) the gross market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions in metric tonnes of CO2eq.
50. For Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosed as required by paragraphs 44 (a) and (b) the undertaking shall
disaggregate the information, separately disclosing emissions from:
(a) the consolidated accounting group (the parent and subsidiaries); and
(b) investees such as associates, joint ventures, or unconsolidated subsidiaries that are not fully consolidated in the
financial statements of the consolidated accounting group, as well as contractual arrangements that are joint
arrangements not structured through an entity (i.e., jointly controlled operations and assets), for which it has
operational control.
51. The disclosure of gross Scope 3 GHG emissions required by paragraph 44 (c) shall include GHG emissions in metric
tonnes of CO2eq from each significant Scope 3 category (i.e. each Scope 3 category that is a priority for the
undertaking) .
52. The disclosure of total GHG emissions required by paragraph 44 (d) shall be the sum of Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG
emissions required by paragraphs 44 (a) to (c). The total GHG emissions shall be disclosed with a disaggregation that
makes a distinction of:
(a) the total GHG emissions derived from the underlying Scope 2 GHG emissions being measured using the
location-based method; and
(b) the total GHG emissions derived from the underlying Scope 2 GHG emissions being measured using the market- based method.
GHG Intensity based on net revenue (
39)
53. The undertaking shall disclose its GHG emissions intensity (total GHG emissions per net revenue).
(39)This information supports the information needs of financial market participants subject to Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 because it is
derived from a mandatory indicator related to principal adverse impacts as set out by indicator #3 in Table I of Annex I of
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 with regard to disclosure rules on sustainable investments (“GHG intensity of
investee companies”). This information is aligned with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 (Climate Benchmark
Regulation), Article 8 (1).OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
