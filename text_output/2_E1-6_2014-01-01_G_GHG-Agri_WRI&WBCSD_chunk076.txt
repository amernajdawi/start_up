may be too long for certain stocks ( e . g . , soil stock changes in tropical biomes ) and too short for others ( soil stock changes in boreal biomes ) . Companies may alternatively assume more specific values used by individual countries in their national inventories12 .

Companies  should account for historical LUC  
Companies should account for historical change s in land use that occur within a certain
‘look back’ period prior to th e base period. This look back  period should be equal in 
length to the amortization period for the stoc k concerned (e.g., 20 years if the default
IPCC amortization period for mineral soil or ganic stocks is used). Thus, if LUC
happened within the 5 years pr eceding the base period, it is considered best practice to
reflect it in the inventories for the base pe riod and later re porting periods, as needed.
Equivalently, if the sh ift occurred more than 20 years be fore the base pe riod, it should not
be reflected in the base period inventory.   As discussed in Chapter 6.2, the acquisition (o r divestment) of busin ess units that own 
land can trigger base period recalculations. C stocks may be changing on the newly-
transferred land as a result of land use ch anges introduced by the prior land-owner.
