ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 1/164COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2023/2486 of 27 June 2023 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, to the transition to a circular economy, to pollution prevention and control, or to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems and for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives and amending Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 as regards specific public disclosures for those economic activities (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (1), and in particular Articles 8(4), 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) and 15(2) thereof, Whereas: (1) Regulation (EU) 2020/852 establishes the general framework for determining whether an economic activity qualifies as environmentally sustainable for the purposes of establishing the degree to which an investment is environmentally sustainable. That Regulation applies to measures adopted by the Union or by Member States that set out requirements for financial market participants or issuers in respect of financial products or corporate bonds that are made available as environmentally sustainable, to financial market participants that make available financial products, and to undertakings that are subject to the obligation to publish a non-financial statement pursuant to Article 19a of Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (2)or a consolidated non- financial statement pursuant to Article 29a of that Directive. Economic operators or public authorities that are not covered by Regulation (EU) 2020/852 may also apply that Regulation on a voluntary basis. (2) Articles 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) and 15(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 require the Commission to adopt delegated acts establishing the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which a specific economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, to the transition to a circular economy, to pollution prevention and control or to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, respectively, and to establish, for each relevant environmental objective laid down in Article 9 of that Regulation, technical screening criteria for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to one or more of those environmental objectives. (3) The Communication from the Commission of 6 July 2021 ‘Strategy for Financing the Transition to a Sustainable Economy’ ( 3)announced the establishment of technical screening criteria for environmental objectives covering the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, to the transition to a circular economy, to pollution (1)OJ L 198, 22.6.2020, p. 13. (2)Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19).

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 2/164prevention and control, and to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. Those technical screening criteria should be adopted in addition to the technical screening criteria established in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 (4). (4) The technical screening criteria for environmental objectives covering the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, should, like the technical screening criteria established in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139, where possible, follow the classification of economic activities laid down in the NACE Revision 2 classification system of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 5). To facilitate the identification by undertakings and financial market participants of the relevant economic activities for which technical screening criteria should be established, the specific description of an economic activity should also include indicative references to NACE codes that can be associated with that activity. Those references should be understood as indicative and should not prevail over the specific definition of the economic activity provided in its description. (5) The technical screening criteria for economic activities that contribute substantially to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, to the transition to a circular economy, to pollution prevention and control, and to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems should ensure that the economic activity concerned has a positive impact on one of those objectives. Those technical screening criteria should therefore refer to thresholds or performance levels that the economic activity should achieve to qualify as contributing substantially to one of those objectives. The technical screening criteria for ‘do no significant harm’ (DNSH) should ensure that the economic activity has no significant negative environmental impacts, including climate-related impacts. Consequently, those technical screening criteria should specify the minimum requirements that the economic activity should meet to qualify as environmentally sustainable. (6) The technical screening criteria for determining whether an economic activity contributes substantially to one of the environmental objectives laid down in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and does no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives should, where relevant build, on existing Union law, best practices, standards and methodologies, and well-established standards, practices and methodologies developed by internationally reputed public entities. Where those standards, practices and methodologies are not available for a specific policy area, the technical screening criteria should build on well-established standards developed by internationally reputed private bodies. (7) Pursuant to Article 19(1), point (h), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, the technical screening criteria should take into account the nature and the scale of the economic activity and sector that they refer to, and whether the economic activity is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 16 of that Regulation. For the technical screening criteria to meet the requirements of Article 19 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 in an effective and balanced way, those technical screening criteria should be set as a quantitative threshold or minimum requirement, a relative improvement, a set of qualitative performance requirements, process or practice-based requirements, or a precise description of the nature of the economic activity itself where that activity by its nature can contribute substantially to the environmental objectives. (4)Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of 4 June 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation and for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives (OJ L 442, 9.12.2021, p. 1). (5)Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 establishing the statistical classification of economic activities NACE Revision 2 and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 as well as certain EC Regulations on specific statistical domains (OJ L 393, 30.12.2006, p. 1).OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 3/164(8) The technical screening criteria for determining under which conditions an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources should reflect the need to achieve good status for all water bodies and good environmental status for marine waters, and to prevent the deterioration of water bodies that already have good status or marine waters that are already in good environmental status. It is therefore appropriate to focus first on those economic activities and sectors that have the greatest potential to achieve those aims. (9) The Union framework for water protection ( 6)ensures an integrated approach to water management, respecting the integrity of whole ecosystems. The technical screening criteria should therefore aim at addressing the adverse effects of urban and industrial waste water discharges, protecting human health from the adverse impact of any contamination of water intended for human consumption, improving water management and the efficiency of water use, ensuring the sustainable use of marine ecosystem services, contributing to the good environmental status of marine waters and to the overall achievement and maintenance of good status or good potential of bodies of water, including bodies of surface water and groundwater. Technical screening criteria for urban waste water treatment as activity providing a substantial contribution to one or more environmental objectives should be reviewed and where necessary revised, taking into account relevant Union law, including Council Directive 91/271/EEC ( 7). (10) As regards solutions inspired and supported by nature, which provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience, the technical screening criteria should aim at preventing and protecting against floods or droughts while enhancing natural water retention, biodiversity and water quality. (11) The transition to a circular economy is an enabler of environmental sustainability that generates significant benefits for the sustainable management of water, the protection and conservation of biodiversity, the prevention and control of pollution and the mitigation of climate change. The circular economy reflects the need for economic activities to promote efficient use of resources through appropriate re-use and recycling of resources. The technical screening criteria for determining under which conditions an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to the transition to a circular economy should therefore ensure that in the design and production phase, the operator takes into account the long-term value retention and waste reduction of the product over its lifecycle. During its use phase, the product should be subject to maintenance to extend its life, while reducing the amount of waste. The product should be dismantled or treated after its use to ensure that it can be re-used or recycled for the manufacturing of another product. That approach can limit the dependency of the Union’s economy on materials imported from third countries, which is particularly important in respect of critical raw materials. It is therefore appropriate to focus first on those economic activities and sectors that have the greatest potential to achieve those aims.

(7)Council Directive 91/271/EEC of 21 May 1991 concerning urban waste-water treatment (OJ L 135, 30.5.1991, p. 40).OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 4/164(12) When considering the circularity of a product, the design and production phases are key for ensuring durability and potential re-use of the product and for its recyclability. Those phases are also imperative for reducing the content of hazardous substances and substituting substances of very high concern in materials and products throughout their life cycle. The technical screening criteria for manufacturing activities that substantially contribute to the transition to circular economy should therefore set design requirements for products’ longevity, reparability and reuse, as well as requirements on the use of materials, substances and processes that allow for quality recycling of the product. The use of hazardous substances should be minimised. Where possible, the criteria should also require the use of recycled materials for the manufacturing of the product itself. (13) In the follow-up to Communications from the Commission of 11 December 2019 ‘The European Green Deal’ ( 8), of 11 March 2020 on a new Circular Economy Action Plan (9), of 16 January 2018 on a European Strategy for Plastics (10)and of 30 November 2022 on an EU policy framework on biobased, biodegradable and compostable plastics (11), the technical screening criteria for plastic packaging manufacturing should be complemented, reviewed and where necessary revised and taking into account relevant Union law, including Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 12)and its future revisions. (14) In the absence of legally agreed sustainability criteria on the role of biomass in plastic packaging, the technical screening criteria for manufacturing of plastic packaging making substantial contribution to the transition to a circular economy focus on use of bio-waste feedstock. Taking into account future technology and policy developments, including the review of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 13), as well as possible contribution to other environmental objectives, those criteria may need to be reviewed. (15) Good waste management is a building block of the circular economy and helps prevent waste from having a negative impact on the environment and human health. The Union legislation on waste ( 14)improves waste management by setting out a ‘waste hierarchy’ under which waste prevention, preparing for re-use and recycling are the preferred options, followed by other recovery, including energy recovery and only as a last resort, disposal such as incineration without energy recovery or landfilling. The technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which a specific economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to the transition to a circular economy should therefore aim at preventing or reducing waste generation, increasing the preparation for re-use and recycling of waste, avoiding down cycling and disposal of waste. Taking into account that materials suitable for being reintroduced into the circular economy, such as metals and inorganic salts, can be recycled from combustion products, in particular from bottom ashes from non-hazardous waste incineration, the establishment of technical screening criteria for that recycling activity is to be considered.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 5/164(16) Construction and demolition is responsible for 37 % of waste in the Union (15). Ensuring that the materials used in the construction and maintenance process of buildings and other civil engineering objects come mainly from re-used or recycled (secondary raw) materials; and are in turn prepared for re-use or recycling when the built asset is demolished, can therefore play an important role in the transition to a circular economy. Technical screening criteria therefore should be laid down for the construction of new buildings, renovation of existing buildings, demolition or wrecking of buildings and other structures, maintenance of roads and motorways and for the use of concrete in civil engineering projects. Considerations of the circularity of the materials and the built asset need to be taken into account in the design phase, up until the dismantling phase. The technical screening criteria should therefore follow the principles of circular design and production of the built asset, as well as a circular use of materials used to produce that asset. (17) A whole new range of sustainable services, product-as-a-service business models and digital solutions brings about a better quality of life, innovative jobs and upgraded knowledge and skills. In line with the Communication ‘A new Circular Economy Action Plan – For a cleaner and more competitive Europe’, circular economy provides high- quality, functional and safe products, which are efficient and affordable, last longer and are designed for re-use, repair and high-quality recycling. The technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which innovative sustainable services qualify as contributing substantially to the transition to a circular economy should therefore be laid down for activities that contribute to prolonging the life of products. (18) Digital solutions, including the use of digital product passports, can provide real-time data about an item’s location, condition, and availability, and increase the traceability of materials and that way enhance value retention in every design, manufacturing and consumer decision. That in turn enables economic actors to move to circular business models, including product-as-a-service business model, ultimately decoupling economic activities from the use of natural resources and improving an economic activity’s environmental impacts. Technical screening criteria should therefore be established for new digital solutions that can improve the transparency and efficiency of environmental monitoring and regulatory enforcement, including decision-making within integrated water resources management. (19) The technical screening criteria for determining under which conditions an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to pollution prevention and control should reflect the need to eliminate pollution in air, water, soil, living organisms and food resources. Pollution can cause illnesses and in consequence may lead to premature deaths. Its most harmful impacts on human health are typically borne by the most vulnerable groups ( 16). Pollution also threatens biodiversity and contributes to the mass extinction of species. As outlined in the Communication from the Commission of 12 May 2021, Pathway to a Healthy Planet for All EU Action Plan: ‘Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil’ (17), the economic benefits of fighting pollution are substantial and the benefits for society far outweigh the required costs. (20) Following the ambition of the Communication from the Commission of 14 October 2020 ‘Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability Towards a Toxic-Free Environment’ (18), to help to prevent and control pollution it is particularly important to progressively phase out the most harmful substances from products for consumer or professional use except when their use has been proven to be essential for society and to substitute or minimise the production and use of substances of concern, as far as possible.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 6/164(21) Pollution caused by certain pharmaceutical ingredients may pose risks to the environment and to human health as outlined in the Communication from the Commission of 11 March 2019 ‘European Union Strategic Approach to Pharmaceuticals in the Environment’ (19). Technical screening criteria for the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients or active substances and for the manufacturing of medicinal products should therefore aim at promoting the production and use of ingredients that are naturally occurring substances or are classified as readily biodegradable. (22) Preventing and reducing emission of pollutants in the end-of-life phase of products, and the cleaning-up of existing pollution, have a significant potential to protect the environment from pollution and to improve the state of the environment. Technical screening criteria should therefore be established for the collection, transport and treatment of hazardous waste which poses a greater risk to the environment and human health than non-hazardous waste, as well as for remediation of non-conforming landfills and abandoned or illegal waste dumps and of contaminated sites and areas. (23) The technical screening criteria for determining under which conditions an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems should reflect the need to protect, conserve or restore biodiversity to achieve the good condition of ecosystems or to protect ecosystems that are already in good condition. Loss of biodiversity and collapse of ecosystems are one of the biggest threats facing humanity in the next decade ( 20). (24) Conservation of biodiversity has direct economic benefits for many sectors of the economy. The technical screening criteria should therefore aim at maintaining or improving the status and trends of terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats, ecosystems and populations of related fauna and flora species. (25) The value of biodiversity and of the associated services provided by healthy ecosystems is important for tourism as it contributes significantly to the attractiveness and quality of tourism destinations, and therefore to their competitiveness. Technical screening criteria should therefore be established for tourism accommodation activities and should aim at ensuring that those activities follow appropriate principles and minimum requirements to protect and sustain the biodiversity and ecosystems, and to contribute to their conservation. (26) The technical screening criteria for determining whether the economic activities that contribute substantially to one of the environmental objectives cause no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives should aim at ensuring that contribution to one of the environmental objectives is not made at the expense of other environmental objectives. The ‘do no significant harm’ criteria play therefore an essential role in ensuring the environmental integrity of the classification of environmentally sustainable activities. The ‘do no significant harm’ criteria for a given environmental objective should be specified for those activities that present a risk of causing significant harm to that objective. Those criteria should take into account and build upon the relevant requirements of existing Union law. (27) The technical screening criteria for ensuring that activities that contribute substantially to one of the environmental objectives do not cause significant harm to climate change mitigation should ensure that economic activities that have the potential to contribute substantially to environmental objectives other than climate change mitigation do not lead to significant greenhouse gas emissions. (28) Climate change is likely to affect all sectors of the economy. The technical screening criteria for ensuring that economic activities that contribute substantially to one of the environmental objectives do not cause significant harm to climate change adaptation should therefore apply to all of those economic activities. Those criteria should ensure that existing and future risks that are material to the economic activity are identified and that adaptation solutions are implemented to minimise or avoid possible losses or impacts on business continuity.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 7/164(29) The technical screening criteria for ‘do no significant harm’ to sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources should be specified for all activities that may hinder such sustainable use and protection. Those criteria should aim at avoiding that economic activities are detrimental to the good status or the good ecological potential of water bodies, including surface water and groundwater, or to the good environmental status of marine waters, by requiring that environmental degradation risks are identified and addressed, in accordance with a water use and protection management plan or with the Member States’ marine strategies. (30) The technical screening criteria for ‘do no significant harm’ to transition to a circular economy should be tailored to specific economic activities to ensure that those activities do not lead to inefficiencies in the use of resources or to lock-in linear production models, and that waste is avoided or reduced and, where unavoidable, managed in accordance with the waste hierarchy. Those criteria should also ensure that economic activities do not undermine the objective of transitioning to a circular economy. (31) The technical screening criteria for ‘do no significant harm’ to pollution prevention and control should reflect sector specificities to address the relevant sources and types of pollution into air, water or land, referring, where relevant, to best available techniques conclusions established under Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 21). (32) The criteria for ‘do no significant harm’ to protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems should be specified for all activities that can pose risks to the status or condition of habitats, species or ecosystems and should require that, where relevant, environmental impact assessments or other appropriate assessments are undertaken and the conclusions from such assessments are implemented. Those criteria should ensure that even in the absence of a requirement to perform an environmental impact assessment or other appropriate assessment, activities do not lead to the disturbance, capturing or killing of legally protected species or the deterioration of legally protected habitats. (33) As climate change is likely to affect all sectors of the economy, all sectors of the economy will need to be adapted to the adverse impact of the current climate and the expected future climate. Technical screening criteria for substantial contribution to climate change adaptation are to be therefore established in the future for all sectors and economic activities that are covered by the technical screening criteria for substantial contribution to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, to the transition to a circular economy, to pollution prevention and control or to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems set out in this Regulation. (34) The inclusion of new economic activities contributing to environmental objectives pursuant to Articles 12(2), 13(2), 14(2), and 15(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 will widen the coverage of disclosures laid down in Article 8 of that Regulation. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 ( 22), which was adopted on the basis of Article 8(4) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, should therefore be amended to reflect that widened scope. To address certain technical and legal inconsistencies identified since the application of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178, targeted amendments should also be introduced to that Regulation. (35) Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 should therefore be amended accordingly. (21)Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control) (OJ L 334, 17.12.2010, p. 17). (22)Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 of 6 July 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council by specifying the content and presentation of information to be disclosed by undertakings subject to Articles 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU concerning environmentally sustainable economic activities, and specifying the methodology to comply with that disclosure obligation (OJ L 443, 10.12.2021, p. 9).OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 8/164(36) The four environmental objectives referred to in Article 9, points (c) to (f), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and in Articles 12, 13, 14 and 15 of that Regulation are closely interlinked in terms of the means by which an objective is achieved and the benefits that achieving one of the objectives may have on other objectives. The provisions determining whether an economic activity contributes substantially to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, to the transition to a circular economy, to pollution prevention and control or to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, are thus closely interrelated, and are closely linked to the need to widen the disclosure obligations laid down in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178. To ensure coherence between those provisions, which should enter into force at the same time, to facilitate a comprehensive view of the legal framework for stakeholders and to facilitate the application of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, it is necessary to include those provisions in a single Regulation. (37) To ensure that the application of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 evolves with scientific, technological, market and policy developments, this Regulation should be regularly reviewed and, where appropriate, amended as regards the activities considered to be contributing substantially to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, to the transition to a circular economy, to pollution prevention and control, to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, and the corresponding technical screening criteria. (38) This Regulation is consistent with the climate-neutrality objective set out in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 23)and ensures progress on adaptation as referred to in Article 5 of that Regulation. The Commission assessed the consistency of the technical screening criteria for ensuring that economic activities that contribute substantially to one of the environmental objectives do not cause significant harm to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation with the objective and targets of Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 as required by Article 6(4) of that Regulation.

The economic activity does not cover irrigation and abstraction of water resources for desalination of marine or brackish water. The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E36.00 and F42.9, in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006. Technical screening criteria Substantial contribution to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources 1.For the operation of an existing water supply system providing water supply in a sufficient and healthy quality to consumers, and contributing to water resource efficiency, the activity complies with the following criteria: (a) the water supply system complies with Directive (EU) 2020/2184, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/679 (3), and delegated and implementing acts adopted under that Directive; (b) the leakage level of the system is either calculated using the Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI) (4)rating method and the threshold value equals to or is lower than 2,0, or is calculated using another appropriate method and the threshold value is established in accordance with Article 4 of Directive (EU) 2020/2184. That calculation is to be applied across the extent of a specified part of a water supply (distribution) network, i.e. at water supply zone level, district metered area(s) (DMAs) or pressure managed area(s) (PMAs); (c) the water supply systems include metering at consumer level, where water is delivered to a contractual delivery point of the consumers’ own drinking water distribution system. 2.For the construction and operation of a new water supply system, or an extension of an existing water supply system that provides water to new areas or improves that water supply to existing areas, the activity complies with the following criteria: (a) the water supply system complies with Directive (EU) 2020/2184, including the requirements set out in Article 13(8) of that Directive, in Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/679, and in delegated and implementing acts adopted under that Directive; (b) the leakage level of the new or extension system is either calculated using the Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI) rating method and the threshold value equals to or is lower than 1,5 or is calculated using another appropriate method and the threshold value is established in accordance with Article 4 of Directive (EU) 2020/2184. That calculation is to be applied across the extent of the affected and specified part of a water supply (distribution) network where the works are carried out, i.e. at water supply zone level, district metered area(s) (DMAs) or pressure managed area(s) (PMAs); (c) the water supply system includes metering at consumer level, where water is delivered to a contractual delivery point of the consumers’ own drinking water distribution system. 3.For renewal of existing water supply systems, the activity complies with the following criteria: (3)Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/679 of 19 January 2022 establishing a watch list of substances and compounds of concern for water intended for human consumption as provided for in Directive (EU) 2020/2184 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 124, 27.4.2022, p. 41). (4)The Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI) is calculated as current annual real losses (CARL)/unavoidable annual real losses (UARL). The current annual real losses (CARL) represent the amount of water that is actually lost from the distribution network (i.e. not delivered to final users). The unavoidable annual real losses (UARL) take into consideration that there will always be some leakage in a water distribution network. The UARL is calculated based on factors such as the length of the network, the number of service connections and the pressure at which the network is operating.OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 14/164(a) the activity closes the gap by at least 20 % either between the current leakage level averaged over three years, calculated using the Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI) rating method and an ILI of 1,5 or between the current leakage level averaged over three years, calculated using another appropriate method, and the threshold value established in accordance with Article 4 of Directive (EU) 2020/2184. The current leakage level averaged over three years is calculated across the extent of the affected and specified part of a water supply (distribution) network where the works are carried out, i.e. for the renewed water supply (distribution) network at district metered area(s) (DMAs) or pressure managed area(s) (PMAs); (b) a plan with goals and timelines for implementing metering at consumer level is issued by the water supplier and approved by the competent authorities. 4. The water supply system has received the necessary permits for water abstraction. Those abstractions are included in the register for water abstractions, in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC. An assessment of the actual potential for abstraction has been performed, to ensure that the available groundwater resource is not exceeded by the long- term annual average rate of abstraction or that the surface water body from which water is abstracted is not prevented from achieving good ecological status and ecological potential and the abstractions do not deteriorate status or potential of those water bodies. The operation of the water supply system does not result in a deterioration of the status of the affected water bodies, nor does it prevent the water body from achieving good status and good ecological potential in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC ( 5). The information in relation to the abstractions, register of abstractions, status of water bodies and pressures and impacts on these is included in a river basin management plan, or, for activities in third countries, in an equivalent water use and protection management plan. The activity does not involve construction of new supply systems or extensions of existing supply systems where they potentially affect one or more water bodies which are not in good status or potential for reasons related to quantity.

Technical screening criteria Substantial contribution to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources 1.The waste water treatment system does not result in a deterioration of the good status and good ecological potential of any of the affected water bodies and it contributes significantly to the achievement of good status and potential of the affected water bodies, in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC (6). The information related to the status of water bodies, to the activities potentially impacting the status and to the measures taken to avoid or minimize such impacts, is included in a river basin management plan, or, for activities in third countries, in an equivalent water use and protection management plan. The waste water treatment system fulfils the discharge requirements set up by the competent local authorities. The waste water treatment system also contributes to achieve or maintain the good environmental status of marine waters in accordance with Directive 2008/56/EC, where applicable. 2.The waste water treatment system has a collecting system and the provision of secondary treatment. The waste water treatment system complies with the relevant, size-specific requirements for discharges from urban waste water treatment plants set out in Directive 91/271/EEC, in particular Articles 3 to 8 and Article 13 of that Directive and Annex I to that Directive. 3.Where the waste water treatment plant has a capacity of 100 000 population equivalent (p.e.) (7)or more, or of a daily inflow of a five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) load of more than 6 000 kg, it uses a sludge treatment such as anaerobic digestion or a technology with the same or a lower net energy demand (considering both energy generation and consumption), to stabilise the sludge. Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’) (1) Climate change mitigation An assessment of the direct GHG emissions from the centralised waste water system, including collection (sewer network) and treatment, has been performed. The results are disclosed to investors and clients on demand (8). For anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge, a monitoring plan is in place for methane leakage at the facility. (6)For activities in third countries, in accordance with applicable national law or international standards which pursue equivalent objectives of good water status and good ecological potential, through equivalent procedural and substantive rules, i.e. a water use and protection management plan developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders which ensures that (1) the impact of the activities on the identified status or ecological potential of potentially affected water body or bodies is assessed; and (2) deterioration or prevention of good status/ecological potential is avoided. (7)Population equivalent (p.e.) means the organic biodegradable load having a five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) of 60 g of oxygen per day. (8)For example, in line with IPCC guidelines for national GHG inventories for waste water treatment, version of 27.6.2023 available at: https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/pdf/5_Volume5/19R_V5_6_Ch06_Wastewater.pdf.OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN

The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code F42.91 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006. Technical screening criteria Substantial contribution to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources 1.The activity is a quantifiable and time bound measure to achieve the objectives for flood risk reduction in accordance with a flood risk management plan coordinated at river basin scale and developed under Directive 2007/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (14). In relation to drought risk reduction, the activity is a quantifiable and time bound measure to achieve the objectives of Directive 2000/60/EC in accordance with a river basin management plan, or a drought management plan which is part of a river basin management plan. For activities in third countries, the activity is identified as a flood risk reduction or a drought risk reduction measure either in a water use and protection management plan at river basin scale or in an integrated coastal zone management plan along a coast. Those plans pursue the objectives for the management of flood and drought risks to reduce adverse consequences, where applicable for human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activity. 2.Environmental degradation risks related to preserving water quality and avoiding water stress and preventing deterioration of the status of the affected water bodies are identified and addressed to achieve good water status and good ecological potential as defined in Article 2, points (22) and (23), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC, and in line with a river basin management plan, developed thereunder for the potentially affected water body or bodies, in consultation with relevant stakeholders. Environmental degradation risks related to preserving marine environment are identified and addressed with the aim of achieving or maintaining good environmental status as defined in point 5 of Article 3 of Directive 2008/56/EC. 3.The activity includes nature restoration or conservation actions that demonstrate specific ecosystem co-benefits, which contribute to achieving good water status or potential in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC, good environmental status in accordance with Directive 2008/56/EC, and the nature restoration and conservation targets specified in the Communication from the Commission of 20 May 2020 on ‘EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030’ ( 15). The activity contains clear and binding targets on nature restoration or conservation over a clearly defined timeframe and describes measures to achieve those targets. Local stakeholders are involved from the outset in the planning and design phase. The activity is based on the principles outlined by the IUCN Global Standard for nature-based solutions. For activities in third countries, the activity takes into account National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans for the setting of nature conservation and restoration targets and for the description of the measures to achieve these targets. 4.A monitoring programme is in place to evaluate the effectiveness of a nature-based solution scheme in improving the status of the affected water body, achieving the conservation and restoration targets and in adapting to changing climate conditions. The programme is reviewed following the periodic approach of the river basin management plans (including drought management plans, where relevant) and the flood risk management plans.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 23/164Appendix A Generic criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation I.Criteria The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in the table in Section II of this Appendix by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the following steps: (a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Section II of this Appendix may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime; (b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Section II of this Appendix, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks on the economic activity; (c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk. The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan, such that: (a) for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale; (b) for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state-of-the-art climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios ( 1)consistent with the expected lifetime of the activity, including, at least, 10- to 30-year climate projections scenarios for major investments. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports ( 2), scientific peer-reviewed publications, and open source (3)or paying models. For existing activities and new activities using existing physical assets, the economic operator implements physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’), over a period of time of up to five years, that reduce the most important identified physical climate risks that are material to that activity. An adaptation plan for the implementation of those solutions is drawn up accordingly. For new activities and existing activities using newly-built physical assets, the economic operator integrates the adaptation solutions that reduce the most important identified physical climate risks that are material to that activity at the time of design and construction and has implemented them before the start of operations. The adaptation solutions implemented do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities; are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation strategies and plans; and consider the use of nature- based solutions ( 4)or rely on blue or green infrastructure (5)to the extent possible. (1)Future scenarios include Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change representative concentration pathways RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. (2)Assessment Reports on Climate Change: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, published periodically by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change produces, https://www.ipcc.ch/ reports/. (3)Such as Copernicus services managed by the European Commission. (4)Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosystem services (version of 27.6.2023: https://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/index.cfm?pg=nbs).

Agricultural based bio-waste used for the manufacture of plastic packaging complies with the criteria laid down in Article 29, paragraphs 2 to 5, of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Forest based bio-waste used for the manufacture of plastic packaging complies with the criteria laid down in Article 29, paragraphs 6 and 7, of that Directive. 2.The packaging product is recyclable in practice and at scale. The packaging product demonstrates recyclability in practice and at scale by complying with all of the criteria specified below ( 5). 2.1. The unit of packaging (6)is designed to be recyclable, so that it can be sorted and recycled at the end of life and that the resulting recycled material is of such quality that it can be used again in packaging applications. Colours, additives or design elements of the packaging that contaminate the recycling stream once packaging becomes waste and substantially reduce the quality of the resulting recyclates are not used. At best, the unit of packaging is made from the same material (mono- material solution) or, as a minimum, the materials present in the packaging are compatible with the existing recycling streams and sorting processes. Where all packaging components are not compatible with the existing recycling streams and processes, the packaging must allow for separation of its non-recyclable components, either manually by consumers or within the existing sorting and recycling processes. 2.2. In addition, the packaging is evaluated as recyclable at scale where it complies with one of the following criteria: (a) collection, sorting, and recycling is proven to work in practice and at scale: the plastic packaging material of the unit of packaging achieves the minimum recycling rate ( 7)target for plastic packaging waste set by the Directive 94/62/EC, either in the national jurisdiction where the packaging is put on the market, regardless of the jurisdiction’s size, or in Member States that collectively represent at least 100 million inhabitants; (b) collection, sorting and recycling is proven to be on track to work in practice and at scale: sorting and recycling processes are available at the Technology Readiness of Level 9 as defined by ISO 16290:2013 ( 8). 3.When the packaging material is produced, the following substances presenting hazardous properties specified below are not added to the feedstock: (a) substances meeting the criteria laid down in Article 57 and identified in accordance with Article 59(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006; (b) substances meeting the criteria for classification as carcinogenic category 1 or 2 in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and the Council ( 9); (c) substances meeting the criteria for classification as mutagenic category 1 or 2 in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008; (3)The Commission will review these conditions once the revision of Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 1994 on packaging and packaging waste (OJ L 365, 31.12.1994, p. 10) will be adopted. (4)Sustainable bio-waste feedstock refers to industrial bio-waste and municipal bio-waste, it excludes primary biomass in the absence of legally agreed sustainability criteria. (5)The Commission will review these conditions once the revision of Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 1994 on packaging and packaging waste (OJ L 365, 31.12.1994, p. 10) will be adopted. (6)‘Unit of packaging’ means a unit as a whole, including any integrated or separate components, which together serve a packaging function such as the containment, protection, handling, delivery, storage, transport and presentation of products, and including independent units of grouped or transport packaging where they are discarded prior to the point of sale.

Recovery of bio-waste by anaerobic digestion or composting Description of the activity Construction and operation of facilities for the treatment of separately collected bio-waste through anaerobic digestion or composting with the resulting production and utilisation of biogas, biomethane, digestate, compost or chemicals. The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E38.21 and F42.9 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006. Technical screening criteria Substantial contribution to the transition to circular economy 1.The bio-waste that is used for anaerobic digestion or composting is source segregated and collected separately. Where bio-waste is collected in biodegradable bags, the bags have the appropriate compostable certification standard EN 13432:2000 (58). 2.In these anaerobic digestion plants, source segregated bio-waste from separate collection constitutes at least 70 % of the input feedstock, measured in weight, as an annual average. Co-digestion may cover up to 30 % of the input feedstock of advanced bioenergy feedstock listed in Annex IX to Directive (EU) 2018/2001, which may not include contaminated feedstock coming from biomass fraction of mixed municipal and industrial waste. The input does not include feedstock excluded in Part II of Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2019/1009, for Component Material Category (CMC) 3 (Compost) in accordance with point (c) of that category and for Component Material Category (CMC) 5 (Digestate other than fresh crop digestate) in accordance with point (c) of that category. 3.The activity produces one of the following: (a) compost or digestate complying with Regulation (EU) 2019/1009, in particular with requirements of Annex II on the Component Material Categories (CMC), referring specifically to CMC 3 (Compost) and CMC 5 (Digestate other than fresh crop digestate) or with national rules on fertilisers or soil improvers, with equal or stricter requirements compared to those of Regulation 2019/1009; (b) chemicals through the conversion of organic waste to carboxylates, carboxylic acids or polymers by fermentation with mixed cultures. 4. Quality assurance of the production process is performed using Module D1 set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/1009. 5.Compost and digestate complying with Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 or equivalent national rules is not landfilled. The digestate is preferably composted after anaerobic digestion to maximise benefits to the soil it is applied to afterwards, and minimises some potential agro-environmental issues such as release of ammonia and nitrates. 6.Where anaerobic digestion is installed, the produced biogas is used directly for the generation of electricity or heat, upgraded to bio-methane for use as a fuel, directly injected in the gas grid and further used for energy purposes by replacing natural gas, used as industry feedstock to produce other chemicals or converted into hydrogen for use as a fuel. Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’) (1) Climate change mitigation A monitoring and contingency plan is in place to minimise methane leakage at the facility.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 52/164Technical screening criteria Substantial contribution to the transition to a circular economy 1.All generated construction and demolition waste is treated in accordance with Union waste legislation and with the full checklist of the EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol, in particular by setting sorting systems and pre-demolition audits (74). The preparing for re-use (75)or recycling (76)of the non-hazardous construction and demolition waste generated on the construction site is at least 90 % (by mass in kilogrammes), excluding backfilling (77). This excludes naturally occurring material referred to in category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by Decision 2000/532/EC. The operator of the activity demonstrates compliance with the 90 % threshold by reporting on the Level(s) indicator 2.2 ( 78)using the Level 2 reporting format for different waste streams. 2.The life-cycle Global Warming Potential (GWP) of the building resulting from the construction has been calculated for each stage in the life cycle and is disclosed to investors and clients on demand (79). 3.Construction designs and techniques support circularity via the incorporation of concepts for design for adaptability and deconstruction as outlined in Level(s) indicators 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. Compliance with this requirement is demonstrated by reporting on the Level(s) indicators 2.3 (80)and 2.4 (81)at Level 2. (74)EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol, Annex F (version of 27.6.2023: https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/ documents/20509/). (75)‘Preparing for re-use’ means checking, cleaning or repairing recovery operations, by which products or components of products that have become waste are prepared so that they can be re-used without any other pre-processing. This includes, for instance, the preparation for re-use of certain parts of buildings like roof elements, windows, doors, bricks, stones or concrete elements. A pre- requisite for the preparation for re-use of building elements is usually the selective deconstruction of buildings or other structures. (76)‘Recycling’ means any recovery operation, by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances whether for the original or other purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material but does not include energy recovery and the reprocessing into materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations. (77)‘Backfilling’ means any recovery operation where suitable non-hazardous waste is used for purposes of reclamation in excavated areas or for engineering purposes in landscaping. Waste used for backfilling must substitute non-waste materials, be suitable for the aforementioned purposes, and be limited to the amount strictly necessary to achieve those purposes.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 53/1644.The use of primary raw material in the construction of the building is minimised through the use of secondary raw materials (82). The operator of the activity ensures that the three heaviest material categories used to construct the building, measured by mass in kilogrammes, comply with the following maximum total amounts of primary raw material used: (a) for the combined total of concrete (83), natural or agglomerated stone, a maximum of 70 % of the material comes from primary raw material; (b) for the combined total of brick, tile, ceramic, a maximum of 70 % of the material comes from primary raw material; (c) for bio-based materials (84), a maximum of 80 % of the total material comes from primary raw material; (d) for the combined total of glass, mineral insulation, a maximum of 70 % of the total material comes from primary raw material; (e) for non-biobased plastic, a maximum of 50 % of the total material comes from primary raw material; (f) for metals, a maximum of 30 % of the total material comes from primary raw material; (g) for gypsum, a maximum of 65 % of the material comes from primary raw material. The thresholds are calculated by subtracting the secondary raw material from the total amount of each material category used in the works measured by mass in kilogrammes. Where the information on the recycled content of a construction product is not available, it is to be counted as comprising 100 % primary raw material. In order to respect the Waste Hierarchy and thereby favour re-use over recycling, re-used construction products, including those containing non-waste materials reprocessed on site, are to be counted as comprising zero primary raw material. Compliance with this criterion is demonstrated by reporting in accordance with the Level(s) indicator 2.1 ( 85). 5.The operator of the activity uses electronic tools to describe the characteristics of the building as built, including the materials and components used, for the purpose of future maintenance, recovery, and reuse, for example using EN ISO 22057:2022 to provide Environmental Product Declarations ( 86). The information is stored in a digital format and is made available to investors and clients on demand. In addition, the operator ensures the long-term preservation of this information beyond the useful life of the building by using the information managing systems provided by national tools, such as cadastre or public register. (82)For the purposes of the Delegated Act, ‘secondary raw materials’ means materials that have been prepared for re-use or recycled in accordance with Article 3 of the Waste Framework Directive and have ceased to be waste under Article 6 of that Directive. (83)This concerns the material concrete, including its constituent ingredients (for example, aggregates). Any steel reinforcement is excluded since this is a different material which can be accounted for under metals. (84)Bio-based materials are made using biological resources (animals, plants, micro-organisms and derived biomass, including organic waste), as defined in COM(2018) 673. They include conventional bio-based materials made traditionally from biomass (such as wood, cork, natural rubber, paper, textiles, wooden construction materials) and more recently developed materials such as bio-based chemicals or bio-based plastics.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 56/164Technical screening criteria Substantial contribution to the transition to a circular economy 1.All generated construction and demolition waste is treated in accordance with Union waste legislation and the full checklist of the EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol, in particular by setting sorting systems and pre-demolition audits (98). The preparing for re-use (99)or recycling (100)of the non-hazardous construction and demolition waste generated on the construction site is at least 70 % (by mass in kilogrammes), excluding backfilling (101). This excludes naturally occurring material referred to in category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by Decision 2000/532/EC. The operator of the activity demonstrates compliance with the 70 % threshold by reporting on the Level(s) indicator 2.2 ( 102)using the Level 2 reporting format for different waste streams. 2.The life cycle Global Warming Potential (GWP) (103)of the building’s renovation works has been calculated for each stage in the life cycle, from the point of renovation, and is disclosed to investors and clients on demand. 3.Construction designs and techniques support circularity via the incorporation of concepts for design for adaptability and deconstruction as outlined in Level(s) indicators 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. The operator of the activity demonstrates compliance with this requirement by reporting on the Level(s) indicators 2.3 (104)and 2.4 (105)at Level 2. (98)EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol, Annex F (version of 27.6.2023: https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/ documents/20509/). (99)‘Preparing for re-use’ means checking, cleaning or repairing recovery operations, by which products or components of products that have become waste are prepared so that they can be re-used without any other pre-processing. This includes, for instance, the preparation for re-use of certain parts of buildings like roof elements, windows, doors, bricks, stones or concrete elements. A pre- requisite for the preparation for re-use of building elements is usually the selective deconstruction of buildings or other structures. (100)‘Recycling’ means any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances whether for the original or other purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material but does not include energy recovery and the reprocessing into materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations. (101)‘Backfilling’ means any recovery operation where suitable non-hazardous waste is used for purposes of reclamation in excavated areas or for engineering purposes in landscaping. Waste used for backfilling must substitute non-waste materials, be suitable for the aforementioned purposes, and be limited to the amount strictly necessary to achieve those purposes.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 57/1644.At least 50 % of the original building is retained. This is to be calculated based on the gross external floor area retained from the original building using the applicable national or regional measurement methodology, alternatively using the definition of ‘IPMS 1’ contained in the International Property Measurement Standards (106). 5.The use of primary raw material in the renovation of the building is minimised through the use of secondary raw materials (107). The operator of the activity ensures that the three heaviest material categories that have been newly added to the building in the renovation of the building, measured by mass in kilogrammes, comply with the following thresholds regarding the maximum amount of primary raw material used: (a) for the combined total of concrete ( 108), natural or agglomerated stone, a maximum of 85 % of the material comes from primary raw material; (b) for the combined total of brick, tile, ceramic, a maximum of 85 % of the material comes from primary raw material; (c) for bio-based materials (109), a maximum of 90 % of the material comes from primary raw material; (d) for the combined total of glass, mineral insulation, a maximum of 85 % of the material comes from primary raw material; (e) for non-biobased plastic, a maximum of 75 % of the material comes from primary raw material; (f) for metals, a maximum of 65 % of the material comes from primary raw material; (g) for gypsum, a maximum of 83 % of the material comes from primary raw material. The thresholds are calculated by subtracting the secondary raw material from the total amount of each material category used in the works measured by mass in kilogrammes. Where the information on the recycled content of the construction product is not available, it is to be counted as comprising 100 % primary raw material. In order to respect the Waste Hierarchy and thereby favour re-use over recycling, re-used construction products, including those containing non-waste materials reprocessed on site, are to be counted as comprising zero primary raw material. Compliance with this criterion is demonstrated by reporting in accordance with the Level(s) indicator 2.1 ( 110). (106)International Property Measurement Standards: All Buildings. Published by the International Property Measurement Standards Coalition (IPMSC), https://ipmsc.org/. (107)For the purposes of the Delegated Act, ‘secondary raw materials’ means materials that have been prepared for re-use or recycled in accordance with Article 3 of the Waste Framework Directive and have ceased to be waste under Article 6 of that Directive. (108)This concerns the material concrete, including its constituent ingredients (for example, aggregates). Any steel reinforcement is excluded since this is a different material which can be accounted for under metals. (109)Bio-based materials are made using biological resources (animals, plants, micro-organisms and derived biomass, including organic waste), as defined in COM(2018) 673. They include conventional bio-based materials made traditionally from biomass (such as wood, cork, natural rubber, paper, textiles, wooden construction materials) and more recently developed materials such as bio-based chemicals or bio-based plastics.

Demolition and wrecking of buildings and other structures Description of the activity The demolition and wrecking of buildings, roads and runways, railways, bridges, tunnels, waste water treatment works, water treatment works, pipelines, wells and boreholes, power-generating plants, chemical plants, dams and reservoirs, mines and quarries, offshore structures, near shore works, ports, waterway works or land formation and reclamation ( 114). For projects associated with the activities ‘Construction of New Buildings’ or ‘Renovation of existing buildings’ (see Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of this Annex), where the demolition works and the construction or renovation works are procured under the same contract, the technical screening criteria for the construction or renovation activities apply. The economic activity does not include the demolition and wrecking of buildings and other structures carried out as part of the activity ‘Remediation of contaminated sites and areas’ (see Section 2.4 of Annex III). The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code F43.1 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006. Technical screening criteria Substantial contribution to the transition to a circular economy 1.Prior to the start of the demolition or wrecking activity, at least the following aspects from the Level 1 design concept checklist of the Level(s) indicator 2.2 ( 115)checklist are discussed and agreed upon with the client: (a) definition of key performance indicators and target ambition level; (b) identification of project-specific constraints that may compromise the target ambition level (such as time, labour and space) and how to minimise these constraints; (c) details of the pre-demolition auditing procedure; (d) an outline waste management plan that prioritises selective deconstruction, decontamination and source separation of waste streams. Where these actions are not prioritised, an explanation is provided to justify why selective deconstruction, decontamination or source separation of waste streams are not technologically feasible in the project. Cost or financial considerations are not an acceptable reason to avoid complying with this requirement.

For bridges and tunnels, the economic activity only includes the maintenance of the road that runs on the bridge or through the tunnel. It does not include the maintenance of the bridge or tunnel itself. The economic activity includes routine maintenance, which can be scheduled on a periodical basis. The economic activity also includes preventive maintenance and rehabilitation which are defined as works undertaken to preserve or restore serviceability and to extend the service life (125)of an existing road. The maintenance operation is mainly dedicated to pavement management and concerns only the following main elements of the road: binder course, surface course and concrete slabs. The roads in the scope of this economic activity are made of asphalt, concrete or a combination of the two. The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code F42.11 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006. (123)‘Serviceability’ refers to the conditions under which a built asset is still considered safe to use. (124)‘Level of service’ refers to a qualitative or quantitative measure to assess the infrastructure’s ability to cater to the traffic demands placed on it.

This excludes naturally occurring material referred to in category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by Decision 2000/532/EC. 2.Where the road elements (binder course, surface course and concrete slabs) are newly installed after demolition or removal, including any roads which are built on a temporary basis for the purpose of carrying out the maintenance works, at least 50 % (by mass in kilogrammes) of the structural road elements used are re-used or recycled materials or non- hazardous industrial by-products. 3.The re-used or recycled materials are not moved over distances greater than 2,5 times the distance between the construction site and the nearest production facility for equivalent primary raw materials, to avoid that the use of re-used or recycled materials leads to higher CO 2 emissions than the use of primary raw materials. 4.Where newly installed, the binder course has a service lifetime no shorter than 20 years (129). 5.The use of primary raw material for road furniture is minimised through the use of secondary raw materials (130). The operator of the activity ensures that for metals, such as steel restraint systems, a maximum of 30 % of the material come from primary raw material. The threshold is calculated by subtracting the secondary raw material from the total amount of each material category used in the works measured by mass in kilogrammes. Where the information on the recycled content of the construction product is not available, it is to be counted as comprising 100 % primary raw material. In order to respect the Waste Hierarchy and thereby favour re-use over recycling, re-used construction products, including those containing non-waste materials reprocessed on site, are to be counted as comprising zero primary raw material.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 64/164Technical screening criteria Substantial contribution to the transition to a circular economy 1.All generated construction and demolition waste is treated in accordance with Union waste legislation and the full checklist of the EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol, in particular by setting sorting systems (133). The preparing for re-use (134)or recycling (135)of the non-hazardous construction and demolition waste generated on the construction site is at least 90 % (by mass in kilogrammes), excluding backfilling (136). This excludes naturally occurring material referred to in category 17 05 04 in the European List of Waste established by Decision 2000/532/EC. The operator of the activity demonstrates compliance with the 90 % threshold by reporting on the Level(s) indicator 2.2 using the Level 2 reporting format for different waste streams. 2.Construction designs and techniques support circularity via the incorporation of concepts for design for adaptability and deconstruction as outlined in Level(s) indicators 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. Compliance with this requirement is demonstrated by reporting on the Level(s) indicators 2.3 (137)and 2.4 (138)at Level 2. 3.The use of primary raw material is minimised through the use of secondary raw materials (139). For concrete, a maximum of 70 % of the material comes from primary raw material. This criterion applies to in situ poured concrete, pre- cast products, and all constituent materials, including any reinforcement. The threshold is calculated by subtracting the secondary raw material from the total amount of material used measured by mass in kilogrammes. Where the information on the recycled content of the construction product is not available, it is to be counted as comprising 100 % primary raw material. In order to respect the Waste Hierarchy and thereby favour re-use over recycling, re-used construction products, including those containing non-waste materials reprocessed on site, are to be counted as comprising zero primary raw material. 4.The secondary raw materials are not moved over distances greater than 2,5 times the distance between the construction site and the nearest production facility for equivalent primary raw materials, to avoid that the use of re-used or recycled materials leads to higher CO 2 emissions than the use of primary raw materials. (133)EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol, Annex F (version of 27.6.2023: https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/ documents/20509/). (134)‘Preparing for re-use’ means checking, cleaning or repairing recovery operations, by which products or components of products that have become waste are prepared so that they can be re-used without any other pre-processing. This includes, for instance, the preparation for re-use of certain parts of buildings like roof elements, windows, doors, bricks, stones or concrete elements. A pre- requisite for the preparation for re-use of building elements is usually the selective deconstruction of buildings or other structures. (135)‘Recycling’ means any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances whether for the original or other purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material but does not include energy recovery and the reprocessing into materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations. (136)‘Backfilling’ means any recovery operation where suitable non-hazardous waste is used for purposes of reclamation in excavated areas or for engineering purposes in landscaping. Waste used for backfilling must substitute non-waste materials, be suitable for the aforementioned purposes, and be limited to the amount strictly necessary to achieve those purposes.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 84/164Appendix A Generic criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation I.Criteria The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in the table in Section II of this Appendix by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the following steps: (a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Section II of this Appendix may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime; (b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Section II of this Appendix, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks on the economic activity; (c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk. The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan, such that: (a) for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale; (b) for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state-of-the-art climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios ( 1)consistent with the expected lifetime of the activity, including, at least, 10- to 30-year climate projections scenarios for major investments. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports ( 2), scientific peer-reviewed publications, and open source (3)or paying models. For existing activities and new activities using existing physical assets, the economic operator implements physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’), over a period of time of up to five years, that reduce the most important identified physical climate risks that are material to that activity. An adaptation plan for the implementation of those solutions is drawn up accordingly. For new activities and existing activities using newly-built physical assets, the economic operator integrates the adaptation solutions that reduce the most important identified physical climate risks that are material to that activity at the time of design and construction and has implemented them before the start of operations. The adaptation solutions implemented do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities; are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation strategies and plans; and consider the use of nature- based solutions ( 4)or rely on blue or green infrastructure (5)to the extent possible. (1)Future scenarios include Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change representative concentration pathways RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5.

(3)Such as Copernicus services managed by the European Commission. (4)Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosystem services (version of 27.6.2023: https://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/index.cfm?pg=nbs ).

Technical screening criteria Substantial contribution to pollution prevention and control 1.The activity complies with all of the requirements specified below relating to product substitution. 1.1. The API complies with one of the following requirements: (a) the API is a naturally occurring substance, such as vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, nucleotides, carbohydrates and lipids, and, in line with the European Medicines Agency Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMA ERA guideline) ( 1), is generally considered to be degradable in the environment (2); (1)European Medicines Agency Guidelines on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use, version of 27.6.2023 available at: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/environmental-risk-assessment-medicinal-products-human-use-scientific- guideline. (2)Key metabolites are human metabolites likely to be excreted into the environment. Those metabolites are identified in (non-)clinical studies on the metabolism of medicinal products available in the marketing authorisation applications. Such metabolites are to be identified according to EMA/CPMP/ICH/286/1995, page 8. Key transformation products (TP) of these key human metabolites of the parent compound (API) are those that exceed 10 % of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) or Total Organic Carbon (TOC) of the parent compound.OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 90/164(b) where the API does not comply with the requirements specified in point (a), the API, its key human metabolites and its key transformation products in the environment comply with one of the following: (i) are classified as readily biodegradable based on at least one of the test methods from the OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals, Test 301 (A-F), Ready Biodegradability (3), in accordance with the pass value for ready biodegradability as defined in that guideline; (ii) can be concluded to be mineralised based on a specific Test No 308: Aerobic and Anaerobic Transformation in Aquatic Sediment Systems (OECD 308) ( 4)of the OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals (5)compared to persistence criteria as defined in the EMA ERA guideline. 1.2. The API qualifies as an appropriate substitute to another API, within the same therapeutic area or the substance class, that is available in the market or was available during last 5 years and that does not comply with the requirements described in point 1.1. Compliance with this requirement is demonstrated through a publicly available analysis verified by an independent third party. 1.3. The manufacturing process of the API does not involve the use of substances, whether on their own or in mixtures, that meet the criteria set out in Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 except where it is assessed and documented by the operator that no other suitable alternative substances or technologies are available on the market, and that they are used under controlled conditions ( 6). 2.The activity complies with the following requirements regarding the emission of pollutants: 2.1. Where the activity falls within its scope, the emission limit values are lower than the mid-point of the BAT-AEL ranges (7)set out in: (a) the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste gas management and treatment systems in the chemical sector for emissions to air of new installations (or for existing installations within 4 years of the BATC publication) where relevant conditions apply ( 8); (b) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for Manufacture of Organic Fine Chemicals (OFC) (9)for the manufacturing activity under conditions not covered by the BATC mentioned above; (3)OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals, Test 301 (A-F), Ready Biodegradability, version of 27.6.2023 available at: https://www. oecd.org/chemicalsafety/risk-assessment/1948209.pdf. OECD 301 (A-F) test is used to identify substances which are assumed to rapidly and ultimately biodegrade, i.e. mineralised under aerobic environmental conditions. (4)Higher-tier studies (OECD 308) result with so-called half-lives indicating the time after which 50 % biodegradation of the API is achieved. Half-lives acceptable to demonstrate sufficiently quick biodegradation, i.e. non-persistence, according to the Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, Annex XIII, which is also referenced in the EMA ERA guideline, apply. (5)OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals, Test No 308: Aerobic and Anaerobic Transformation in Aquatic Sediment Systems, version of 27.6.2023 available at: https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-308-aerobic-and-anaerobic-transformation-in- aquatic-sediment-systems_9789264070523-en. (6)The Commission will review the exceptions from the prohibition from manufacturing, placing on the market or use of the substances referred to in points (f) and (g) once it will have published horizontal principles on essential use of chemicals. (7)The requirements under this point tackle the pollutants identified under the key environmental issues of each BREF document or the BAT-AEL of the relevant BAT conclusions Commission Implementing Decisions. Where BAT-AEL differentiate between ‘existing’ and ‘new plants’, operators demonstrate compliance with BAT-AEL for new plants. When there is not a BAT-AEL range but a single value, emission levels are below such value. When the BAT-AEL range is expressed as follows: ‘<x-y unit’ (i.e. the lower-end BAT-AEL of the range is expressed as ‘lower than’), the mid-point is calculated using x and y. Averaging periods are the same as in the BAT-AEL of the BREF documents outlined above.

Plants within the BAT-AEL range(s) moving to the mid-point ambition do not trigger any significant cross-media impact. Installations that have been granted a derogation in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 15(4) of Directive 2010/75/EU are not considered as fulfilling the technical screening criteria for the period of the derogation. 2.2. Where a continuous measurement methodology for a certain pollutant is available, the operator applies Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems (CEMS), Continuous Effluent Quality Monitoring Systems (CEQMS) and other measures ensuring the regular verification of non-deterioration of environment. 2.3. The operator applies solvent waste segregation for solvent recovery from concentrated waste streams, where technically applicable. Solvents included in Table 1 of the European Medicines Agency ICH guideline Q3C (R8) on impurities: guideline for residual solvents ( 14)are avoided. The maximum solvents loss from total inputs does not exceed a 3 % loss. Total volatile organic compound (VOC) recovery efficiency is at least 99 %. The operator verifies that no fugitive VOC emission occurs beyond the criteria specified below as to the parts per million volumetric (ppmv) thresholds by carrying out Leak detection and repair (LDAR) campaigns, at least every 3 years. Investments for the use of high integrity equipment are recommended, provided that these are installed in existing plants for cases mentioned under BAT 23 point (b) of the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste gas management and treatment systems in the chemical sector (WGC), whereas the pressure threshold is brought to 200 bar. The minimal verification schedule may be reduced in cases where quantification of total VOC emissions from the plant is periodically qualified with tracer correlation (TC) or with optical absorption-based techniques, such as differential absorption light detection and ranging (DIAL) or solar occultation flux (SOX) or other measures of equivalent performance.

Solvent losses and recovery efficiency of VOC are monitored based on a solvent management plan using a mass balance for verification of compliance, in accordance with Chapter V of Directive 2010/75/EU. 2.4. Sewage, refuse, and other waste (including solids, liquids, or gaseous by-products from manufacturing) are disposed of in a safe, timely and sanitary manner. Containers or pipes for waste material are clearly identified. Analytical data demonstrating the conversion of these substances and their residues to non-hazardous waste materials are available at the facility and kept up to date. Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)(1) Climate change mitigation Where the activity involves on-site generation of heat/cool or co-generation including power, the direct GHG emissions of the activity are lower than 270 gCO 2e/kWh. For the refrigerant threshold, the Global Warming Potential does not exceed 150 in cooling of the substance. Where active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) or active substances are made from substances listed in Sections 3.10 to 3.16 of Annex II to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139, the GHG emissions do not exceed the limits set out in their respective criteria for DNSH to climate change mitigation. The substitution does not lead to an increment of lifecycle GHG emissions. Lifecycle GHG emissions are calculated using Recommendation 2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using ISO 14067:2018 ( 16)or ISO 14064-1:2018 (17). Quantified life-cycle GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party. (2) Climate change adaptation The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.

Where waste water treatment is conducted by an urban waste water treatment plant on behalf of the manufacturing plant, it is ensured that: (a) the load of pollutants released by the manufacturing plant has no negative effect in the treatment process of the urban waste water treatment plant; (b) the load and characteristics of pollutants do not pose any risk or harm to the health of the staff working in waste water treatment plants; (c) the urban waste water treatment plant is designed and equipped appropriately to abate the released polluting substances; (d) the overall load of the concerned pollutants discharged to the water body is not increased compared to the situation where the emissions from the installation concerned remained compliant with emission limit values set for direct releases; (e) the usability of the sewage sludge for nutrient (re)cycling is not affected. For installations where additional pollutant limits or stricter conditions have been included in their environmental permit compared to the requirements of the legislation mentioned above, these stricter conditions apply. 2. Soil and groundwater protection Appropriate measures are in place to prevent emissions to soil and regular surveillance is conducted to avoid leaks, spills, incidents or accidents occurring during the use of equipment and during storage. 3. Water consumption Operators assess the water footprint of the chemical production processes in line with ISO 14046:2014 ( 19)and ensure that they do not contribute to water scarcity. Based on this assessment, operators provide a declaration that they do not contribute to water scarcity which is verified by an independent third party. 4. The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex. (4) Transition to a circular economyThe activity assesses the availability of and, where feasible, adopts techniques that support: (a) reuse and use of secondary raw materials and reused components in products manufactured; (b) design for high durability, recyclability, easy disassembly and adaptability of products manufactured; (18)Joint Research Centre, Best Environmental Management Practice for the Public Administration Sector, 2019, version of 27.6.2023 available at: https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/6063f857-7789-11e9-9f05-01aa75ed71a1/language-en.

Where the activity falls within its scope, the emission limit values shall be lower than the mid-point of the BAT-AEL ranges (26)set out in: (a) the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste gas management and treatment systems in the chemical sector (27)for emissions to air of new installations (or for existing installations within 4 years of the BATC publication) where relevant conditions apply; (b) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for Manufacture of Organic Fine Chemicals (OFC) (28); for the manufacturing activity under conditions not covered by the BATC mentioned above; (c) the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste water and waste gas treatment/management systems in the chemical sector (29); (d) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for the Large Volume Inorganic Chemicals – Solids and Others industry (30); (e) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for the manufacture of Large Volume Inorganic Chemicals – Ammonia, Acids and Fertilisers ( 31); (f) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for the production of speciality inorganic chemicals (SIC) for the manufacturing activity under conditions not covered by the BATC mentioned above ( 32). Plants within the BAT-AEL range(s) moving to the mid-point ambition do not trigger any significant cross-media impact. Installations that have been granted a derogation in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 15(4) of Directive 2010/75/EU are not considered as fulfilling the technical screening criteria for the period of the derogation. 2.2. Where a continuous measurement methodology for a certain pollutant is available, the operator applies Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems (CEMS), Continuous Effluent Quality Monitoring Systems (CEQMS) and other measures ensuring the regular verification of non-deterioration of environment. 2.3. The operator applies solvent waste segregation for solvent recovery from concentrated waste streams, where technically applicable. Solvents included in Table 1 of the European Medicines Agency ICH guideline Q3C (R8) on impurities as specified in the guideline for residual solvents (33)are avoided in medicinal products. (26)The requirements under this point tackle the pollutants identified under the key environmental issues of each BREF document or the BAT-AEL of the relevant BAT conclusions Commission Implementing Decisions. Where BAT-AEL differentiate between ‘existing’ and ‘new plants’, operators demonstrate compliance with BAT-AEL for new plants. When there is not a BAT-AEL range but a single value, emission levels are below such value. When the BAT-AEL range is expressed as follows: ‘<x-y unit’ (i.e. the lower-end BAT-AEL of the range is expressed as ‘lower than’), the mid-point is calculated using x and y. Averaging periods are the same as in the BAT-AEL of the BREF documents outlined above. (27)Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/2427.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 97/164The maximum solvents loss from total inputs does not exceed a 3 % loss. Total volatile organic compound (VOC) recovery efficiency is at least 99 %. The operator verifies that no fugitive VOC emission occurs beyond the criteria specified below as to the parts per million volumetric (ppmv) thresholds by carrying out Leak detection and repair (LDAR) campaigns, at least every 3 years. Investments for the use of high integrity equipment are recommended, provided that these are installed in existing plants for cases mentioned under BAT 23b of the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste gas management and treatment systems in the chemical sector, whereas the pressure threshold is brought to 200 bar. The minimal verification schedule may be reduced in cases where quantification of total VOC emissions from the plant is periodically qualified with tracer correlation (TC) or with optical absorption-based techniques, such as differential absorption light detection and ranging (DIAL) or solar occultation flux (SOX) or other measures of equivalent performance. Diffuse emissions of substances or mixtures classified as CMR1A or 1B from leaky equipment do not exceed a concentration of 100 ppmv (34). The LDAR campaigns have the features described in BAT19 of the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste gas management and treatment systems in the chemical sector, which include detecting, repairing and maintaining leaks within 30 days of detection and a leak threshold is lower than or equal to 5 000 ppmv for substances or mixtures other than those classified as CMR 1A or 1B, which are reviewed and updated for the continuous improvement of the installation. Solvent losses and recovery efficiency of VOC are monitored based on a solvent management plan using a mass balance for verification of compliance, in accordance with Chapter V of Directive 2010/75/EU. 2.4. Sewage, refuse, and other waste (including solids, liquids, or gaseous by-products from manufacturing) are disposed of in a safe, timely, and sanitary manner. Containers or pipes for waste material are clearly identified. Analytical data demonstrating the conversion of these substances and their residues to non-hazardous waste materials are available at the facility and kept up to date. Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’) (1) Climate change mitigation Where the activity involves on-site generation of heat/cool or co-generation including power, the direct GHG emissions of the activity are lower than 270 gCO 2e/kWh. For the refrigerant threshold, the Global Warming Potential does not exceed 150 in cooling of the substance. Where medicinal products are made from substances listed in Sections 3.10 to 3.16 of Annex II to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139, the GHG emissions do not exceed the limits set out in their respective technical screening criteria for DNSH to climate change mitigation. The substitution does not lead to an increment of lifecycle GHG emissions. Lifecycle GHG emissions are calculated using Recommendation 2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using ISO 14067:2018 ( 35)or ISO 14064-1:2018 (36). Quantified life-cycle GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party. (34)Where the exemption under criterion 1.3 applies.

The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E38.22 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006. Technical screening criteria Substantial contribution to pollution prevention and control 1.For all waste treatment processes, the activity complies with the following criteria: 1.1. According to the type of activity, the activity complies with the requirements set out either in the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for waste treatment (48)or the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for waste incineration (49). Facilities that have been granted a derogation in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 15(4) of Directive 2010/75/EU are not considered as compliant with the Technical Screening Criteria. 1.2. During the pre-acceptance procedures, at least the following information is gathered: (a) expected date of arrival at the waste treatment plant; (b) contact details of the waste producer, the sector which the waste originates from and the nature of process producing the waste, including the variability of the process; (c) the estimated quantity expected to be delivered to the operator per delivery and per year; (d) description of the waste, including composition, hazardous properties of the waste, waste code and the suitable treatment route. 1.3.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 102/164(b) documented sampling procedure consistent with relevant standards, such as EN 14899:2005 (50); (c) documented analysis of the relevant physico-chemical parameters for the treatment; (d) a dedicated quarantine waste storage area, as well as written procedures to manage non-accepted waste. The personnel dealing with the pre-acceptance and acceptance procedures is able, due to their profession or experience, to deal with all necessary questions relevant for the treatment of the wastes in the waste treatment facility. The procedures are intended to pre-accepting and accepting wastes at the waste treatment plant only if a suitable treatment route is available and the disposal or recovery route for the output of the treatment is determined. For ‘blending or mixing activities’ (as set out in Annex I, Section 5.1(c) of Directive 2010/75/EU), the operator is not using dilution to lower the concentration of one or more hazardous substances present in the waste, with the aim for the resulting waste mix to be declassified and become ‘non-hazardous waste’ and thus be subsequently treated in facilities non- dedicated to the treatment of hazardous waste. Dilution is not used as a ‘substitute’ to the adequate treatment of the waste. 2.For the physico-chemical treatment of solid or pasty waste, any treatment for the purpose of treating waste prior to final disposal, such as in hazardous waste landfills, is designed to fullfil the following requirements: (a) limit at 6 % the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) maximum concentration in each single input waste to the landfill; (b) limit at 1 000 mg/kg dry matter Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) content of the output waste after a leaching test with L/S = 10 l/kg based on EU Standard EN 12457-2:2002 (51). 3.For the physico-chemical treatment of waste with calorific value, measures are taken in order to avoid dilution and dispersion of hazardous substances, and to avoid any high loads released into the air due to inappropriate final treatment of waste with calorific value. Any treatment installation prior to final thermal treatments (incineration or co-incineration) is to be designed with the purpose of limiting the content of hazardous substances (and meet other related criteria) for each single input waste treated at the physico-chemical treatment installation, so that the acceptance levels at the entrance of the final thermal treatment installations are respected. 4.For the treatment of aqueous liquid waste, the biological treatability of the waste water resulting from the treatment of the water-based liquid waste in a biological waste water treatment plant is judged based on the following criterion: Dissolved Organic Carbon DOC elimination of > 70 % in 7 days (> 80 % when adapted inoculum is used) in accordance with EN ISO 9888 (52)(Zahn Wellens), or other commonly accepted, equivalent industry standards and methodologies used to assess bio-elimination and related performances. 5.For the treatment of waste containing Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP), all waste containing POP substances listed in Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 are controlled and traced as hazardous waste in accordance with Article 17 of Directive 2008/98/EC. Specific requirements of Articles 7(4), 17, 18 and 19 of Directive 2008/98/EC apply. In case of transboundary movement, requirements of Chapter I of the Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (53)apply.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 112/164Appendix A Generic criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation I.Criteria The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in the table in Section II of this Appendix by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the following steps: (a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Section II of this Appendix may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime; (b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Section II of this Appendix, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks on the economic activity; (c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk. The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan, such that: (a) for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale; (b) for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state-of-the-art climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios ( 1)consistent with the expected lifetime of the activity, including, at least, 10- to 30-year climate projections scenarios for major investments. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports ( 2), scientific peer-reviewed publications, and open source (3)or paying models. For existing activities and new activities using existing physical assets, the economic operator implements physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’), over a period of time of up to five years, that reduce the most important identified physical climate risks that are material to that activity. An adaptation plan for the implementation of those solutions is drawn up accordingly. For new activities and existing activities using newly-built physical assets, the economic operator integrates the adaptation solutions that reduce the most important identified physical climate risks that are material to that activity at the time of design and construction and has implemented them before the start of operations.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 126/164Appendix A Generic criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation I.Criteria The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in the table in Section II of this Appendix by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the following steps: (a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Section II of this Appendix may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime; (b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Section II of this Appendix, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks on the economic activity; (c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk. The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan, such that: (a) for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale; (b) for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state-of-the-art climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios (1)consistent with the expected lifetime of the activity, including, at least, 10- to 30-year climate projections scenarios for major investments. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports (2), scientific peer-reviewed publications, and open source (3)or paying models. For existing activities and new activities using existing physical assets, the economic operator implements physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’), over a period of time of up to five years, that reduce the most important identified physical climate risks that are material to that activity. An adaptation plan for the implementation of those solutions is drawn up accordingly. For new activities and existing activities using newly-built physical assets, the economic operator integrates the adaptation solutions that reduce the most important identified physical climate risks that are material to that activity at the time of design and construction and has implemented them before the start of operations. The adaptation solutions implemented do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities; are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation strategies and plans; and consider the use of nature- based solutions ( 4)or rely on blue or green infrastructure (5)to the extent possible. (1)Future scenarios include Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change representative concentration pathways RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. (2)Assessments Reports on Climate Change: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, published periodically by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change produces, https://www. ipcc.ch/reports/. (3)Such as Copernicus services managed by the European Commission. (4)Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosystem services (version of 27.6.2023: https://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/index.cfm?pg=nbs).

Where an Environmental Impact Assessment is carried out in accordance with Directive 2011/92/EU and includes an assessment of the impact on water in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC, no additional assessment of impact on water is required, provided the risks identified have been addressed. The activity does not hamper the achievement of good environmental status of marine waters or does not deteriorate marine waters that are already in good environmental status as defined in point 5 of Article 3 of Directive 2008/56/EC (2), taking into account the Decision (EU) 2017/848 in relation to the relevant criteria and methodological standards for those descriptors. (1)For activities in third countries, in accordance with applicable national law or international standards which pursue equivalent objectives of good water status and good ecological potential, through equivalent procedural and substantive rules, i.e. a water use and protection management plan developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders which ensures that (1) the impact of the activities on the identified status or ecological potential of potentially affected water body or bodies is assessed; and (2) deterioration or prevention of good status/ecological potential is avoided; or, where this is not possible, (3) justified by the lack of better environmental alternatives which are not disproportionately costly/technically unfeasible, and all practicable steps are taken to mitigate the adverse impact on the status of the body of water. (2)The definition laid down in point 5 of Article 3 of Directive 2008/56/EC provides in particular that good environmental status is to be determined on the basis of the qualitative descriptors laid down in Annex I to that Directive.OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
