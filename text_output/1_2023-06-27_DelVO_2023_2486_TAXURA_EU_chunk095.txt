ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 66/164(5) Pollution prevention and
controlComponents and materials used in the construction comply with the criteria set out in
Appendix C to this Annex.
Components and materials used in the construction that may come into contact with
occupiers (144)emit less than 0,06 mg of formaldehyde per m3 of test chamber air upon
testing in accordance with the conditions specified in Annex XVII to Regulation (EC)
No 1907/2006 and less than 0,001 mg of other categories 1A and 1B carcinogenic
volatile organic compounds per m3 of test chamber air, upon testing in accordance
with CEN/EN 16516 (145)or ISO 16000-3:2011 (146)or other equivalent standardised
test conditions and determination methods (147).
Where the new construction is located on a potentially contaminated site (brownfield
site), the site has been subject to an investigation for potential contaminants, for
example by using standard ISO 18400.
Measures are taken to reduce noise, vibrations, dust and pollutant emissions during
construction or maintenance works.
Where appropriate, given the sensitivity of the area affected, in particular in terms of the
size of population and fauna affected, noise and vibrations from construction, use and
maintenance of infrastructure are mitigated by acoustical planning introducing open
trenches, wall barriers or other appropriate measures in compliance with Directive
2002/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (148).
(6) Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosys
­
temsThe activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this Annex.
In addition, the following is to be ensured:
(a) in the EU, in relation with Natura 2000 sites: the activity does not have significant
effects on Natura 2000 sites in view of their conservation objectives on the basis of
an appropriate assessment carried out in accordance with Article 6(3) of Directive
92/43/EEC;
(b) in the EU, in any area: the activity is not detrimental to the recovery or maintenance
of the populations of species protected under Directive 92/43/EEC and Directive
2009/147/EC at a favourable conservation status. The activity is also not
detrimental to the recovery or maintenance of the habitat types concerned and
protected under Directive 92/43/EEC at a favourable conservation status;
(c) outside of the EU, activities are conducted in accordance with applicable law related
to the conservation of habitats and species.
(144)Applying to paints and varnishes, ceiling tiles, floor coverings, including associated adhesives and sealants, internal insulation and
interior surface treatments, such as those to treat damp and mould.
(145)CEN/TS 16516: 2013, Construction products – Assessment of release of dangerous substances –Determination of emissions into
indoor air.
(146)ISO 16000-3:2011, Indoor air – Part 3: Determination of formaldehyde and other carbonyl compounds in indoor air and test chamber air – Active sampling method.
(147)The emissions thresholds for carcinogenic volatile organic compounds relate to a 28-day test period.
(148)Directive 2002/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 June 2002 relating to the assessment and management of
environmental noise – Declaration by the Commission in the Conciliation Committee on the Directive relating to the assessment and
management of environmental noise (OJ L 189, 18.7.2002, p. 12).OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
