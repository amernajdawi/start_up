AR 12. When disclosing the information on the processes to identify transition risks and opportunities as required under
paragraph 20 (c), the undertaking shall explain whether and how it has:
(a) identified transition events (see the table with examples below) over the short-, medium- and long-term and
screened whether its assets and business activities may be exposed to these events. In case of transition risks and opportunities, what is considered long-term may cover more than 10 years and may be aligned with
climate-related public policy goals;
(b) assessed the extent to which its assets and business activities may be exposed and are sensitive to the identified
transition events, taking into consideration the likelihood, magnitude and duration of the transition events;
(c) informed the identification of transition events and the assessment of exposure by climate-related scenario
analysis, considering at least a scenario consistent with the Paris Agreement and limiting climate change to
1.5Â°C, for example, based on scenarios of the International Energy Agency (Net zero Emissions by 2050, Sustainable Development Scenario, etc), or NGFS (Network for Greening the Financial System) climate
scenarios. For the general requirements related to climate-related scenario analysis see paragraphs 18, 19, AR
13 to AR 15; and
(d) identified assets and business activities that are incompatible with or need significant efforts to be compatible
with a transition to a climate-neutral economy (for example, due to significant locked-in GHG emissions or
incompatibility with the requirements for Taxonomy-alignment under Commission Delegated Regulation
(EU) 2021/2139).
