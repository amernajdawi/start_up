[134]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard
Cradle-to-gate inventory  A partial life cycle of an intermediate product, from material acquisition through to 
when the product leaves the reporting company’s gate (e.g., immediately following the
product’s production).
Cradle-to-grave inventory  Removals and emissions of a studied product from material acquisition through to  
end-of-life.
Customer  An entity that purchases, rents, or uses the products of another entity (i.e., a supplier).
Direct emissions data  Emissions released from a process (or removals absorbed from the atmosphere) 
determined through direct monitoring, stoichiometry, mass balances, or similar methods.
Downstream  GHG emissions or removals associated with processes that occur in the life cycle of a 
product subsequent to the processes owned or controlled by the reporting company.7
Emissions factor  GHG emissions per unit of activity data. 
End-of-life stage  A life cycle stage that begins when the used product is discarded by the consumer and 
ends when the product is returned to nature (e.g., incinerated) or allocated to another
product’s life cycle.
Environmentally extended  Emission factors developed through the analysis of economic flows and used to estimate  
 input-output (EEIO)  GHG emissions for a given industry or product category.8 
Extrapolated data  Data specific to another process or product that has been adapted or customized to 
resemble more closely the conditions of the given process in the studied product’s life cycle.
Final product  Goods and services that are ultimately consumed by the end user rather than used in the 
production of another good or service.
Financial activity data  Monetary measures of a process that result in GHG emissions or removals.
First party (self or  Assurance performed by a person(s) from within the reporting company but independent  
 internal) assurance   of the GHG inventory determination process. 
Function  The service provided by the studied product.
Functional unit  The quantified performance of the studied product.9
Gate-to-gate  The emissions and removals attributable to a studied product while it is under the 
ownership or control of the reporting company.
GHG impact  The results calculated when GHG emissions and removals are multiplied by the relevant 
global warming potential (GWP).
