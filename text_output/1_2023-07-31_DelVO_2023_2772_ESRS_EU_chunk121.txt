Metrics and targets
— Disclosure Requirement E3-3 – Targets related to water and marine resources
— Disclosure Requirement E3-4 – Water consumption
— Disclosure Requirement E3-5 – Anticipated financial effects from water and marine resources-related risks
and opportunities
Objective
1. The objective of this Standard is to specify Disclosure Requirements which will enable users of the sustainability
statement to understand:
(a) how the undertaking affects water and marine resources, in terms of material positive and negative actual or
potential impacts;
(b) any actions taken, and the result of such actions to prevent or mitigate material actual or potential negative
impacts, to protect water and marine resources, also with reference to reduction of water consumption, and to
address risks and opportunities;
(c) whether, how and to what extent the undertaking contributes to the European Green Deal’s ambitions for fresh
air, clean water, healthy soil and biodiversity , as well as to the sustainability of the blue economy and fisheries
sectors, taking account of the following: Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the

Council (62)(EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive), Directive 2014/89/EU of the European Parliament and
of the Council (63)(EU Maritime Spatial Planning Directive), the Sustainable Development Goals (in particular
SDG 6 Clean water and sanitation and 14 Life below water), and respect of global environmental limits (e.g. biosphere integrity , ocean acidification, freshwater use, and biogeochemical flows planetary boundaries);
(d) the plans and capacity of the undertaking to adapt its strategy and business model in line with the promotion of
sustainable water use based on long-term protection of available water resources; protection of aquatic
ecosystems and restoration of freshwater and marine habitats;
(e) the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s
impacts and dependencies on water and marine resources, and how the undertaking manages them; and
(f) the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of material risks and
opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on water and marine resources.
2. This Standard sets out Disclosure Requirements related to water and marine resources. With regard to “water”, this
standard covers surface water and groundwater . It includes disclosure requirements on water consumption in the
undertaking’s activities, products and services, as well as related information on water withdrawals and water
discharges.
3. With regard to “marine resources”, this standard covers the extraction and use of such resources, and associated
