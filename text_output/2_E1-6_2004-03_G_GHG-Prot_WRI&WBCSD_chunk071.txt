the target may address a specified subset of the sources
included in the company inventory. The quality of the GHGinventory should be a key factor informing this choice. Thequestions to be addressed in this step include the following:

WHICH GHGS? Targets usually include one or more of
the six major GHGs covered by the Kyoto Protocol.For companies with significant non-CO
2GHG sources
it usually makes sense to include these to increase therange of reduction opportunities. However, practicalmonitoring limitations may apply to smaller sources.

WHICH GEOGRAPHICAL OPERATIONS? Only country
or regional operations with reliable GHG inventorydata should be included in the target. For companieswith global operations, it makes sense to limit thetarget’s geographical scope until a robust and reli-able inventory has been developed for all operations.Companies that participate in GHG programsinvolving trading
2will need to decide whether or not
to include the emissions sources covered in the tradingprogram in their corporate target. If common sourcesare included, i.e., if there is overlap in sources coveredbetween the corporate target and the trading program,companies should consider how they will address any double counting resulting from the trading ofGHG reductions in the trading program (see step 8).

WHICH DIRECT AND INDIRECT EMISSION SOURCES?
Including indirect GHG emissions in a target will
facilitate more cost-effective reductions by increasingthe reduction opportunities available. However, indirect emissions are generally harder to measureaccurately and verify than direct emissions althoughsome categories, such as scope 2 emissions frompurchased electricity, may be amenable to accuratemeasurement and verification. Including indirectemissions can raise issues with regard to ownershipand double counting of reductions, as indirect emis-sions are by definition someone else’s direct emissions(see step 8).

SEPARATE TARGETS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF BUSINESSES?
For companies with diverse operations it may make
more sense to define separate GHG targets fordifferent core businesses, especially when using anintensity target, where the most meaningful businessmetric for defining the target varies across businessunits (e.g., GHGs per tonne of cement produced orbarrel of oil refined).GUIDANCESetting a GHG Target
CHAPTER 11 78BOX 5. Selected corporate GHG targets
ABSOLUTE TARGETS
