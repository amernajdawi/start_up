Member States should be able to inform the Commission on an annual basis of the subsidiar y under takings or
branches of the third-countr y under takings that fulfilled the publication requirement and of the cases where a
repor t was published but the subsidiar y under taking or branch of the third-countr y under taking has state d that it
could not get the necessar y information from the third-countr y under taking. The Commission should make
publicly available on its website a list of the third-countr y under takings that have published a sustainability repor t.
(21) Consider ing the growing relevance of sustainability-related risks and taking into account that small and medium-
sized under takings whose secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulate d mark et in the Union compr ise a
signif icant propor tion of all under takings whose secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulate d mark et in the
Union, in order to ensure investor prot ection, it is appropr iate to require that also small and medium-sized
under takings, excep t micro under takings, whose secur ities are admitte d to trading on a regulated mark et in the
Union disclose information on sustainability matt ers. The introduction of such a requirement will help to ensure
that financial mark et participants can include smaller under takings whose secur ities are admitt ed to trading on a
regulated market in the Union in investment portfolios, on the basis that they repor t the sustainability information
that financia l market participants need.
It will theref ore help to prot ect and enhance the access of smaller under takings whose secur ities are admitte d to
trading on a regulate d mark et in the Union to financia l capital, and avoid discr imination against such under takings
on the part of financia l market participants. The introduction of the requirement for small and medium-sized
under takings, excep t micro under takings, whose secur ities are admitte d to trading on a regulated mark et in the
Union to disclose information on sustainability matte rs is also necessar y to ensure that financial market participants
have the information they need from investee under takings to be able to compl y with their own sustainability
disclosure requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. Small and medium-sized under takings whose
secur ities are admitt ed to trading on a regulated market in the Union should be given the possibility of repor ting in
accordance with standards that are propor tionat e to their capacities and resources, and relevant to the scale and
compl exity of their activities. Small and medium-sized under takings whose secur ities are not admitt ed to trading on
a regulated mark et in the Union should also have the possibility of choosing to use such propor tionat e standards on
a voluntar y basis.
The sustainability repor ting standards for small and medium-sized under takings will constitute a referen ce for
under takings that are within the scope of the requirements introduced by this amending Directive regar ding the
level of sustainability information that they could reasonably request from small and medium-sized under takings
that are suppliers or clients in the value chains of such under takings. Small and medium-sized under takings whose
secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulated mark et in the Union should, in addition, be given sufficient time to
prepare for the application of the provisions requir ing sustainability repor ting, due to their smaller size and more
limited resources, and taking account of the difficult economic circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Theref ore, the provisions on corporat e sustainability repor ting as regards small and medium-sized under takings,
excep t micro under takings, whose secur ities are admitted to trading on a regulate d market in the Union should
apply for financia l years starting on or after 1 Januar y 2026 . Follo wing that date, for a transitional period of two
years, small and medium-sized under takings whose secur ities are admitte d to trading on a regulated market in the
Union should have the possibility of opting-out from the sustainability repor ting requirements laid down in this
amending Directive, provi ded they briefly state in their management repor t why the sustainability information has
not been provi ded.
