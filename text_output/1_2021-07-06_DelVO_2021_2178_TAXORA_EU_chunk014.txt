ANNEX I
KPIs OF NON-FINANCIAL UNDERTAKINGS
1. Content of KPIs to be disclosed by non-financial undertakings
1.1. Specification of key performance indicators (KPI)
1.1.1. KPI related to turnover (turnover KPI)
The proportion of turnover referred to in Article 8(2), point (a), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 shall be calculated as the part
of the net turnover derived from products or services, including intangibles, associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic
activities (numerator), divided by the net turnover (denominator) as defined in Article 2, point (5), of Directive
2013/34/EU. The turnover shall cover the revenue recognised pursuant to International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1,
paragraph 82(a), as adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 (1).
The KPI referred to in the first subparagraph shall exclude from its numerator the part of the net turnover derived from
products and services associated with economic activities that have been adapted to climate change in line with
Article 11(1), point (a) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and in accordance with Annex II to Delegated Regulation
(EU) 2021/2139, unless those activities:
(a) qualify as enabling activities in accordance with Article 11(1), point (b) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852; or
(b) are themselves Taxonomy-aligned.
1.1.2. KPI related to capital expenditure (CapEx) (CapEx KPI)
The proportion of CapEx referred to in Article 8(2), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 shall be calculated as the
numerator divided by the denominator as specified in points 1.1.2.1 and 1.1.2.2 of this Annex.
1.1.2.1. Denominator
The denominator shall cover additions to tangible and intangible assets during the financial year considered before
depreciation, amortisation and any re-measurements, including those resulting from revaluations and impairments, for the
relevant financial year and excluding fair value changes. The denominator shall also cover additions to tangible and
intangible assets resulting from business combinations.
For non-financial undertakings applying international financial reporting standards (IFRS) as adopted by Regulation (EC)
No 1126/2008, CapEx shall cover costs that are accounted based on:
(a) IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, paragraphs 73, (e), point (i) and point (iii);
(b) IAS 38 Intangible Assets, paragraph 118, (e), point (i);
(c) IAS 40 Investment Property, paragraphs 76, points (a) and (b) (for the fair value model);
(d) IAS 40 Investment Property, paragraph 79(d), points (i) and (ii) (for the cost model);
(e) IAS 41 Agriculture, paragraph 50, points (b) and (e);
(f) IFRS 16 Leases, paragraph 53, point (h).
For non-financial undertakings applying national generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), CapEx shall cover the
costs accounted under the applicable GAAP that correspond to the costs included in the capital expenditure by non-
financial undertakings applying IFRS.
Leases that do not lead to the recognition of a right-of-use over the asset shall not be counted as CapEx.
