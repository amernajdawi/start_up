Well documented and verifiable measures are taken to avoid the use of
active ingredients that are listed in Annex I, part A, of Regulation (EU)
2019/1021 (  48 ), the Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed consent 
procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international
trade, the Minamata Convention on Mercury, the Montreal Protocol on
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, and of active ingredients that are
listed as classification Ia (‘extremely hazardous’) or Ib (‘highly hazardous’)
in the WHO Recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard (  49 ). The 
activity complies with the relevant national law on active ingredients.
Pollution of water and soil is prevented and cleaning up measures are
undertaken when pollution occurs.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  In areas designated by the national competent authority for conservation 
or in habitats that are protected, the activity is in accordance with the
conservation objectives for those areas.
There is no conversion of habitats specifically sensitive to biodiversity loss
or with high conservation value, or of areas set aside for the restoration of
such habitats in accordance with national law.
Detailed information referred to in in points 1.2.(i) includes provisions for
maintaining and possibly enhancing biodiversity in accordance with
national and local provisions, including the following:
(a) ensuring the good conservation status of habitat and species, main ­
tenance of typical habitat species;
(b) excluding the use or release of invasive alien species;
(c) excluding the use of non-native species unless it can be demonstrated
that:
(i) the use of the forest reproductive material leads to favourable and
appropriate ecosystem condition (such as climate, soil criteria, and
vegetation zone, forest fire resilience);
(ii) the native species currently present on the site are not anymore
adapted to projected climatic and pedo-hydrological conditions;
(d) ensuring the maintenance and improvement of physical, chemical and
biological quality of the soil;
(e) promoting biodiversity-friendly practices that enhance forests’ natural
processes;
(f) excluding the conversion of high-biodiverse ecosystems into less
biodiverse ones;
(g) ensuring the diversity of associated habitats and species linked to the
forest;
(h) ensuring the diversity of stand structures and maintenance or
enhancing of mature stage stands and dead wood.
