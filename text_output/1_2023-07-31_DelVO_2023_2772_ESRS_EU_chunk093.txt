ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 95/284(h) account for steam, heat or cooling received as “waste energy” from a third party’s industrial processes under
“purchased or acquired” energy;
(i) account for renewable hydrogen (49)as a renewable fuel. Hydrogen that is not completely derived from
renewable sources shall be included under “fuel consumption from other non-renewable sources”; and
(j) adopt a conservative approach when splitting the electricity, steam, heat or cooling between renewable and
non-renewable sources based on the approach applied to calculate market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions.
The undertaking shall only consider these energy consumptions as deriving from renewable sources if the
origin of the purchased energy is clearly defined in the contractual arrangements with its suppliers
(renewable power purchasing agreement, standardised green electricity tariff, market instruments like
Guarantee of Origin from renewable sources in Europe (50)or similar instruments like Renewable Energy
Certificates in the US and Canada, etc.).
AR 33. The information required under paragraph 37 (a) is applicable if the undertaking is operating in at least one high
climate impact sector . The information required under paragraph 38 (a) to (e). shall also include energy from
fossil sources consumed in operations that are not in high climate impact sectors.
AR 34. The information on Energy consumption and mix may be presented using the following tabular format for high
climate impact sectors and for all other sector by omitting rows (1) to (5).
Energy consumption and mix Comparative Year N
(1) Fuel consumption from coal and coal products (MWh)
(2) Fuel consumption from crude oil and petroleum products (MWh)
(3) Fuel consumption from natural gas (MWh)
(4) Fuel consumption from other fossil sources (MWh)
(5) Consumption of purchased or acquired electricity, heat, steam, and
cooling from fossil sources (MWh)
(6) Total fossil energy consumption (MWh) (calculated as the sum of lines 1 to 5)
Share of fossil sources in total  
energy consumption (%)
(7) Consumption from nuclear sources (MWh)
Share of consumption from nuclear  
sources in total energy consumption (%)
(49)Compliant with the requirements in delegated acts for hydrogen from renewable sources: Commission delegated regulation of
10 February 2023 supplementing Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing a Union
methodology setting out detailed rules for the production of renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin;
and Commission delegated regulation of 10 February 2023 supplementing Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament
and of the Council by establishing a minimum threshold for greenhouse gas emissions savings of recycled carbon fuels and by specifying a methodology for assessing greenhouse gas emissions savings from renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non- biological origin and from recycled carbon fuel.
(50)Based on Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the
use of energy from renewable sources.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
