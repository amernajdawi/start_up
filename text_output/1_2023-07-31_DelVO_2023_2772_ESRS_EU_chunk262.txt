Circular economy An economic system in which the value of products, materials and other
resources in the economy is maintained for as long as possible, enhancing
their efficient use in production and consumption, thereby reducing the
environmental impact of their use, minimising waste and the release of
hazardous substances at all stages of their life cycle, including through the
application of the waste hierarchy .
Circular economy principles The European circular economy principles are:
i. usability;
ii. reusability;
iii. repairability;
iv. disassembly;
v. remanufacturing or refurbishment;
vi. recycling;
vii. recirculation by the biological cycle;
viii. other potential optimisation of product and material use.
Circular material use rate Recirculation of materials, components and products in practice after first
use employing the following strategies (in order of preference):
i. maintenance/prolonged use;
ii. reuse/redistribution;
iii. refurbishment/remanufacturing;
iv. recycling, composting, or anaerobic digestion.
The use rate is defined as the ratio of circular use of materials to overall use
of materials.
