ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 284/284Work-life balance Satisfactory state of equilibrium between an individual’s work and private
life. Work-life balance in a broader sense encompasses not only the
balance between work and private life given family or care responsibilities,
but also time allocation between time spent at work and in private life
beyond family responsibilities.
Work-related hazards Work-related hazards can be:
i. physical (e.g., radiation, temperature extremes, constant loud noise,
spills on floors or tripping hazards, unguarded machinery, faulty
electrical equipment);
ii. ergonomic (e.g., improperly adjusted workstations and chairs, awkward movements, vibration);
iii. chemical (e.g., exposure to carcinogens, mutagens, reprotoxic substances, solvents, carbon monoxide, or pesticides);
iv. biological (e.g., exposure to blood and bodily fluids, fungi, bacteria, viruses, or insect bites);
v. psychosocial (e.g., verbal abuse, harassment, bullying);
vi. related to work-organisation (e.g., excessive workload demands, shift
work, long hours, night work, workplace violence).
Work-related incident Occurrence arising out of or in the course of work that could or does result in injury or ill health. Incidents might be due to, for example, electrical
problems, explosion, fire, overflow, overturning, leakage, flow, breakage, bursting, splitting, loss of control, slipping, stumbling and falling, body
movement without stress, body movement under/with stress, shock, fright,
workplace violence or harassment (e.g., sexual harassment).
An incident that results in injury or ill health is often referred to as an
‘accident’. An incident that has the potential to result in injury or ill health
but where none occurs is often referred to as a ‘close call’, ‘near-miss’, or
‘near-hit’.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
