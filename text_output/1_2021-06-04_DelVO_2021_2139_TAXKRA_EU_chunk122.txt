4.14.  Transmission and distribution networks for renewable and low-carbon gases  
Description of the activity  
Conversion, repurposing or retrofit of gas networks for the transmission and distribution of renewable and low-
carbon gases.  
Construction or operation of transmission and distribution pipelines dedicated to the transport of hydrogen or
other low-carbon gases.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular D35.22,
F42.21 and H49.50 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation
(EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. The activity consists in one of the following:
(a) construction or operation of new transmission and distribution networks dedicated to hydrogen or other
low-carbon gases;
(b) conversion/repurposing of existing natural gas networks to 100 % hydrogen;
(c) retrofit of gas transmission and distribution networks that enables the integration of hydrogen and other low-
carbon gases in the network, including any gas transmission or distribution network activity that enables the
increase of the blend of hydrogen or other low carbon gasses in the gas system;
2. The activity includes leak detection and repair of existing gas pipelines and other network elements to
reduce methane leakage.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A

Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council (  187  ) comply, where relevant, with the top class requirements of 
the energy label, and with implementing regulations under that Directive
and represent the best available technology.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
4.15.  District heating/cooling distribution  
Description of the activity
