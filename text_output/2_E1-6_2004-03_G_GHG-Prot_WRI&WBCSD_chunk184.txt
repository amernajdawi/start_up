sequestered atmospheric carbon as it moves through thevalue chain of biomass-based industries. Nonetheless,some issues that would need to be addressed whenaddressing impacts on sequestered carbon in corporateinventories can be examined in the context of existingguidance provided by the
GHG Protocol Corporate
Standard as highlighted below.
SETTING ORGANIZATIONAL BOUNDARIES  
The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard outlines two
approaches for consolidating GHG dataâ€”the equity shareapproach and the control approach. In some cases, itmay be possible to apply these approaches directly toemissions/removals associated with sequestered atmos-pheric carbon. Among the issues that may need to beexamined is the ownership of sequestered carbon underthe different types of contractual arrangementsinvolving land and wood ownership, harvesting rights,and control of land management and harvesting deci-sions. The transfer of ownership as carbon movesthrough the value chain may also need to be addressed.In some cases, as part of a risk management programfor instance, companies may be interested in performingvalue chain assessments of sequestered carbon withoutregard to ownership or control just as they might do forscope 2 and 3 emissions.
SETTING OPERATIONAL BOUNDARIES
As with GHG emissions accounting, setting operationalboundaries for sequestered carbon inventories would helpcompanies transparently report their impacts onsequestered carbon along their value chain. Companiesmay, for example, provide a description of the valuechain capturing impacts that are material to the resultsof the analysis. This should include which pools are
