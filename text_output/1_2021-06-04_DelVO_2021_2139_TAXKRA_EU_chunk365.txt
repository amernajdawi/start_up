(b) favour nature-based solutions (  486  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  487  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  1. The vehicles are not dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels. 
2. For vehicles of category N2 and N3 falling under the scope of
Regulation (EU) 2019/1242, specific direct CO  2 emissions are equal to 
or lower than the reference CO  2 emissions of all vehicles in the same sub- 
group, as defined in Article 3 of that Regulation (  488  ). 
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  N/A  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  Vehicles of category N1, N2 and N3 are both of the following: 
(a) reusable or recyclable to a minimum of 85 % by weight;
(b) reusable or recoverable to a minimum of 95 % by weight (  489  ). 
Measures are in place to manage waste both in the use phase (main ­
tenance) and the end-of-life of the fleet, including through reuse and
recycling of batteries and electronics (in particular critical raw materials
therein), in accordance with the waste hierarchy.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  For road vehicles of categories M and N, tyres comply with external rolling 
noise requirements in the highest populated class and with Rolling
Resistance Coefficient (influencing the vehicle energy efficiency) in the
two highest populated classes as set out in Regulation (EU) 2020/740
and as can be verified from the European Product Registry for Energy
Labelling (EPREL).
Vehicles comply with the requirements of the most recent applicable stage
of the Euro VI heavy duty emission type-approval (  490  ) set out in 
accordance with Regulation (EC) No 595/2009.
Vehicles comply with Regulation (EU) No 540/2014.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  N/A  
___________  
( 486  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta neously 
provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nat ure
and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and syste mic
interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosystem service s
(version of 4.6.2021: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/nature-based-solutions_en/).

and the Committee of the Regions: Green Infrastructure (GI) — Enhancing Europe’s Natural Capital (COM/2013/0249 final).  
( 488  ) All vehicles are required to comply with the criteria for DNSH to pollution prevention and control specified in this section,  
including as regards CO  2 emission levels.
