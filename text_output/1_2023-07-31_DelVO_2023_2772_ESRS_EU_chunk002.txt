of 31 July 2023
supplementing Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards
sustainability reporting standards
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual
financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending
Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC
and 83/349/EEC (1), and in particular Article 29b(1), first subparagraph, thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2013/34/EU, as amended by Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2),
requires large undertakings, small and medium-sized undertakings with securities admitted to trading on the EU
regulated markets, as well as parent undertakings of large groups, to include in a dedicated section of their
management report or consolidated management report the information necessary to understand the undertaking’s
impacts on sustainability matters, and the information necessary to understand how sustainability matters affect the
undertaking’s development, performance and position. Undertakings are to prepare this information in accordance
with sustainability reporting standards starting from the financial year indicated in Article 5(2) of Directive (EU) 2022/2464 for each category of undertakings.
(2) The Commission is required to adopt by 30 June 2023 a first set of standards specifying the information that
undertakings are to report in accordance with Article 19a(1) and (2), and Article 29a(1) and (2) of that Directive,
including at least the information that financial market participants need in order to comply with the disclosure
obligations of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council (
3).
(3) The Commission has taken into account the technical advice provided by the EFRAG. EFRAG’s independent technical advice meets the criteria set out in Article 49(3b), first, second and third subparagraphs, of Directive 2013/34/EU. To
ensure proportionality and to facilitate the correct application of the standards by undertakings, the Commission has
introduced modifications to EFRAG’s technical advice as regards the materiality approach, the phasing-in of certain
requirements, the conversion of certain requirements into voluntary datapoints, the introduction of flexibilities in a number of disclosure requirements, the introduction of technical modifications to ensure coherence with the
Union’s legal framework and a high degree of interoperability with global standard-setting initiatives, as well as
editorial modifications.
(4) These sustainability reporting standards meet the requirements set out in Article 29b of Directive 2013/34/EU.
(5) Common sustainability reporting standards should therefore be adopted.
(6) In accordance with Article 29b(1), fourth subparagraph, of Directive 2013/34/EU this Regulation should not enter into force earlier than 4 months after its adoption by the Commission. Considering that Article 5(2) of Directive
(EU) 2022/2464 requires certain categories of undertakings to apply these sustainability reporting standards for
financial years starting on or after 1 January 2024, this Regulation should enter into force on the third day
following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

(OJ L 322, 16.12.2022, p. 15).
