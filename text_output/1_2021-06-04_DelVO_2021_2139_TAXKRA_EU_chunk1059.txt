Claims under the reinsurance activity, both ongoing and those from large-scale loss events resulting from risks
stemming from climate-related perils, are processed fairly with respect to customers, in accordance with high
handling standards for claims and in timely fashion in line with applicable law and there has been no failure to do
so in the context of recent large-scale loss events. Where appropriate, the reinsurer supports the insurer or the
reinsurance intermediary in assessing the claims from the underlying product. Information as regards procedures
on additional measures by the reinsurer in case of large-scale loss events is publicly available.
