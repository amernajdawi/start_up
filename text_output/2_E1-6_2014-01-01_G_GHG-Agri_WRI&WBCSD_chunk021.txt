Notes:  
1. Data are from U.S. EPA (2006a) and exclude emi ssions sources located upstream or downstream of
farms.
2. Data exclude LUC emissions.  
3. The ‘soil carbon’ value represents  the net emissions from agricultural soils after subtracting C 
sequestration from gross soil C emissions. It represents the summed effect of different management practices on soil organic C.

Notes:  
1. The actual emissions profile of a farm may (and in many cases will) deviate from the pattern in this
figure, depending on the soil, climate and management conditions concerned.  
2. Figure based on expert opinion of the Technical Working Group.  

4.2 Individual agricultural sources

Non-mechanical sources
The non-mechanical sources that are globally largest in magnitude are:

Enteric fermentation (CH 4)
CH 4 is produced in herbivores as a by-product of enteric fermentation, whereby
carbohydrates are broken down by bacteria in  the digestive tract . The amount of CH 4 that 
is produced depends on:
 The type of animal. Ruminant livestock have an expansive chamber, the rumen,
which fosters extensive enteric fermentation and high CH 4 emissions. The main
ruminant livestock are cattle, buffalo, goats , sheep, and deer. Non-ruminant livestock
(horses, mules, donkeys) and monogastric li vestock (swine) have relatively lower
CH 4 emissions.
 Quantity and composition of feed. Generally, the higher the feed intake, the higher
the CH 4 emissions.  
 Age and size of livestock. Feed intake incr eases with animal size, growth rate, and
production (e.g., milk production, w ool growth, or pregnancy).
