technological neutrality , consider ing both the shor t- and long-t erm impact of a given economic activity ;
(b) specify the minimum requirements that need to be met to avoid significant harm to any of the relevant environmental
objectives, consider ing both the shor t- and long-ter m impact of a given economic activity ;
(c) be quantitative and contain thresholds to the extent possible, and other wise be qualitative;
(d) where appropr iate, build upon Union labelling and certification schemes, Union methodologies for assessing
envi ronmental footpr int, and Union statistical classification systems, and take into account any relevant existing Union
legislation;
(e) where feasible, use sustainability indicator s as refer red to in Article 4(6) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088;
(f) be based on conclusive scientifi c evidence and the precautionar y principle enshr ined in Article 191 TFEU;
(g) take into account the life cycle, including evidence from existing life-cy cle assessments, by consider ing both the
envi ronmental impact of the economic activity itself and the environmental impact of the products and services
provided by that economic activity , in particular by consider ing the production, use and end of life of those products
and services;
(h) take into account the nature and the scale of the economic activity , including:
(i) whether it is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 16; or
(ii) whether it is a transitional activity as referred to in Article 10(2);
(i) take into account the potential market impact of the transition to a more sustainable econom y, including the risk of

2. The technical screening criteria referred to in paragraph 1 shall also include criteria for activities relat ed to the clean
energy transition consistent with a pathwa y to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 0C abov e pre-industr ial levels, in
particular energy efficiency and renewable energy , to the exte nt that those activities substantially contr ibut e to any of the
environmental objectives.
3. The technical screening criteria referred to in paragraph 1 shall ensure that power generation activities that use solid
fossil fuels do not qualify as environmentally sustainable economic activities.
4. The technical screening criteria referred to in paragraph 1 shall also include criteria for activities related to the switc h
to clean or climate -neutral mobility , including through modal shift, efficiency measures and alternative fuels, to the exte nt
that those are substantially contr ibuting to any of the environmental objectives. EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 198/36                                                                                                                                         22.6.2020
