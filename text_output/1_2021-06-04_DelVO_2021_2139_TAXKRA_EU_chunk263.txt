3. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and
take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line
with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports (  155  ), scientific peer-reviewed 
publications and open source (  156  ) or paying models. 
4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people,
of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  157  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  158  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  The activity complies with the life cycle GHG emissions savings 
requirement of 70 % relative to a fossil fuel comparator of 94 g
CO  2 e/MJ as set out in Article 25(2) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the 
European Parliament and of the Council (  159  ) and Annex V to that 
Directive.
Life cycle GHG emissions savings are calculated using the methodology
referred to in Article 28(5) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 or, alternatively,
using ISO 14067:2018 (  160  ) or ISO 14064-1:2018 (  161  ). 
Quantified life-cycle GHG emission savings are verified in line with
Article 30 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 where applicable, or by an inde ­
pendent third party.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.

( 157  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta n­
eously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more
diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-eff icient
and systemic interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of
ecosystem services (version of 4.6.2021: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/nature-
based-solutions_en/).
