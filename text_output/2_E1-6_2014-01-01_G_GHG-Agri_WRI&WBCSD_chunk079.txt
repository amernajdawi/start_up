General GHG flux data
 Data for all seven GHGs (CO 2, CH 4, N2O, SF 6, PFCs, HFCs and NF 3), disaggregated
by GHG and reported in units of both metric tonnes and tonnes CO 2-equivalent
(CO 2e)
 Total scope 1 and 2 emissions without subtractions for trades in offsets
 Data disaggregated by scope  
 A reference or link to the calculation methodologies used  

9.2 Minimum, best practice, rec ommendations for reporting
agricultural GHG fluxes  

Companies should publicly report  the following information:  
 For non-mechanical sources: A description of whether the calculation methodologies
are IPCC Tier 1, 2, or 3, and a description of how those methodologies were chosen
based on the quality criteria in Chapter 7.3
 Scope 1 emissions disaggregated by m echanical sources, LUC (biogenic CO 2 only),
and all other non-mechanical sources   
 Net CO 2 flux data for the C stocks in above-ground and below-ground biomass,
DOM and soils (in tonnes CO 2), to the extent relevant and required, as defined in
Chapter 8.2
 Where LUC results in a reduction in the size of C stocks, the CO 2 emissions are
reported in Scope 1 (LUC is further defined in Box 9-1)
 Otherwise, all CO 2 fluxes are reported outside of th e scopes in a separate category
(‘Biogenic Carbon’) that ha s three components: (1) CO 2 fluxes (emissions or
removals) during land use management; (2 ) Sequestration during LUC; and (3) CO 2
emissions from biofuel combustion  
 A description of the methodology used (where relevant) to amortize the CO 2 fluxes
to/from C stocks  
 Assumptions regarding any use of proxy data in calculating the impacts of historical
changes in management on C stocks  
 Any exclusions of the impacts of histor ical management practices on C stocks  
Figure 9-1 summarizes how  GHG data should be separated within an inventory following 
these requirements and best practice recommendations.
