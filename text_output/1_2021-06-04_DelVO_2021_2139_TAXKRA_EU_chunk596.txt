3. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and
take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line
with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports (  254  ), scientific peer-reviewed 
publications and open source (  255  ) or paying models. 
4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people,
of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  256  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  257  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  The direct GHG emissions of the activity are lower than 270 g CO  2 e/kWh.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  1. The activity complies with the provisions of Directive 2000/60/EC, 
in particular with all the requirements laid down in Article 4 of the
Directive.
2. For operation of existing hydropower plants, including refurbishment
activities to enhance renewable energy or energy storage potential, the
activity complies with the following criteria:
2.1. In accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular
Articles 4 and 11 of that Directive, all technically feasible and ecologically
relevant mitigation measures have been implemented to reduce adverse
impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly
dependent on water.
2.2. Measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems
naturally present in the affected water bodies:
(a) measures to ensure downstream and upstream fish migration (such as
fish friendly turbines, fish guidance structures, state-of-the-art fully
functional fish passes, measures to stop or minimise operation and
discharges during migration or spawning);
