(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  Releases of ballast water containing non-indigenous species are prevented 
in line with the International Convention for the Control and Management
of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments (BWM).
Measures are in place to prevent the introduction of non-indigenous
species by biofouling of hull and niche areas of ships taking into
account the IMO Biofouling Guidelines (  524  ). 
Noise and vibrations are limited by using noise reducing propellers, hull
design or on-board machinery in line with the guidance given in the IMO
Guidelines for the Reduction of Underwater Noise (  525  ). 
In the Union, the activity does not hamper the achievement of good
environmental status, as set out in Directive 2008/56/EC, requiring that
the appropriate measures are taken to prevent or mitigate impacts in
relation to that Directive’s Descriptors 1 (biodiversity), 2 (non-indigenous
species), 6 (seabed integrity), 8 (contaminants), 10 (marine litter), 11
(Noise/Energy) and as set out in Commission Decision (EU) 2017/848
in relation to the relevant criteria and methodological standards for
those descriptors, as applicable.  
6.12.  Retrofitting of sea and coastal freight and passenger water transport  
Description of the activity  
Retrofit and upgrade of vessels designed and equipped for the transport of freight or passengers on sea or coastal
waters, and of vessels required for port operations and auxiliary activities, such as tugboats, mooring vessels, pilot
vessels, salvage vessels and ice-breakers.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE codes H50.10, H50.2, H52.22, C33.15,
N77.21 and N.77.34 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by
Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
