FranchisesFINANCIAL ACCOUNTING DEFINITION
The parent company has the ability to direct the financial and
operating policies of the company with a view to gainingeconomic benefits from its activities. Normally, this categoryalso includes incorporated and non-incorporated joint venturesand partnerships over which the parent company has financialcontrol. Group companies/  subsidiaries are fully consolidated,which implies that 100 percent of the subsidiary’s income,expenses, assets, and liabilities are taken into the parentcompany’s profit and loss account and balance sheet, respec-tively. Where the parent’s interest does not equal 100 percent,the consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheetshows a deduction for the profits and net assets belonging tominority owners. 
The parent company has significant influence over the operating
and financial policies of the company, but does not have finan-cial control. Normally, this category also includes incorporatedand non-incorporated joint ventures and partnerships over whichthe parent company has significant influence, but not financialcontrol. Financial accounting applies the equity share method to associated/  affiliated companies, which recognizes the parentcompany’s share of the associate’s profits and net assets. 
Joint ventures/  partnerships/operations are proportionally
consolidated, i.e., each partner accounts for their propor-tionate interest of the joint venture’s income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.
The parent company has neither significant influence nor financial
control. This category also includes incorporated and non-incorporated joint ventures and partnerships over which the parentcompany has neither significant influence nor financial control.Financial accounting applies the cost/  dividend method to fixedasset investments. This implies that only dividends received arerecognized as income and the investment is carried at cost. 
Franchises are separate legal entities. In most cases, the fran-
chiser will not have equity rights or control over the franchise.Therefore, franchises should not be included in consolidation ofGHG emissions data. However, if the franchiser does have equityrights or operational/  financial control, then the same rules for consolidation under the equity or control approaches apply.ACCOUNTING FOR GHG EMISSIONS ACCORDING TO
