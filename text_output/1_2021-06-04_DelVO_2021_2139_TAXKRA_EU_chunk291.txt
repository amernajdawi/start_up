(4) Transition to a circular economy  The activity assesses availability of and, where feasible, uses equipment and 
components of high durability and recyclability and that are easy to
dismantle and refurbish.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  Measures are in place to minimise toxicity of anti-fouling paint and 
biocides as laid down in Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, which implements
in Union law the International Convention on the Control of Harmful
Anti-fouling Systems on Ships adopted on 5 October 2001.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.
The activity does not hamper the achievement of good environmental
status, as set out in Directive 2008/56/EC, requiring that the appropriate
measures are taken to prevent or mitigate impacts in relation to that
Directive’s Descriptor 1 (biodiversity), laid down in Annex I to that
Directive, and as set out in Decision (EU) 2017/848 in relation to the
relevant criteria and methodological standards for that descriptor.  
4.5.  Electricity generation from hydropower  
Description of the activity  
Construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity from hydropower.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular D35.11 and
F42.22 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.
The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan,
such that:
(a) for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using
climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale;
(b) for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state-of-the-art
climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios (  253  ) consistent with the expected lifetime 
of the activity, including, at least, 10 to 30 year climate projections scenarios for major investments.
