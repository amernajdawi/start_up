(5) Pollution prevention and control  For composting plants treating over 75 tonnes per day, emissions to air 
and water are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out for aerobic treatment of
waste in the latest relevant best available techniques (BAT) conclusions,
including the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for waste treat ­
ment (  426  ). No significant cross-media effects occur. 
The site has a system in place that prevents leachate reaching groundwater.
The compost produced meets the requirements for fertilising materials set
out in Component Material Category 3 in Annex II to Regulation (EU)
2019/1009 or national rules on fertilisers or soil improvers for agricultural
use.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
5.9.  Material recovery from non-hazardous waste  
Description of the activity  
Construction and operation of facilities for the sorting and processing of separately collected non-hazardous waste
streams into secondary raw materials involving mechanical reprocessing, except for backfilling purposes.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular E38.32 and
F42.99 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex
may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.
The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan,
such that:
(a) for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using
climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale;
(b) for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state-of-the-art
climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios (  427  ) consistent with the expected lifetime 
of the activity, including, at least, 10 to 30 year climate projections scenarios for major investments.
