Chapter Requirements
9. Allocation • Companies shall allocate emissions and removals to accurately reflect the
contributions of the studied product and co-product(s) to the total emissions and
removals of the common process
• Companies shall avoid allocation wherever possible by using process subdivision,
redefining the functional unit, or using system expansion
• If allocation is unavoidable, companies shall allocate emissions and removals based on
the underlying physical relationships between the studied product and co-product(s)
• When physical relationships alone cannot be established or used as the basis  
for allocation, companies shall select either economic allocation or another
allocation method that reflects other relationships between the studied product
and co-product(s)
• Companies shall apply the same allocation methods to similar inputs and outputs
within the product’s life cycle
• For allocation due to recycling, companies shall use either the closed loop
approximation method or the recycled content method as defined by this standard
• When using the closed loop approximation method, companies shall report
displaced emissions and removals separately from the end-of-life stage
• Companies shall disclose and justify the methods used to avoid allocation or
perform allocation
• When using the closed loop approximation method, companies shall report
displaced emissions and removals separately from the studied product’s end-of-
life stage inventory
10.  Assessing  
Uncertainty  • Companies shall report a qualitative statement on inventory uncertainty and 
methodological choices. Methodological choices include:
•Use and end-of-life profile
•Allocation methods, including allocation due to recycling
•Source of global warming potential (GWP) values used
•Calculation models
11.  Calculating  
Inventory Results• Companies shall apply a 100-year GWP factor to GHG emissions and removals data
to calculate the inventory results in units of CO2 equivalent (CO2e)
• Companies shall report the source and date of the GWP factors used
• Companies shall quantify and report the following:
•Total inventory results in CO2e per unit of analysis, which includes all emissions
and removals included in the boundary from biogenic sources, non-biogenic
sources, and land-use change impacts
•Percentage of total inventory results by life cycle stage
•Biogenic and non-biogenic emissions and removals separately when applicable
•Land-use change impacts separately when applicable
•Cradle-to-gate and gate-to-gate inventory results separately or a clear
statement that confidentiality is a limitation to providing this information
• Companies shall not include the following when quantifying inventory results:
weighting factors for delayed emissions; offsets; and avoided emissions
• Companies shall report the amount of carbon contained in the product or its
components that is not released to the atmosphere during waste treatment,  
if applicable
• For cradle-to-gate inventories, companies shall report the amount of carbon
contained in the intermediate product
