products that have already been used for their intended purpose by a customer (physical person or legal person).

reuse is not possible (due to damage, degradation or hazardous substances), are recycled, or, only where reuse and
recycling is not viable, are disposed of in accordance with applicable Union and national legislation. For
remanufacturing, the waste management plan is accessible to the public.
