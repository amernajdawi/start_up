ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 124/164The activity does not have significant adverse effects on protected areas (UNESCO World Heritage sites, Key Biodiversity
Areas, as well as other protected areas than Natura 2000 sites) and protected species, based on an assessment of its impact
that takes into account the best available knowledge (32). The activity is not detrimental to the recovery or maintenance of
the populations of the species and of the habitat types protected under national law at a favourable conservation status.
In the Union, in relation to Natura 2000 sites, the activity does not have significant effects on Natura 2000 sites in view of
their conservation objectives on the basis of an appropriate assessment carried out in accordance with Article 6(3) of
Directive 92/43/EEC.
In the Union, in any area, the activity is not detrimental to the recovery or maintenance of the populations of the species
protected under Directives 92/43/EEC and 2009/147/EC at a favourable conservation status. The activity is also not
detrimental to the recovery or maintenance of the habitat types protected under Directive 92/43/EEC at a favourable
conservation status.
4.2. The introduction of invasive alien species is prevented or their spread is managed in accordance with Regulation (EU)
No 1143/2014.4.3. Recreational hunting and fishing activities are allowed only where they are explicitly included as part of the
conservation or management plan of the conservation area as established by the management entity and carried out in
accordance with applicable Union and national law.
5.Audit
At the beginning of the activity and at least every five years thereafter, the compliance with the technical screening criteria is
controlled by the relevant national competent authorities or by an independent third-party certifier, such as a dedicated
certification or accreditation scheme, at the request of national authorities or the operator of the activity.
The independent third-party certifier may not have any conflict of interest, in particular with the owner or the funder, and
may not be involved in the development or operation of the activity.
In order to reduce costs, audits may be performed together with any other audit.
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)(1) Climate change mitigation For buildings built before 31 December 2020, the building has at least an Energy
Performance Certificate (EPC) class C. As an alternative, the building is within the top
30 % of the national or regional building stock expressed as operational Primary
Energy Demand (PED) and demonstrated by adequate evidence, which at least
compares the performance of the relevant asset to the performance of the national or
regional stock built before 31 December 2020 and at least distinguishes between
residential and non-residential buildings.
For buildings built after 31 December 2020, the Primary Energy Demand (PED) (
33)
defining the energy performance of the building resulting from the construction does
not exceed the threshold set for the nearly zero-energy building (NZEB) requirements
in national regulation implementing Directive 2010/31/EU. The energy performance is
certified by an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC).
(32)For activities located in third countries, in accordance with equivalent applicable national law or international standards, that aim at
the conservation of natural habitats, wild fauna and wild flora, and that require to carry out (1) a screening procedure to determine
whether, for a given activity, an appropriate assessment of the possible impacts on protected habitats and species is needed; (2) such
an appropriate assessment where the screening determines that it is needed, for example IFC Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources.
(33)The calculated amount of energy needed to meet the energy demand associated with the typical uses of a building expressed by a
numeric indicator of total primary energy use in kWh/m2 per year and based on the relevant national calculation methodology and as
displayed on the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC).OJ L, 21.11.2023 EN
