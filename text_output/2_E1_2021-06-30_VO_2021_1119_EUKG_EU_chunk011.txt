carbon removals based on robust and transparent carbon accounting to monitor and verify the authenticity of
carbon removals, while ensur ing that there are no negative impacts on the environment, in particular biodiversity ,
on public health or on social or economic objectives.
(23) The restoration of ecosystems would assist in maintaining, managing and enhancing natural sinks and promote
biodiversity while fighting climat e change . Further more, the ‘triple role’ of forests, namely , as carbon sinks, storage
and substitution, contr ibut es to the reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, while ensur ing that forests
continue to grow and provide man y other services.
(24) Scientific exper tise and the best available, up-to -date evidence, together with information on climate chang e that is
both factual and transparent, are imperative and need to under pin the Union’s climat e action and efforts to reach
climat e neutrality by 2050. A European Scientific Advisor y Board on Climate Change (the ‘Advisor y Board’) should
be established to serve as a point of referen ce on scientific kno wledge relating to climate change by virtue of its
independence and scientific and technical exper tise. The Advisor y Board should complement the work of the
European Envi ronment Agen cy (EEA) while acting independently in disc harging its tasks. Its mission should avoid
any overlap with the mission of the IPCC at international level. Regulation (EC) No 401/2009 of the European
Parliament and of the Council (11)should theref ore be amended in order to establish the Advisor y Board. National
climat e advisor y bodies can play an important role in, inter alia, provid ing exper t scientific advice on climat e policy
to the relevant national author ities as prescr ibed by the Member State concer ned in those Member States where they
exist. Theref ore, Member States that have not already done so are invit ed to establish a national climat e advisor y
body .
(25) The transition to climate neutrality requires change s across the entire policy spectr um and a collective effort of all
sector s of the economy and society , as highlighted in the European Green Deal. The European Council, in its
conclusions of 12 December 2019 , stated that all relevant Union legislation and policies need to be consistent with,
and contr ibut e to, the fulfilme nt of the climat e-neutrality objective while respecting a level playing field, and invited
the Commission to examine whether this requires an adjustment of the existing rules.
(26) As announced in the European Green Deal, the Commission assessed the Union’s 2030 target for greenhouse gas
emission reduction, in its communication of 17 September 2020 entitled ‘Stepping up Europe ’s 2030 climat e
ambition – Investing in a climate -neutral future for the benefi t of our people ’. The Commission did so on the basis
of a compre hensive impact assessment and taking into account its analysis of the integrat ed national energy and
climat e plans submitted to it in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the
Council (12). In light of the 2050 climate-neutrality objective, by 2030 greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced
and remo vals enhanced, so that net greenhouse gas emissions, that is emissions after the deduction of removals, are
reduced economy-wide and domestically by at least 55 % by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The European Council
endorsed that target in its conclusions of 10and 11 December 2020 . It also provid ed initial guidance on its
imp lementation. That new Union 2030 climate target is a subsequent target for the purposes of point (11) of
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, and theref ore replaces the 2030 Union-wide target for greenhouse gas
emissions set out in that point. In addition, the Commission should, by 30 June 2021 , assess how the relevant
Union legislation imp lementing the Union 2030 climat e target would need to be amended in order to achieve such
net emission reductions. In view of this, the Commission has announced a revision of the relevant climate and
