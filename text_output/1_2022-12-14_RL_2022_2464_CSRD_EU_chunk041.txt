(42) Sustainability repor ting standards should take account of the Guidelines on non-f inancial repor ting and the
Guidelines on repor ting climat e-relat ed information. They should also take account of other repor ting requirements
in Directive 2013/34/EU that are not directly related to sustainability , with the aim of provi ding the users of the
repor ted information with a better understanding of the development, performa nce, position and impact of the
under taking, by maximising the link s between the sustainability information and other information repor ted in
accordance with Directive 2013/34/EU.
(43) Sustainability repor ting standards should be propor tionate and should not impose an unnecessar y administrative
burden on companies that are required to use them. In order to minimise disrupti on for under takings that already
repor t sustainability information, sustainability repor ting standards should take account of existing standards and
framewor ks for sustainability repor ting and accounting where appropr iate. Such existing standards and frameworks
include the Global Repor ting Initiative, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, the Internatio nal Integrated
Repor ting Council, the Intern ational Accounting Standards Board, the Task Force on Climate-r elated Financial
Disclosures, the Carbon Disclosure Standards Board, and CDP , formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project.
Union standards should take account of any sustainability repor ting standards developed under the auspices of
Internatio nal Financial Repor ting Standards Foundation. To avoid unnecessar y regulator y fragmentation that could
have nega tive consequences for under takings operating globally , Union sustainability repor ting standards should
contr ibut e to the process of converg ence of sustainability repor ting standards at global level, by suppor ting the
work of the Internati onal Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). Union sustainability repor ting standards should
reduce the risk of inconsist ent repor ting requirements for under takings that operat e globally by integrat ing the
conte nt of global baseline standards to be developed by the ISSB, to the extent that the content of those baseline
standards is consistent with the Union’s legal framework and the objectives of the Green Deal.
(44) In the Green Deal the Commission committed itself to suppor t businesses and other stak eholders in developing
standardised natural capital accounting practices within the Union and internatio nally , with the aim of ensur ing
appropr iate management of environmental risks and mitig ation oppor tunities, and reduce related transaction costs.
The Transparent Project sponsored under the Programme for the Environment and Climate Action (LIFE
programme) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/783 of the European Parliament and of the Council (30)is
developing the first natural capital accounting methodology , which will make existing methods easier to compare
and more transparent while lower ing the threshold for companies to adopt and use the syste ms in suppor t of
future-proofing their business. The Natural Capital Protocol is also an impor tant referen ce in the field of natural
capital accounting. While natural capital accounting methods serve principally to strengthen internal management
decisions, they should be duly considered when establishing sustainability repor ting standards. Some natural capital
accounting methodologies seek to assign a monetar y value to the environmental impacts of companies’ activities,
which may help users of sustainability information to bette r understand such impacts. It is theref ore appropr iate
that sustainability repor ting standards should be able to include monetised indicators of sustainability impacts if
that is deemed necessar y.
(45) Sustainability repor ting standards should also take account of internati onally recognised principles and frameworks
on responsible business conduct, corporate social responsibility , and sustainable development, including the SDGs,
the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enter prises, the
OECD Due Dilig ence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct and relat ed sectoral guidelines, the Global
Com pact, the Intern ational Labour Org anization’s (ILO) Tripar tite Declaration of Principles concer ning
Multinational Enterpr ises and Social Policy , the ISO 26000 standard on social responsibility , and the UN Principles
for Responsible Investment.
