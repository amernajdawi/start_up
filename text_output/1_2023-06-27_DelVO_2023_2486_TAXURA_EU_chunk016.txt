ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 8/164(36) The four environmental objectives referred to in Article 9, points (c) to (f), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and in
Articles 12, 13, 14 and 15 of that Regulation are closely interlinked in terms of the means by which an objective is
achieved and the benefits that achieving one of the objectives may have on other objectives. The provisions
determining whether an economic activity contributes substantially to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, to the transition to a circular economy, to pollution prevention and control or to the
protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, are thus closely interrelated, and are closely linked to the
need to widen the disclosure obligations laid down in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178. To ensure coherence
between those provisions, which should enter into force at the same time, to facilitate a comprehensive view of the
legal framework for stakeholders and to facilitate the application of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, it is necessary to include those provisions in a single Regulation.
(37) To ensure that the application of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 evolves with scientific, technological, market and policy
developments, this Regulation should be regularly reviewed and, where appropriate, amended as regards the
activities considered to be contributing substantially to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine
resources, to the transition to a circular economy, to pollution prevention and control, to the protection and
restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, and the corresponding technical screening criteria.
(38) This Regulation is consistent with the climate-neutrality objective set out in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council (
23)and ensures progress on adaptation as referred
to in Article 5 of that Regulation. The Commission assessed the consistency of the technical screening criteria for
ensuring that economic activities that contribute substantially to one of the environmental objectives do not cause
significant harm to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation with the objective and targets of
Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 as required by Article 6(4) of that Regulation.
(39) It is necessary to provide non-financial and financial undertakings with sufficient time to assess whether their economic activities comply with the technical screening criteria laid down in this Regulation, and to report on the
basis of that assessment in accordance with Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178. The date of application of this
Regulation should therefore be deferred, while the amendments to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 should ensure that non-financial and financial undertakings have sufficient time to comply with their reporting
requirements under that Regulation,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

substantially to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources and for determining whether that

Regulation (EU) 2020/852 are set out in Annex I to this Regulation.
Article 2
Technical screening criteria related to the transition to a circular economy
The technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing
