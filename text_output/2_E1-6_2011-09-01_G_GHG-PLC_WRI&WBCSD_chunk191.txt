Malaysia due to rice production over the assessment
period. Assuming the GHG inventory is being assessed
in 2010 companies should also consider whether
any recent changes in land use in Malaysia may have
caused an increase in rice production over the past
two years not shown in the data.  If there is no reason 
to believe this is the case, the company can assume
that no land-use change impacts are attributable to
the studied product rice.
Taking the same approach for palm oil, it is obvious from
figure B.4 that there has been an increase in land used for
palm production over the assessment period.  
At this point a company can either assume that all the land
is converted from a different land category (e.g., forest,
grassland) to palm (see step 4), or they can estimate
what percentage of land is converted within the cropland
category and therefore not subject to land-use change. 3.   Determine what percentage of land-use change is 
due to converted cropland
Looking at the major crops dynamics in Malaysia over the
past 20 years, table B.2 shows a decrease in harvested
area for some crops and an increase in harvested area for
palm oil. This indicates that the total growth of harvested
area in the country is driven by increases in palm oil
production.
As table B.2 suggests, around 27 percent of the overall
land-use growth could potentially come from the
conversion of other cropland where area is decreasing.
Therefore the company may assume that 72 percent
of the palm oil produced in Malaysia comes from
areas converted from a different land category.  This 
assumption should not be made if the total area of
cropland is decreasing, or if the country has specific
efforts in place to convert degraded cropland to pasture
land or another type of land category. In these cases, the
decrease in other cropland may be due to those efforts
