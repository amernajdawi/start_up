The European Secur ities and Mark ets Author ity (ESMA), the European Banking Author ity (EBA) and the European
Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOP A) play a role in draf ting regulatory technical standards
pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 and there needs to be coherence between those regulator y technical
standards and sustainability repor ting standards. Under Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament
and of the Council (24), ESMA also plays a role in promoting super visor y convergence in the enforcement of
corporate repor ting by issuers whose secur ities are admitt ed to trading on a regulated market in the Union and who
will be required to repor t in accordance with those sustainability repor ting standards. Theref ore, ESMA, EBA and
EIOP A should be required to provide an opinion on EFRA G’s technical advice. Such opinions should be provid ed
within two months of the date of receipt of the request from the Commission. In addition, the Commission should
consult the European Environment Agen cy, the European Union Agen cy for Fundamental Rights, the ECB, the
Committ ee of European Auditing Oversight Bodies (CEA OB) and the Platf orm on Sustainable Finance to ensure that
the sustainability repor ting standards are coherent with relevant Union policy and law. Where any of those entities
decide to submit an opinion, they should do so within two months of the date of being consulted by the
Commission.
(40) In order to foste r democratic control, scrutiny and transparency , the Commission should, at least once a year, consult
the European Parliament, and jointly the Member State Exper t Group on Sustainable Finance and the Accounting
Regulat ory Committ ee on EFRA G’s work programme as regards the development of sustainability repor ting
standards.
(41) Sustainability repor ting standards should be coherent with other Union law. Those standards should in particular be
aligned with the disclosure requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, and they should take account of
underlying indicators and methodologies set out in the various delegat ed acts adopt ed pursuant to Regulation (EU)
2020/852, disclosure requirements applicable to benchmark administrator s pursuant to Regulation (EU)
2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (25), the minimum standards for the constr uction of EU
Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks, and of any work carried out by the EBA in the
imp lementation of the Pillar III disclosure requirements of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
Standards should take account of Union environmental law, including Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 of the
European Parliament and of the Council (26)and Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council (27), and should take account of Commission Recommendation 2013/179/EU (28), its annex es and their
update s. Other relevant Union law, including Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the
Council (29), and other requirements laid down in Union law for under takings as regar ds direct ors’ duties and due
dilig ence should also be taken into account.
