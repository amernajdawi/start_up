2.Action plan for contributing to nature conservation
2.1. The activity has developed and implemented an action plan specific to the tourism service or offer provided, which
defines how the activity can be carried out in a way which is compatible with and contributes to the implementation of the
management plan or equivalent instrument of the conservation area to which the activity intends to contribute. The plan
includes all of the following measures relevant for the conservation or restoration objectives of the area:
(a) a clear set of objectives and activities aimed at avoiding or minimising direct negative impacts on biodiversity, including
an analysis of the carrying capacity or limit of acceptable change (18)of the area developed by the organisation in charge
of the conservation or restoration of the area or by the operator of the activity in cooperation with that organisation (
19), including the following elements (20):
(i) for visits to natural sites: avoiding direct damage on ecosystems or habitats through management of tourist flows
and movements;
(ii) for wildlife interaction:
— avoiding direct harm and disturbance through detrimental actions such as animal feeding, destruction or
damaging eggs and nests, destruction or removal of plants or corals,
— avoiding indirect harm and disturbance on species from tourists’ local movements, such as littering, noise,
plastic, chemical or light pollution,
— prevention and avoidance of introduction of invasive alien species (21);
(iii) for wildlife harvesting and trade (22): protected wildlife species are not harvested, consumed, sold;
(18)The ‘carrying capacity’ is defined as the maximum number of people that may visit a tourist destination at the same time, without
causing destruction of the physical, economic, socio-cultural environment and an unacceptable decrease in the quality of visitors’
satisfaction (UNEP/MAP/PAP, 1997).
