The following aspects of the KPIs shall be disclosed:(a) in terms of stock, based on the total gross carrying amount of loans and advances as of the disclosure reference date;
(b) in terms of flow, based on the gross carrying amount of new loans and advances during the year prior to the disclosure
reference date;
(c) with a separate breakdown for enabling and for transitional and adaptation activities, and for specialised lending.

(2)(c) Debt securities to relevant entities financing taxonomy-aligned economic activities, including all debt securities

(2)(c)(1) represents debt securities where the use of proceeds is known;
(2)(c)(2) represents debt securities where the use of proceeds is not known.
