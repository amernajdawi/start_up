(9) The Union’ s and Member States’ climat e action aims to prote ct people and the planet, welfare, prosper ity, the
econom y, health, food systems, the integr ity of eco-systems and biodiversity against the threat of climate chang e, in
the cont ext of the Unit ed Nations 2030 agenda for sustainable development and in pursuit of the objectives of the
Paris Agreement, and to maximise prosper ity within the planetar y boundar ies and to increase resilience and reduce
vulnerability of society to climat e change. In light of this, the Union’s and Member States’ actions should be guided
by the precautionar y and ‘polluter pays’ principles established in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union, and should also take into account the ‘energy efficiency first ’ principle of the Energy Union and the ‘do no
harm’ principle of the European Green Deal.
(10) Achieving climate neutrality should require a contr ibution from all economic sector s for which emissions or
remo vals of greenhouse gases are regulated in Union law.
(11) In light of the impor tance of energy production and consump tion for the level of greenhouse gas emissions, it is
essential to ensure a transition to a safe, sustainable, affordable and secure energy system relying on the deplo yment
of renewables, a well-functioning intern al energy mark et and the improvement of energy efficiency , while reducing
energy poverty. Digital transf ormation, technological innovati on, and research and development are also important
drivers for achieving the climat e-neutrality objective.
(12) The Union has in place a regulator y framew ork to achieve the 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction targe t agreed
in 2014, before the entr y into force of the Paris Agreement. The legislation implementing that targe t consists, inter
alia, of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), whic h establishes the EU ETS,
Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), whic h introduced national targe ts for
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of
the Council (7), whic h requires Member States to balance greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use,
land use change and forestr y.
(13) The EU ETS is a cornerstone of the Union’s climat e policy and constitute s its key tool for reducing greenhouse gas
emissions in a cost-effe ctive way.
(14) The Commission has, in its communication of 28 November 2018 entitled ‘A Clean Planet for all – A European
strateg ic long-t erm vision for a prosperous, moder n, compe titive and climate-neutral economy’ , present ed a vision
for achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the Union by 2050 through a socially-fair and cost-efficient
transition.
(15) Through the ‘Clean Energy for All Europeans ’ packag e of 30 November 2016 the Union has been pursuing an
ambitious decarbonisation agenda , in particular by constr ucting a robust Energy Union, whic h includes the 2030
goals for energy efficiency and deplo yment of renewable energy in Directives 2012/27/EU (8)and (EU)
2018/2001 (9)of the European Parliament and of the Council, and by reinf orcing relevant legislation, including
Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (10).
(16) The Union is a global leader in the transition towards climate neutrality , and it is determined to help raise global
ambition and to strengthen the global response to climate change, using all tools at its disposal, including climate
diplomacy .
(5)Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a system for greenhouse gas
emission allowance trading within the Union and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32).
