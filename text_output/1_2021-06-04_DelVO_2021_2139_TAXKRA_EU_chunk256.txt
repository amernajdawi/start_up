(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  Greenhouse gas emissions (  127  ) from the cement production processes are: 
(a) for grey cement clinker, lower than 0,816 (  128  ) tCO  2 e per tonne of 
grey cement clinker;
(b) for cement from grey clinker or alternative hydraulic binder, lower
than 0,530 (  129  ) tCO  2 e per tonne of cement or alternative binder 
manufactured.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix C to this 
Annex.
Emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the latest relevant
best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including the best available
techniques (BAT) conclusions for the production of cement, lime and
magnesium oxide (  130  ). No significant cross-media effects occur (  131  ). 
For manufacture of cement employing hazardous wastes as alternative
fuels, measures are in place to ensure the safe handling of waste.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
3.8.  Manufacture of aluminium  
Description of the activity  
Manufacture of aluminium through primary alumina (bauxite) process or secondary aluminium recycling.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code C24.42, C24.53 in accordance with
the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.

establishing the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/447, determined on the basis of verified information on the
greenhouse gas efficiency of installations reported pursuant to Article 11 of Directive 2003/87/EC.  
( 129  ) Reflecting the median value of the installations in 2016 and 2017 (t CO  2 equivalents/t) of the data collected for grey cement clinker 
in the context of establishing the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/447, multiplied by the clinker to cement ratio
(0.65), determined on the basis of verified information on the greenhouse gas efficiency of installations reported pursuant to
Article 11 of Directive 2003/87/EC.  
( 130  ) Commission Implementing Decision 2013/163/EU of 26 March 2013 establishing the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions 
under Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on industrial emissions for the production of cement,
lime and magnesium oxide (OJ L 100, 9.4.2013, p. 1).
