biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
3.3.  Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport  
Description of the activity  
Manufacture, repair, maintenance, retrofitting (  88 ), repurposing and upgrade of low carbon transport vehicles, 
rolling stock and vessels, where the technology is one of the following:  
(a) trains, passenger coaches and wagons that have zero direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emissions;  
(b) trains, passenger coaches and wagons that have zero direct tailpipe CO  2 emission when operated on a track 
with necessary infrastructure, and use a conventional engine where such infrastructure is not available
(bimode);  
(c) urban, suburban and road passenger transport devices, where the direct (tailpipe) CO  2 emissions of the vehicles 
are zero;  
(d) until 31 December 2025, vehicles designated as categories M2 and M3 (  89 ) that have a type of bodywork 
classified as ‘CA’ (single-deck vehicle), ‘CB’ (double-deck vehicle), ‘CC’ (single-deck articulated vehicle) or ‘CD’
(double-deck articulated vehicle) (  90 ), and comply with the latest EURO VI standard, i.e. both with the 
requirements of Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 and, from the time of the entry into force of amendments
to that Regulation, in those amending acts, even before they become applicable, and with the latest step of the
Euro VI standard set out in Table 1 of Appendix 9 to Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 582/2011 where the
provisions governing that step have entered into force but have not yet become applicable for this type of
vehicle (  91 ). Where such standard is not available, the direct CO  2 emissions of the vehicles are zero;  
(e) personal mobility devices with a propulsion that comes from the physical activity of the user, from a zero-
emissions motor, or a mix of zero-emissions motor and physical activity;  
(f) vehicles of category M  1 and N  1 classified as light-duty vehicles (  92 ) with:  
(i) until 31 December 2025: specific emissions of CO  2 , as defined in Article 3(1), point (h), of Regulation (EU) 
2019/631, lower than 50 g CO  2 /km (low- and zero-emission light-duty vehicles);  
(ii) from 1 January 2026: specific emissions of CO  2 , as defined in Article 3(1), point (h), of Regulation (EU) 
2019/631, are zero;  
(g) vehicles of category L (  93 ) with tailpipe CO  2 emissions equal to 0g CO  2 e/km calculated in accordance with the 
emission test laid down in Regulation (EU) 168/2013;EN  L 442/180 Official Journal of the European Union 9.12.2021  
( 88 ) For points (j) to (m), the criteria related to retrofitting are covered in Sections 6.9 and 6.12 of this Annex.  
( 89 ) As referred to in Article 4(1), point (a), of Regulation (EU) 2018/858.  
( 90 ) As set out in point 3 of part C of Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2018/858.  
( 91 ) Until 31/12/2022, the EURO VI, step E as set out in Regulation (EC) No 595/2009.  
( 92 ) As defined in Article 4(1), points (a) and (b) of Regulation (EU) 2018/858.
