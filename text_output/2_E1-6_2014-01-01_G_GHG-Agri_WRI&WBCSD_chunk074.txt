Certain CO 2 fluxes should never be amortized
Irrespective of the quantification approach, certain CO 2 fluxes should never be amortized
and should always be reported in the year of the management pr actice. These are:  
 The CO 2 emissions from bioma ss and DOM combustion  
 The CO 2 emissions from the organic car bon stocks of organic soils.   

Amortizing the CO 2 emissions from DOM stocks is optional  
Some management practices ma y move C to DOM stocks that is not then emitted in the
year of the intervention. For inst ance, much of the C in biomass killed in a fire is added to
dead wood, litter and soil pools from where th e C will be emitted over years to decades,
as the DOM decomposes. Quantifying the emissions from these DOM stock changes can
be very challenging; for instance, DOM decay rates differ greatly between regions,
depending on temperature and moisture regimes. Consequently, companies may either assume that the total CO
2 emissions from DOM stocks occur in the year of the
intervention, or, should capacity and data ex ist, they may amortize these emissions over
time.   Table 8-2 summarizes when it is and is not appropriate to amortize CO
2 fluxes.

 Sequestration in woody biomass

 Sequestration in organic C stocks
of mineral soils  Amortize if the time interval of the
quantification approach exceeds one year
 Otherwise, report all the estimated
sequestration in the reporting period
Emissions from woody biomass
stocks Biomass combustion emissions should be
reported in the year of the intervention
Emissions from dead organic matter
(DOM) From the decomposition of DOM:
 Amortize, should capacity and data exist;
or
 Report in the year of intervention

From the combustion of DOM:
 Report in the year of intervention
Emissions from organic C stocks of
mineral soils  Amortize if the time interval of the
quantification approach exceeds one year
 Otherwise, report all the estimated
emissions in the year of the intervention
Emissions from organic soils Do not amortize – report losses as they occur
Sequestration in organic soils Do not amortize - report sequestration as it
occurs
