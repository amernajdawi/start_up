Companies should publicly report  the following information:  
 For non-mechanical sources: A description of whether the calculation methodologies
are IPCC Tier 1, 2, or 3, and a description of how those methodologies were chosen
based on the quality criteria in Chapter 7.3
 Scope 1 emissions disaggregated by m echanical sources, LUC (biogenic CO 2 only),
and all other non-mechanical sources   
 Net CO 2 flux data for the C stocks in above-ground and below-ground biomass,
DOM and soils (in tonnes CO 2), to the extent relevant and required, as defined in
Chapter 8.2
 Where LUC results in a reduction in the size of C stocks, the CO 2 emissions are
reported in Scope 1 (LUC is further defined in Box 9-1)
 Otherwise, all CO 2 fluxes are reported outside of th e scopes in a separate category
(‘Biogenic Carbon’) that ha s three components: (1) CO 2 fluxes (emissions or
removals) during land use management; (2 ) Sequestration during LUC; and (3) CO 2
emissions from biofuel combustion  
 A description of the methodology used (where relevant) to amortize the CO 2 fluxes
to/from C stocks  
 Assumptions regarding any use of proxy data in calculating the impacts of historical
changes in management on C stocks  
 Any exclusions of the impacts of histor ical management practices on C stocks  
Figure 9-1 summarizes how  GHG data should be separated within an inventory following 
these requirements and best practice recommendations.
