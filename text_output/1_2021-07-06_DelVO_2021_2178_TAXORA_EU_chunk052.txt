information provided by the counterparty on the project or activities to which the proceeds will be applied. Credit
institutions shall provide information on the type of economic activity that is funded. Double counting shall not be
allowed. Where the same specialised lending exposure is relevant for two environmental objectives, credit institutions shall
allocate it to the most relevant objective.
For the purposes of point (1)(c)(2), credit institutions shall rely on the CapEx and turnover KPI that the counterparty shall
disclose for each environmental objective in accordance with this Regulation. The amount of loans and advances to non-
financial undertakings shall be the sum of the gross carrying amount of the total loans and advances with unknown use of
proceeds to non-financial undertakings weighted by the proportion of taxonomy-aligned economic activities with a
breakdown for transition and enabling activities for each counterparty.
Credit institutions shall calculate the KPIs for those type of exposures as follows:
First step = (1)(b)/(1)(a).
