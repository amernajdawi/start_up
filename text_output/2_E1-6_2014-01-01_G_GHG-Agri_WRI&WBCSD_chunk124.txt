/ outputs and the GHG fluxes . For example , if mass is the main causal factor driving differences between products , allocations can be based on the mass of farm outputs : Allocated flux ൌ ൬Mass of specific product produced Total mass of all products produced൰ x Total flux

Alternatively, physical allocations  could be made based on the num ber or dietary quality of the 
products. The factor chosen should most accurate ly reflect the underlying physical relationship
between the products and GHG fluxes. For example,  if the mass of the outputs determines the 
amount of flux, choosing an energy content fact or would not provide the most accurate
allocation.
Economic allocation: Allocations are based on the market value of each product leaving the
process, as follows:

Allocated flux ൌ ൬Market Value of specific product produced
Total	market	value	of	all	products	produced൰	x	Total	flux  

The market value of co-product(s) should be th e value of the co-products as they leave the
common process (i.e. prior to any further proces sing). Also, if prices for the outputs vary over
the reporting period, it may be necessary to develop averages for the market values of the outputs
over this period.    Under either physical or economic allocati on, co-products without economic value are 
considered wastes and should have  no GHG fluxes allocated to them.
