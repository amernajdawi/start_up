(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  The direct GHG emissions of the activity are lower than 270 g CO  2 e/kWh.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  For the operation of high-enthalpy geothermal energy systems, adequate 
abatement systems are in place to reduce emission levels in order not to
hamper the achievement of air quality limit values set out in Directive
2004/107/EC and Directive 2008/50/EC.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
4.7.  Electricity generation from renewable non-fossil gaseous and liquid fuels  
Description of the activity  
Construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity using gaseous and liquid fuels
of renewable origin. This activity does not include electricity generation from the exclusive use of biogas and bio-
liquid fuels (see Section 4.8 of this Annex).  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular D35.11 and
F42.22 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC)
No 1893/2006.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that
substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.
2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in
Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the
following steps:
(a) screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in
Appendix A to this Annex may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;
(b) where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A
to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks
on the economic activity;
(c) an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.EN  9.12.2021 Official Journal of the European Union L 442/225
