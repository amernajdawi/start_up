IPCC guidelines to ensure accurate and up-to-date accounting
of land use and land-use change emissions.  However, it is 
important to note that while the IPCC guidelines have useful and
comprehensive information, their focus is on national inventories
and therefore some details are not applicable.2 It is recognized that a change in carbon stock can result in either a
removal or emission of carbon from or to the atmosphere. However,
because this standard accounts for the GHG inventory of a product,
it is more likely that the use of biomass (and not the planting or
re-growth of biomass) will results in GHG emissions than removals.
Growing biomass to create a GHG credit is not attributable to a
product following this standard methodology. However in some
cases, such as a carbon stock change from till to no-till crop rotation)
or use of degraded lands, a company may see a net positive land-use
change impact (e.g., more removal than emissions).
3 This refers only to biomass burning, liming, and other practices
used to prepare converted land.  Biomass burning and fertilizer 
application due to agricultural and forestry practices are also
included in the inventory as attributable processes, separate from
land-use change impacts.

6 The 2006 IPCC guidelines give values for forest land above and
below a certain density of biomass. If the removal of biomass does
not cause a change in carbon stock value, then land-use change
impacts may be calculated as zero.
