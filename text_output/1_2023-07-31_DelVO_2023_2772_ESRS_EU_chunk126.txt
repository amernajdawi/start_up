Application Requirements
This appendix is an integral part of the ESRS E3. It supports the application of the disclosure requirements set out in this
standard and has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard.
ESRS 2 GENERAL DISCLOSURES
Impact, risk and opportunity management
Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 IRO-1 – Description of the processes to identify and assess material water
and marine resources-related impacts, risks and opportunities
AR 1. When conducting a materiality assessment on environmental subtopics, the undertaking shall assess the
materiality of water and marine resources in its own operations and its upstream and downstream value chain,
and may consider the four phases below, also known as the LEAP approach:
(a) Phase 1: locate where in its own operations and along the value chain the interface with nature takes place;
(b) Phase 2: evaluate the dependencies and impacts;
(c) Phase 3: assess the material risks and opportunities; and
(d) Phase 4: prepare and report the results of the materiality assessment.
AR 2. The materiality assessment for ESRS E3 corresponds to the first three phases of this LEAP approach, the fourth
phase addresses the outcome of the process.
AR 3. The processes to assess the materiality of impacts, risks and opportunities shall consider the provisions in ESRS 2
IRO-1 Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities, and IRO-2 Disclosure
Requirements in ESRS covered by the undertaking’s sustainability statement.
AR 4. The sub-topics related to water and marine resources covered by the materiality assessment include:
(a) water, which encompasses the consumption of surface water , groundwater , as well as withdrawals and
discharges of water; and
(b) marine resources, which encompasses the extraction and use of such resources and associated economic activities.
AR 5. In phase 1, to locate where there are areas at water risk, and areas where there is an interface with marine resources
that could lead to material impacts and dependencies in its own operations and along its upstream and
downstream value chain, the undertaking may consider:
(a) the locations of direct assets and operations and related upstream and downstream activities across the value
chain;
(b) the sites located in areas at water risk , including areas of high-water stress; and
(c) the sectors or business units that are interfacing with water or marine resources in these priority locations.
AR 6. The undertaking shall consider river basins as the relevant level for assessment of locations and combine that
approach with an operational risk assessment of its facilities and the facilities of suppliers with material impacts
and risks.
AR 7. The undertaking shall consider the criteria for defining the status of water bodies according to the relevant
Annexes of Directive 2000/60/EC (Water Framework Directive) as well as the guidance documents provided for
implementation of the Water Framework Directive. The list of guidance documents can be accessed under the
European Commission’s Environment home page.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
