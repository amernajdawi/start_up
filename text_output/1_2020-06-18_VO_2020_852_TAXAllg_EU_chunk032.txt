(55) This Regulation supplements the disclosure requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. To ensure the
orderly and effective monit oring of compl iance by financial mark et participants with this Regulation, Member
State s should rely on the compe tent author ities designat ed in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. To
enforce compl iance, Member States should in addition lay down rules on measures and penalties, which should be
effective, propor tionate and dissuasive. National compet ent author ities and the ESAs should exercise the product
inter vention powers laid down in Regulations (EU) No 600/2014 (65), (EU) No 1286/2014 (66) and (EU)
2019/1238 (67) of the European Parliament and of the Council also with respect to mis-selling practices or
misleading disclosures of sustainability-related information, including the information required under this
Regulation.
(56) In order to ensure the efficient and sustainable organisati on of the work and meeting practices of both the Platf orm
and the Member State Exper t Group on Sustainable Finance, and in order to enable broad participation and efficient
inter action within the groups, their subgroups, the Commission and stakeholders, the increased use of digital,
including virtual, technologies should be considered, where appropr iate.
(57) To give sufficient time to the relevant actors to familiar ise themselves with the criteria for qualif ication as
environmentally sustainable economic activities set out in this Regulation and to prepare for their application, the
oblig ations set out in this Regulation should become applicable, for each environmental objective, 12 months after
the relevant technical screening criteria have been established.
(58) The provision in this Regulation refer ring to certificate-based tax incentive schemes that exist prior to the entr y into
force of this Regulation is without prejudice to the respective compet ences of the Union and the Member States with
respect to tax provi sions, as set out by the Treaties.
(59) The application of this Regulation should be reviewed regularly in order to assess, inter alia: the progress with regar d
to the development of technical screening criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities; the possible
need to revise and compl ement those criteria for deter mining whether an economic activity qualifi es as
environmentally sustainable; the effectiveness of the classificat ion system for environmentally sustainable economic
activities in channelling private investment into such activities and in particular as regar ds the flow of capital into
private enterprises and other legal entities; and the further development of that classificat ion system, including by
expanding its scope beyond environmentally sustainable economic activities, in order to cover activities that
signif icantly harm the environment, as well as other sustainability objectives, including social objectives.
(60) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be suffi ciently achi eved by the Member States, but can rather , by
reason of the need to introduce at Union level unif orm criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities,
be better achi eved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiar ity as
set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of propor tionality as set out in
that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessar y in order to achieve those objectives,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGUL ATION:
