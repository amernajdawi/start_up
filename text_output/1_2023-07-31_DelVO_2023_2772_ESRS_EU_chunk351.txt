ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 151/284AR 35. The undertaking may disclose, for example, land cover change, which is the physical representation of the drivers
“habitat modification” and “industrial and domestic activities”, i.e., the man-made or natural change of the
physical properties of the earth’s surface at a specific location.
AR 36. Land cover is a typical variable that can be assessed with earth observation data.
AR 37. When reporting on material impacts related to the ecosystems , the undertaking may, in addition to the extent and
condition of ecosystems, also consider the functioning of ecosystems by using:
(a) a metric that measures a process or function that the ecosystem completes, or that reflects the ability of the
ecosystem to undertake that specific process or function: e.g. net primary productivity, which is a measure of
plant productivity based on the rate at which energy is stored by plants and made available to other species in
the ecosystem. It is a core process that occurs for ecosystems to function. It is related to many factors, such as
species diversity, but does not measure these factors directly; or
(b) A metric that measures changes to the population of scientifically identified species under threat.
AR 38. At the ecosystem level, data layers reflecting change in the extent and condition of ecosystems may be applied,
including levels of habitat fragmentation and connectivity.
Disclosure Requirement E4-6 – Anticipated financial effects from material biodiversity and ecosystem-related risks and opportunities
AR 39. The undertaking may include an assessment of its related products and services at risk over the short-, medium-
and long-term, explaining how these are defined, how financial amounts are estimated, and which critical
assumptions are made.
AR 40. The quantification of the anticipated financial effects in monetary terms under paragraph 45(a) may be a single
amount or a range.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
