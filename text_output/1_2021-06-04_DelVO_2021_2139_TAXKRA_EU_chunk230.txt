(c) the management system in place shows compliance with the forest
sustainability criteria as defined in Article 29(6) of Directive (EU)
2018/2001, and as of the date of its application with the imple ­
menting act on operational guidance for energy from forest biomass
adopted under Article 29(8) of that Directive.
1.5. The activity does not involve the degradation of land with high
carbon stock (  63 ). 
1.6. The management system associated with the activity in place
complies with the due diligence obligation and legality requirements laid
down in Regulation (EU) No 995/2010.
1.7. The forest management plan or equivalent instrument provides for
monitoring which ensures the correctness of the information contained in
the plan, in particular as regards the data relating to the involved area.
2. Audit  
Within two years after the beginning of the activity and every 10 years
thereafter, the compliance of the activity with the substantial contribution
to climate change mitigation criteria and the DNSH criteria are verified by
either of the following:
(a) the relevant national competent authorities;
(b) an independent third-party certifier, at the request of national
authorities or the operator of the activity.
In order to reduce costs, audits may be performed together with any forest
certification, climate certification or other audit.
The independent third-party certifier may not have any conflict of interest
with the owner or the funder, and may not be involved in the devel ­
opment or operation of the activity.
3. Group assessment  
The compliance with the DNSH criteria may be checked:
(a) at the level of the forest sourcing area (  64 ) as defined by Directive (EU) 
2018/2001;
(b) at the level of a group of holdings sufficiently homogeneous to
evaluate the risk of the sustainability of the forest activity, provided
that all those holdings have a durable relationship between them and
participate in the activity and the group of those holdings remains the
same for all subsequent audits.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.
Detailed information referred to in point 1.2. (i) includes provisions to
comply with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.

( 63 ) Land with high-carbon stock means wetlands, including peatland, and continuously forested areas within the meaning of
Article 29(4)(a), (b) and (c) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.
( 64 ) ‘Sourcing area’ means the geographically defined area from which the forest biomass feedstock is sourced, from which reliable  and 
independent information is available and where conditions are sufficiently homogeneous to evaluate the risk of the sustainabili ty
and legality characteristics of the forest biomass.EN  9.12.2021 Official Journal of the European Union L 442/171
