convention applies to: “(a) tribal peoples in independent countries whose social,
cultural and economic conditions distinguish them from other sections of the national community, and whose status is regulated wholly or partially by their own
customs or traditions or by special laws or regulations; (b) peoples in independent
countries who are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent from the
populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the
country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonisation or the establishment of
present state boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or
all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions”. ILO
Convention 169 also states in Article 1(2) that: “[s]elf-identification as
indigenous or tribal shall be regarded as a fundamental criterion for determining the groups to which the provisions of this Convention apply”.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
