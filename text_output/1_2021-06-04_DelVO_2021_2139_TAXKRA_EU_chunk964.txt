 Appendix B  
GENERIC CRITERIA FOR DNSH TO SUSTAINABLE USE AND PROTECTION OF WATER AND MARINE
RESOURCES  
Environmental degradation risks related to preserving water quality and avoiding water stress are identified and
addressed with the aim of achieving good water status and good ecological potential as defined in Article 2,
points (22) and (23), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC (  1 ) and a water use 
and protection management plan, developed thereunder for the potentially affected water body or bodies, in
consultation with relevant stakeholders.  
Where an Environmental Impact Assessment is carried out in accordance with Directive 2011/92/EU and includes an
assessment of the impact on water in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC, no additional assessment of impact on
water is required, provided the risks identified have been addressed.EN  9.12.2021 Official Journal of the European Union L 442/347  
( 1 ) For activities in third countries, in accordance with applicable national law or international standards which pursue equival ent
objectives of good water status and good ecological potential, through equivalent procedural and substantive rules, i.e. a wate r
use and protection management plan developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders which ensures that 1) the impact of the  
activities on the identified status or ecological potential of potentially affected water body or bodies is assessed and 2) det erioration or
prevention of good status/ecological potential is avoided or, where this is not possible, 3) justified by the lack of better en vironmental
alternatives which are not disproportionately costly/technically unfeasible, and all practicable steps are taken to mitigate th e adverse
impact on the status of the body of water.
