Generic criteria for DNSH to protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems
An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or screening (1)has been completed in accordance with
Directive 2011/92/EU (2).
Where an EIA has been carried out, the required mitigation and compensation measures for protecting the
environment are implemented.
For sites/operations located in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas (including the Natura 2000 network of protected
areas, UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas, as well as other protected areas), an appropriate
assessment (3), where applicable, has been conducted and based on its conclusions the necessary mitigation
measures (4)are implemented.
(1)The procedure through which the competent authority determines whether projects listed in Annex II to Directive 2011/92/EU is to be
made subject to an environmental impact assessment (as referred to in Article 4(2) of that Directive).
