Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  GHG emissions (  195  ) from the organic chemicals production processes are 
lower than:
(a) for HVC: [0,851 (  196  )] tCO  2 e/t of HVC; 
(b) for aromatics: 0,0300 (  197  ) tCO  2 e/t of complex weighted throughput; 
(c) for vinyl chloride: [0,268 (  198  ) tCO  2 e/t of vinyl chloride; 
(d) for styrene: 0,564 (  199  ) tCO  2 e/t of styrene; 
(e) for ethylene oxide/ethylene glycols: 0,489 (  200  ) tCO  2 e/t of ethylene 
oxide/glycol;
(f) for adipic acid: 0,76 (  201  ) tCO  2 e/t of adipic acid. 
Where the organic chemicals in scope are produced wholly or partially
from renewable feedstock, the life-cycle GHG emissions of the manu ­
factured chemical, manufactured wholly or partially from renewable feed ­
stock, are lower than the life-cycle GHG emissions of the equivalent
chemical manufactured from fossil fuel feedstock
Agricultural biomass used for the manufacture of organic basic chemicals
in its primary form complies with the criteria laid down in Article 29,
paragraphs 2 to 5, of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Forest biomass used for
the manufacture of organic basic chemicals complies with the criteria laid
down in Article 29, paragraphs 6 and 7, of that Directive.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix C to this 
Annex.
Emissions are within or lower than the emission levels associated with the
best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in relevant best
available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including:
(a) the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for the production of
large volumes organic chemicals (  202  );

( 195  ) Calculated in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/331. 
( 196  ) Reflecting the median value of the installations in 2016 and 2017 (t CO  2 equivalents/t) of the data collected in the context of 
establishing the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/447, determined on the basis of verified information on the
greenhouse gas efficiency of installations reported pursuant to Article 11 of Directive 2003/87/EC.
