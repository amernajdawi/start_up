9.  PROFESSIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL ACTIVITIES  
9.1.  Engineering activities and related technical consultancy dedicated to adaptation to climate change  
Description of the activity  
Engineering activities and related technical consultancy dedicated to adaptation to climate change.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code M71.12 in accordance with the
statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/20061.  
An economic activity in this category is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation
(EU) 2020/852 where it meets the technical screening criteria specified this section  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
The economic activity is predominantly aimed at the provision of consultancy that helps one or more economic
activities for which the technical screening criteria have been set out in this Annex to meet those respective criteria
for substantial contribution to climate change adaptation, while respecting the relevant criteria for doing no
significant harm to other environmental objectives.
The economic activity complies with one the following criteria:
(a) it uses state-of-the-art modelling techniques that:
(i) properly reflect climate change risks;
(ii) do not rely only on historical trends;
(iii) integrate forward-looking scenarios;
(b) it develops climate models and projections, services and assessment of impacts, the best available science for
vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies line with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change reports and scientific peer-reviewed publications.
The economic activity removes information, financial, technological and capacity barriers to adaptation.
The potential to reduce material impacts due to climate risks is mapped through a robust climate risk assessment
in the target economic activity.
Activities in architectural design take into account climate proofing guidelines, climate-related hazards modelling
and enable the adaptation of construction and infrastructure, including building codes and integrated management
systems.
The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people,
of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  636  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  637  ) to the extent possible;  
_____________
( 636  ) Nature-based solutions are defined as ‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simulta neously 
provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse,
nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient an d
systemic interventions’. Therefore, nature-based solutions benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosyste m
services (version of 4.6.2021: https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/nature-based-solutio ns_
en/).
