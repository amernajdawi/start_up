ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2772/oj 73/284— Disclosure Requirement E1-8 – Internal carbon pricing
— Disclosure Requirement E1-9 – Anticipated financial effects from material physical and transition risks and
potential climate-related opportunities
Objective
1. The objective of this Standard is to specify Disclosure Requirements which will enable users of sustainability
statements to understand:
(a) how the undertaking affects climate change, in terms of material positive and negative actual and potential
impacts;
(b) the undertaking’s past, current, and future mitigation efforts in line with the Paris Agreement (or an updated international agreement on climate change) and compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5°C;
(c) the plans and capacity of the undertaking to adapt its strategy and business model, in line with the transition to a sustainable economy and to contribute to limiting global warming to 1.5°C;
(d) any other actions taken by the undertaking, and the result of such actions to prevent, mitigate or remediate actual
or potential negative impacts, and to address risks and opportunities
;
(e) the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on climate change, and how the undertaking manages them; and
(f) the financial effects on the undertaking over the short-, medium- and long-term of risks and opportunities
arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies on climate change.
2. The Disclosure Requirements of this Standard take into account the requirements of related EU legislation and regulation (i.e., EU Climate Law (
23), Climate Benchmark Standards Regulation (24), Sustainable Finance Disclosure
Regulation (SFDR) (25), EU Taxonomy (26), and EBA Pillar 3 disclosure requirements (27)).
3. This Standard covers Disclosure Requirements related to the following sustainability matters: “Climate change
mitigation” and “Climate change adaptation”. It also covers energy-related matters, to the extent that they are
relevant to climate change.
4. Climate change mitigation relates to the undertaking’s endeavours to the general process of limiting the increase in
the global average temperature to 1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels in line with the Paris Agreement. This Standard
covers disclosure requirements related but not limited to the seven Greenhouse gases (GHG) carbon dioxide (CO2),
methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). It also covers Disclosure Requirements on how the undertaking addresses its
GHG emissions as well as the associated transition risks.
