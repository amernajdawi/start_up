4. Choose the target base year
For a target to be credible, it has to be transparent how
target emissions are defined in relation to past emissions.Two general approaches are available: a fixed target baseyear or a rolling target base year.
USING A FIXED TARGET BASE YEAR. Most GHG
targets are defined as a percentage reduction in emis-sions below a fixed target base year (e.g., reduce CO
2
emissions 25 percent below 1994 levels by 2010).Chapter 5 describes how companies should track emis-sions in their inventory over time in reference to afixed base year. Although it is possible to use differentyears for the inventory base year and the target baseyear, to streamline the inventory and target reportingprocess, it usually makes sense to use the same yearfor both. As with the inventory base year, it is impor-tant to ensure that the emissions data for the targetbase year are reliable and verifiable. It is possible touse a multi-year average target base year. The sameconsiderations as described for multi-year average
base years in chapter 5 apply.
Chapter 5 provides standards on when and how to
recalculate base year emissions in order to ensurelike-with-like comparisons over time when structuralchanges (e.g., acquisitions/divestitures) or changes inmeasurement and calculation methodologies alter theemissions profile over time. In most cases, this willalso be an appropriate approach for recalculating datafor a fixed target base year.
USING A ROLLING TARGET BASE YEAR. Companies
may consider using a rolling target base year ifobtaining and maintaining reliable and verifiable datafor a fixed target base year is likely to be challenging(for example, due to frequent acquisitions). With arolling target base year, the base year rolls forward atregular time intervals, usually one year, so that emis-sions are always compared against the previous year.
