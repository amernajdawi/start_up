from scope 3. Company E reports indirect emissions
associated with the consumption of electricity purchasedfrom the company D’s co-generation unit under scope 2.
For more guidance, see Appendix A on accounting for
indirect emissions from purchased electricity.
Scope 3: Other indirect GHG emissions
Scope 3 is optional, but it provides an opportunity to beinnovative in GHG management. Companies may want tofocus on accounting for and reporting those activities thatare relevant to their business and goals, and for which theyhave reliable information. Since companies have discretionover which categories they choose to report, scope 3 maynot lend itself well to comparisons across companies. Thissection provides an indicative list of scope 3 categoriesand includes case studies on some of the categories.
Some of these activities will be included under scope 1 if the
pertinent emission sources are owned or controlled by thecompany (e.g., if the transportation of products is done invehicles owned or controlled by the company). To determineif an activity falls within scope 1 or scope 3, the companyshould refer to the selected consolidation approach (equityor control) used in setting its organizational boundaries.
Extraction and production of purchased materials

Transport-related activities
Transportation of purchased materials or goods
Transportation of purchased fuels
Employee business travel
Employees commuting to and from work
Transportation of sold products
Transportation of waste Electricity-related activities not included in scope 2
(see Appendix A)
Extraction, production, and transportation of fuels
consumed in the generation of electricity (either
purchased or own generated by the reporting company)
Purchase of electricity that is sold to an end user
(reported by utility company)
Generation of electricity that is consumed in a T&Dsystem (reported by end-user)
Leased assets, franchises, and outsourced activities—
emissions from such contractual arrangements areonly classified as scope 3 if the selected consolidationapproach (equity or control) does not apply to them.Clarification on the classification of leased assetsshould be obtained from the company accountant (seesection on leases below).
Use of sold products and services
Waste disposal
Disposal of waste generated in operations
Disposal of waste generated in the production of
purchased materials and fuels
Disposal of sold products at the end of their life
ACCOUNTING FOR SCOPE 3 EMISSIONS
Accounting for scope 3 emissions need not involve afull-blown GHG life cycle analysis of all products andoperations. Usually it is valuable to focus on one or twomajor GHG-generating activities. Although it is diffi-cult to provide generic guidance on which scope 3emissions to include in an inventory, some general stepscan be articulated: CHAPTER 4 Setting Operational Boundaries 29GUIDANCE
