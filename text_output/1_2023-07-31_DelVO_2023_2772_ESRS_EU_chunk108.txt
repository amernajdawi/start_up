ii. the number of allowances to be purchased in the market yearly, i.e., before and until 2030;
iii. the gap between estimated future emissions under various transition scenarios and free allocations of
allowances that are known for the period until 2030, and
iv. the estimated yearly cost per tonne of CO2 for which an allowance needs to be purchased;
(c) In assessing its potential future liabilities, the undertaking may consider and disclose the number of Scope 1
GHG emission allowances within regulated emission trading schemes and the cumulative number of emission
allowances stored (from previous allowances) at the beginning of the reporting period;
(d) undertakings disclosing volumes of carbon credits planned to be cancelled in the near future (Disclosure
Requirement E1-7) may disclose the potential future liabilities associated with those based on existing
contractual agreements;
(e) the undertaking may also include its monetised gross Scope 1, 2 and total GHG emissions (in monetary units)
calculated as follows:
i. monetised Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in the reporting year by the following formula:
(a)
ii. monetised total GHG emissions in the reporting year by the following formula:
(b)
iii. by use of a lower, middle and upper cost rate (56)for GHG emissions (e.g., market carbon price and
different estimates for the societal costs of carbon) and reasons for selecting them.
AR 75. Other approaches and methodologies may be applied to assess how transition risks may affect the future financial
position of the undertaking. In any case, the disclosure of anticipated financial effects shall include a description
of the methodologies and definitions used by the undertaking.
AR 76. When preparing the information required under paragraph 67 (e), the undertaking may assess and disclose the
share of net revenue from business activities at transition risks
. This disclosure:
(a) shall be based on the net revenue in line with the requirements in accounting standards applied for financial
statements, i.e., IFRS 15 or local GAAP.
(b) may include a breakdown of the undertakingâ€™s business activities with the corresponding details of the associated percentage of current net revenue, risk factors (events and exposure), and when possible, the
anticipated financial effects related to margin erosion over the short-, medium- and long-term. The nature of
business activities may also be disaggregated by operating segments if the undertaking has disclosed the
contribution of margins by operational segments in its segment reporting in the financial statements.
(56)The cost rate is the factor used to convert non-monetary impacts like tonnes, hectares, m3 etc. into monetary units. Cost rates should
be based on monetary valuation studies, need to be science-based and the methods used to obtain them transparent. Guidance on
these methods can be obtained, e.g., from the EU-LIFE-funded TRANSPARENT project.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
