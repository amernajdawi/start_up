‘Where credit institutions have a business model based to a great extent on financing public housing, they shall
disclose a KPI concerning the proportion of exposures to public authorities financing activities in compliance
with the relevant technical screening criteria, in particular, in accordance with Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5,

Annex II to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486. This GAR shall be estimated and disclosed by the credit
institution as a proportion of loan or debt securities exposures to municipalities financing public housing
compliant with the relevant technical screening criteria, in particular, in accordance with Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3,
7.4, 7.5, 7.6 and 7.7 of Annex I or Annex II to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 or Sections 3.1 and 3.2

‘For the financing of other activities and assets than public housing where the use of proceeds is known, credit
institutions shall consider the gross carrying amount of those exposures, including specialised lending
exposures, to the public authority to the extent and proportion that the lending finances a Taxonomy-aligned
economic activity. The assessment of whether that requirement has been met shall be based on information
provided by the public authority on the project or activities to which the proceeds will be applied. Credit
institutions shall provide information on the type of economic activity that is funded. Double counting shall
not be allowed. Where the same specialised lending exposure is relevant for two environmental objectives,
credit institutions shall allocate it to the most relevant objective.’;

exposures of the exposure-based KPIs:
(a) total GAR for financing activities directed at financial undertakings, for all the environmental objectives;
(b) total GAR for financing activities directed at non-financial undertakings, for all the environmental
objectives;
(c) GAR for residential real estate exposures, including house renovation loans, for the objectives of climate
change mitigation, climate change adaptation, and circular economy;
(d) GAR for retail car loans, for the objective of climate change mitigation;
(e) GAR for use of proceeds financing local governments, for all the environmental objectives;
(f) GAR for commercial and residential repossessed real estate collateral held for sale, for climate change
objectives.
Together with the total GAR, credit institutions shall disclose the percentage of assets that are excluded
