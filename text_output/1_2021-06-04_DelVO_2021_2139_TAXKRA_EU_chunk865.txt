(b) for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state-of-the-art
climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios (  566  ) consistent with the expected lifetime 
of the activity, including, at least, 10 to 30 year climate projections scenarios for major investments.
3. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and
take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line
with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports (  567  ), scientific peer-reviewed 
publications and open source (  568  ) or paying models. 
4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people,
of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  569  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  570  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  The building is not dedicated to extraction, storage, transport or manu ­
facture of fossil fuels.
The Primary Energy Demand (PED) (  571  ) setting out the energy 
performance of the building resulting from the construction does not
exceed the threshold set for the nearly zero-energy building (NZEB)
requirements in national regulation implementing Directive 2010/31/EU.
The energy performance is certified using an as built Energy Performance
Certificate (EPC).  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  Where installed, except for installations in residential building units, the 
specified water use for the following water appliances are attested by
product datasheets, a building certification or an existing product label
in the Union, in accordance with the technical specifications laid down
in Appendix E to Annex I to this Regulation:
(a) wash hand basin taps and kitchen taps have a maximum water flow of
6 litres/min;
(b) showers have a maximum water flow of 8 litres/min;
