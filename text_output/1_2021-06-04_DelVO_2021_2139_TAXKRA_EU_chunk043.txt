1.  FORESTRY  
1.1.  Afforestation  
Description of the activity  
Establishment of forest through planting, deliberate seeding or natural regeneration on land that, until then, was
under a different land use or not used. Afforestation implies a transformation of land use from non-forest to
forest, in accordance with the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (‘FAO’) definition of
afforestation (  1 ), where forest means a land matching the forest definition as set out in national law, or where not 
available, is in accordance with the FAO definition of forest (  2 ). Afforestation may cover past afforestation as long 
as it takes place in the period between the planting of the trees and the time when the land use is recognised as a
forest.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code A2 in accordance with the statistical
classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006. The economic activities in this
category are limited to NACE II 02.10, i.e. silviculture and other forestry activities, 02.20, i.e. logging, 02.30,
i.e. gathering of wild growing non-wood products and 02.40, i.e. support services to forestry.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. Afforestation plan and subsequent forest management plan or equivalent instrument  
1.1. The area on which the activity takes place is covered by an afforestation plan of a duration of at least five
years, or the minimum period prescribed in national law, developed prior to the start of the activity and
continuously updated, until this area matches the definition of forest as set out in national law or where not
available, is in line with the FAO definition of forest.
The afforestation plan contains all elements required by the national law relating to environmental impact
assessment of afforestation.
1.2. Preferably through the afforestation plan, or if information is missing, through any other document,
detailed information is provided on the following points:
(a) description of the area according to its gazetting in the land registry;
(b) site preparation and its impacts on pre-existing carbon stocks, including soils and above-ground biomass, in
order to protect land with high carbon stock (  3 ); 
(c) management goals, including major constraints;
(d) general strategies and activities planned to reach the management goals, including expected operations over
the whole forest cycle;
(e) definition of the forest habitat context, including main existing and intended forest tree species, and their
extent and distribution;
(f) compartments, roads, rights of way and other public access, physical features including waterways, areas
under legal and other restrictions;
(g) measures deployed to establish and maintain the good condition of forest ecosystems;
(h) consideration of societal issues (including preservation of landscape, consultation of stakeholders in
accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in national law);
