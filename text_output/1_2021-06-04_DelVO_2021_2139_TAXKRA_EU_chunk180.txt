At its end of life, the equipment undergoes preparation for reuse, recovery
or recycling operations, or proper treatment, including the removal of all
fluids and a selective treatment in accordance with Annex VII to Directive
2012/19/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (  310  ).

8.2.  Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions  
Description of the activity  
Development or use of ICT solutions that are aimed at collecting, transmitting, storing data and at its modelling
and use where those activities are predominantly aimed at the provision of data and analytics enabling GHG
emission reductions. Such ICT solutions may include,  inter alia , the use of decentralized technologies 
(i.e. distributed ledger technologies), Internet of Things (IoT), 5G and Artificial Intelligence. The economic activities
in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular J61, J62 and J63.11 in accordance with
the statistical classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 10(1), point (i), of Regulation
(EU) 2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. The ICT solutions are predominantly used for the provision of data and analytics enabling GHG emission
reductions.
2. Where an alternative solution/technology is already available on the market, the ICT solution demonstrates
substantial life-cycle GHG emission savings compared to the best performing alternative solution/technology.
Life-cycle GHG emissions and net emissions are calculated using Recommendation 2013/179/EU or, alter ­
natively, using ETSI ES 203 199 (  311  ), ISO 14067:2018 (  312  ) or ISO 14064-2:2019 (  313  ). 
Quantified life-cycle GHG emission reductions are verified by an independent third party which transparently
assesses how the standard criteria, including those for critical review, have been followed when the value was
derived.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.
