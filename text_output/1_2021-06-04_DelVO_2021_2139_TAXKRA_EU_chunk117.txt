(f) installation of equipment such as, but not limited to future smart metering systems or those replacing smart
metering systems in line with Article 19(6) of Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of
the Council (  180  ), which meet the requirements of Article 20 of Directive (EU) 2019/944, able to carry 
information to users for remotely acting on consumption, including customer data hubs;
(g) construction/installation of equipment to allow for exchange of specifically renewable electricity between
users;
(h) construction and operation of interconnectors between transmission systems, provided that one of the
systems is compliant.
For the purposes of this Section, the following specifications apply:
(a) the rolling five-year period used in determining compliance with the thresholds is based on five consecutive
historical years, including the year for which the most recent data are available;
(b) a ‘system’ means the power control area of the transmission or distribution network where the infrastructure
or equipment is installed;
(c) transmission systems may include generation capacity connected to subordinated distribution systems;
(d) distribution systems subordinated to a transmission system that is deemed to be on a trajectory to full
decarbonisation may also be deemed to be on a trajectory to full decarbonisation;
(e) to determine compliance, it is possible to consider a system covering multiple control areas which are
interconnected and with significant energy exchanges between them, in which case the weighted average
emissions factor across all included control areas is used, and individual subordinated transmission or
distribution systems within that system is not required to demonstrate compliance separately;
(f) it is possible for a system to become non-compliant after having previously been compliant. In systems that
become non-compliant, no new transmission and distribution activities are compliant from that moment
onward, until the system complies again with the threshold (except for those activities that are always
compliant, see above). Activities in subordinated systems may still be compliant, where those subordinated
systems meet the criteria of this Section;
(g) a direct connection or expansion of an existing direct connection to production plants includes infrastructure
that is indispensable to carry the associated electricity from the power generating facility to a substation or to
the network.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  N/A  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  A waste management plan is in place and ensures maximal reuse or 
recycling at end of life in accordance with the waste hierarchy,
including through contractual agreements with waste management
partners, reflection in financial projections or official project documen ­
tation.
