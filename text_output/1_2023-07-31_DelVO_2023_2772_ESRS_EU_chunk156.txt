Application Requirements
This appendix is an integral part of the ESRS E5. It supports the application of the disclosure requirements set out in this
standard and has the same authority as the other parts of the standard.
ESRS 2 GENERAL DISCLOSURES
Impact, risk and opportunity management
Disclosure requirement related to ESRS 2 IRO-1 – Description of the processes to identify and assess material resource
use and circular economy-related impacts, risks and opportunities
AR 1. When conducting a materiality assessment on environmental subtopics, the undertaking shall assess the
materiality of resource use and circular economy in its own operations and its upstream and downstream value
chain, and may consider the four phases below, also known as the LEAP approach:
(a) Phase 1: locate where in the undertaking’s own operations and along its upstream and downstream value
chain the interface with nature takes place;
(b) Phase 2: evaluate the dependencies and impacts;
(c) Phase 3: assess the material risks and opportunities;
(d) Phase 4: prepare and report the results of the materiality assessment.
AR 2. With regard to ESRS E5, phases 1 and 2 rely mainly on the materiality assessments conducted under ESRS E1
(including energy consumption), ESRS E2 (pollution), ESRS E3 (marine resources, water consumption) and ESRS
E4 (biodiversity, ecosystems, raw materials). Indeed, circular economy eventually aims at reducing the
environmental impact of the use of products, materials and other resources, minimizing waste and the release of
hazardous substances and hence at reducing impacts on nature. This application requirement focuses mainly on
the third phase of this LEAP approach, while the fourth phase addresses the outcome of the process.
AR 3. The process to assess the materiality of impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities shall consider the
provisions in ESRS 2 IRO-1 Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities
and IRO-2 Disclosure Requirements in ESRS covered by the undertaking’s sustainability statement.
AR 4. The sub-topics related to resource use and circular economy covered by the materiality assessment include:
(a) resource inflows including the circularity of material resource inflows, considering resource use optimisation,
intensity of materials and products and renewable and non-renewable resources;
(b) resource outflows related to products and services; and
(c) waste, including hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste management.
AR 5. In Phase 3, to assess its material risks and opportunities based on the results of Phases 1 and 2, the undertaking
may:
(a) identify transition risks and opportunities in its own operations and its upstream and downstream value
chain, including the risk of staying in a business-as-usual scenario:
i. policy and legal, e.g., bans on the extraction and use of non-renewable resources, regulations on waste
treatment;
ii. technology, e.g., introduction on the market of new technologies to replace existing use of products and
materials;
iii. market, e.g., shifting supply, demand and financing;
iv. reputation, e.g. changing societal, customer or community perceptions.OJ L, 22.12.2023 EN
