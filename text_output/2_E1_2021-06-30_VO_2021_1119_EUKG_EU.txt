I (Legislative acts) REGUL ATIONS REGUL ATION (EU) 2021/1119 OF THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 30 June 2021 establishing the framew ork for achieving climate neutrality and amending Regulations (EC) No 401/2009 and (EU) 2018/1999 (‘European Climate Law’) THE EUR OPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUR OPEAN UNION, Havi ng regar d to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof, Havi ng regar d to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draf t legislative act to the national parliaments, Havi ng regar d to the opinions of the European Economic and Social Committee (1), Havi ng regar d to the opinion of the Committ ee of the Regions (2), Acting in accordance with the ordinar y legislative procedure (3), Whereas: (1) The existential threat posed by climat e change requires enhanced ambition and increased climat e action by the Union and the Member States. The Union is committed to stepping up efforts to tackle climat e chang e and to deliver ing on the implementation of the Paris Agreement adopt ed under the United Nations Framew ork Conv ention on Climate Change (the ‘Pari s Agreement’) (4), guided by its principles and on the basis of the best available scientifi c kno wledge, in the conte xt of the long-t erm temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. (2) The Commission has, in its communication of 11 December 2019 entitled ‘The European Green Deal’ (the ‘European Green Deal’), set out a new growth strategy that aims to transf orm the Union into a fair and prosperous society , with a moder n, resource-effic ient and compe titive econom y, where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use. The European Green Deal also aims to prote ct, conser ve and enhance the Union’s natural capital, and prote ct the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impa cts. At the same time, this transition must be just and inclusive, leav ing no one behind. (3) The Intergover nmental Panel on Climat e Change (IPCC) provid es in its 2018 Special Repor t on the impacts of global warming of 1,5 °C above pre-industr ial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathwa ys, in the cont ext of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty, a strong scientifi c basis for tackling climate change and illustrates the need to rapidly step up climat e action (1)OJ C 364, 28.10.2020, p. 143, and OJ C 10, 11.1.2021, p. 69.

and to continue the transition to a climat e-neutral econom y. That repor t conf irms that greenhouse gas emissions need to be urgently reduced, and that climat e chang e needs to be limite d to 1,5 °C, in particular to reduce the likelihood of extreme weather events and of reac hing tipping points. The Intergo vernmental Science-P olicy Platf orm on Biodiversity and Ecosyst em Services (IPBES) has shown in its 2019 Global Assessment Repor t on Biodiversity and Ecosyst em Services a worldwide erosion of biodiversity , with climat e change as the third most important driver of biodiversity loss. (4) A fixed long-t erm objective is crucial to contr ibute to economic and societal transf ormation, high-quality jobs, sustainable growth, and the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, as well as to reach in a just, socially balanced, fair and cost-effe ctive manner the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. (5) It is necessar y to address the growing climat e-related risks to health, including more frequent and intense heatwa ves, wildfires and floods, food and wate r safety and secur ity threats, and the emerg ence and spread of infectious diseases. As announced in its communication of 24 Febr uary 2021 entitled ‘Forging a climate-resilient Europe – the new EU Strateg y on Adaptation to Climate Change’, the Commission has launch ed a European climate and health obser vator y under the European Climate Adaptation Platf orm Climate -AD APT , to better understand, anticipate and minimise the health threats caused by climat e change. (6) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and obser ves the principles recognised by the Char ter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular Article 37 thereof whic h seeks to promote the integration into the policies of the Union of a high level of environmental prot ection and the impro vement of the quality of the environment in accordance with the principle of sustainable development. (7) Climate action should be an oppor tunity for all sectors of the econom y in the Union to help secure industr y leadership in global innovati on. Driven by the Union’s regulator y framew ork and efforts made by industr y, it is possible to decouple economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. For example, Union greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by 24 % between 1990 and 2019, while the economy grew by 60 % over the same period. Without prejudice to binding legislation and other initiatives adopt ed at Union level, all sectors of the economy – including energy , industr y, transpor t, heating and cooling and buildings, agriculture, wast e and land use, land-use change and forestr y, irrespective of whether those sector s are covered by the system for greenhouse gas emission allowa nce trading within the Union (‘EU ETS’) – should play a role in contr ibuting to the achievement of climate neutrality within the Union by 2050. In order to enhance involvement of all economic actors , the Commission should facilita te sector -specifi c climate dialogues and partnerships by bringing together key stakeho lders in an inclusive and representative manner , so as to encourage sectors themselves to draw up indicative volun tary roadmaps and to plan their transition towards achieving the Union’s climat e-neutrality objective by 2050. Such roadmaps could make a valuable contr ibution in assisting sectors in planning the necessar y investments towards the transition to a climate -neutral economy and could also serve to strengthen sector al engagement in the pursuit of climat e-neutral solutions. Such roadmaps could also compl ement existing initiatives, including the European Batter y Alliance and the European Clean Hydrog en Alliance, which foster industr ial collaboration in the transition to climat e neutrality . (8) The Paris Agreement sets out a long-t erm temperature goal in point (a) of Article 2(1) thereof, and aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse imp acts of climat e change as set out in point (b) of Article 2(1) thereof and by making finance flows consiste nt with a pathwa y towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate -resilient development as set out in point (c) of Article 2(1) thereof. As the overall framework for the Union’s contr ibution to the Paris Agreement, this Regulation should ensure that both the Union and the Member States contr ibute to the global response to climate change as refer red to in the Paris Agreement.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 243/2 9.7.2021

(9) The Union’ s and Member States’ climat e action aims to prote ct people and the planet, welfare, prosper ity, the econom y, health, food systems, the integr ity of eco-systems and biodiversity against the threat of climate chang e, in the cont ext of the Unit ed Nations 2030 agenda for sustainable development and in pursuit of the objectives of the Paris Agreement, and to maximise prosper ity within the planetar y boundar ies and to increase resilience and reduce vulnerability of society to climat e change. In light of this, the Union’s and Member States’ actions should be guided by the precautionar y and ‘polluter pays’ principles established in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and should also take into account the ‘energy efficiency first ’ principle of the Energy Union and the ‘do no harm’ principle of the European Green Deal. (10) Achieving climate neutrality should require a contr ibution from all economic sector s for which emissions or remo vals of greenhouse gases are regulated in Union law. (11) In light of the impor tance of energy production and consump tion for the level of greenhouse gas emissions, it is essential to ensure a transition to a safe, sustainable, affordable and secure energy system relying on the deplo yment of renewables, a well-functioning intern al energy mark et and the improvement of energy efficiency , while reducing energy poverty. Digital transf ormation, technological innovati on, and research and development are also important drivers for achieving the climat e-neutrality objective. (12) The Union has in place a regulator y framew ork to achieve the 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction targe t agreed in 2014, before the entr y into force of the Paris Agreement. The legislation implementing that targe t consists, inter alia, of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), whic h establishes the EU ETS, Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), whic h introduced national targe ts for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), whic h requires Member States to balance greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestr y. (13) The EU ETS is a cornerstone of the Union’s climat e policy and constitute s its key tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effe ctive way. (14) The Commission has, in its communication of 28 November 2018 entitled ‘A Clean Planet for all – A European strateg ic long-t erm vision for a prosperous, moder n, compe titive and climate-neutral economy’ , present ed a vision for achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the Union by 2050 through a socially-fair and cost-efficient transition. (15) Through the ‘Clean Energy for All Europeans ’ packag e of 30 November 2016 the Union has been pursuing an ambitious decarbonisation agenda , in particular by constr ucting a robust Energy Union, whic h includes the 2030 goals for energy efficiency and deplo yment of renewable energy in Directives 2012/27/EU (8)and (EU) 2018/2001 (9)of the European Parliament and of the Council, and by reinf orcing relevant legislation, including Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (10). (16) The Union is a global leader in the transition towards climate neutrality , and it is determined to help raise global ambition and to strengthen the global response to climate change, using all tools at its disposal, including climate diplomacy . (5)Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32). (6)Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contr ibuting to climate action to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 (OJ L 156, 19.6.2018, p. 26). (7)Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and remov als from land use, land use change and forestr y in the 2030 climate and energy framework, and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 and Decision No 529/2013/EU (OJ L 156, 19.6.2018, p. 1). (8)Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency , amending Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC (OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, p. 1).

(17) The Union should continue its climate action and internatio nal climate leadership after 2050, in order to protect people and the planet against the threat of dang erous climat e change, in pursuit of the long-t erm temperature goal set out in the Paris Agreement and followi ng the scientific assessments of the IPCC, IPBES, and the European Scientific Advisor y Board on Climate Change, as well as the assessments of other international bodies. (18) The risk of carbon leakage remains in respect of those international partners that do not share the same standards of climat e protection as those of the Union. The Commission theref ore intends to propose a carbon border adjustment mechani sm for selected sectors , to reduce such risks in a way which is compatible with the rules of the World Trade Org anization. Further more, it is impor tant to maintain effective policy incentives in suppor t of technological solutions and innovati ons which enable the transition to a competitive climat e-neutral Union econom y, while provid ing investment certainty . (19) The European Parliament called, in its resolution of 15 Januar y 2020 on the European Green Deal, for the necessar y transition to a climat e-neutral society by 2050 at the lates t and for this to be made into a European success story and has, in its resolution of 28 November 2019 on the climat e and environment emergency , declared a climate and environment emerg ency . It has also repeate dly called on the Union to increase its 2030 climat e target , and for that increased target to be part of this Regulation. The European Council, in its conclusions of 12 December 2019 , has agreed on the objective of achieving a climat e-neutral Union by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, while also recognising that it is necessar y to put in place an enabling framework that benefi ts all Member States and encom passes adequate instr uments, incentives, suppor t and inve stments to ensure a cost- efficient, just, as well as socially balanced and fair transition, taking into account diffe rent national circumstances in term s of starting points. It also noted that the transition will require signif icant public and private investment. On 6 March 2020 , the Union submitted its long-t erm low greenhouse gas emission development strateg y and, on 17 December 2020 , its nationally deter mined contr ibution, to the United Nations Framew ork Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), following their approval by the Council. (20) The Union should aim to achieve a balance between anthropog enic econom y-wide emissions by sources and remo vals by sinks of greenhouse gases domestically within the Union by 2050 and, as appropr iate, achi eve negat ive emissions thereaf ter. That objective should encom pass Union-wide greenhouse gas emissions and remo vals regulated in Union law. It should be possible to address such emissions and removals in the context of the review of the relevant climat e and energy legislation. Sinks include natural and technological solutions, as repor ted in the Union’s greenhouse gas invent ories to the UNFCCC. Solutions that are based on carbon capture and storag e (CCS) and carbon captur e and use (CCU) technologies can play a role in decarbonisation, especially for the mitig ation of process emissions in industr y, for the Member State s that choose this technology . The Union-wide 2050 climate- neutrality objective should be pursued by all Member States collectively , and Member States, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should take the necessar y measures to enable its achi evement. Measures at Union level will constitute an impor tant part of the measures needed to achi eve the objective. (21) In its conclusions of 8and 9 Marc h 2007 and of 23and 24 October 2014 , the European Council endorsed the Union’s greenhouse gas emission reduction target for 2020 and the 2030 climate and energy policy framewor k, respectively . The provisions of this Regulation on the deter mination of the Union’s climate target for 2040 are without prejudice to the role of the European Council, as set out in the Treaties, in defining the Union’s general political direction and priorities for the development of the Union’s climate policy . (22) Carbon sinks play an essential role in the transition to climate neutrality in the Union, and in particular the agriculture, forestr y and land use sector s make an important contr ibution in that cont ext. As announced in its communication of 20 May 2020 entitled ‘A Farm to Fork Strate gy for a fair, healthy and environmentally-fr iendly food system’ , the Commission will promote a new green business model to reward land managers for greenhouse gas emission reductions and carbon remo vals in the upcoming carbon farming initiative. Further more, in its communication of 11 March 2020 entitled ‘A new Circular Economy Action Plan for a cleaner and more competitive Europe ’, the Commission has committed itself to developing a regulatory framework for certificat ion of EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 243/4 9.7.2021

carbon removals based on robust and transparent carbon accounting to monitor and verify the authenticity of carbon removals, while ensur ing that there are no negative impacts on the environment, in particular biodiversity , on public health or on social or economic objectives. (23) The restoration of ecosystems would assist in maintaining, managing and enhancing natural sinks and promote biodiversity while fighting climat e change . Further more, the ‘triple role’ of forests, namely , as carbon sinks, storage and substitution, contr ibut es to the reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, while ensur ing that forests continue to grow and provide man y other services. (24) Scientific exper tise and the best available, up-to -date evidence, together with information on climate chang e that is both factual and transparent, are imperative and need to under pin the Union’s climat e action and efforts to reach climat e neutrality by 2050. A European Scientific Advisor y Board on Climate Change (the ‘Advisor y Board’) should be established to serve as a point of referen ce on scientific kno wledge relating to climate change by virtue of its independence and scientific and technical exper tise. The Advisor y Board should complement the work of the European Envi ronment Agen cy (EEA) while acting independently in disc harging its tasks. Its mission should avoid any overlap with the mission of the IPCC at international level. Regulation (EC) No 401/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11)should theref ore be amended in order to establish the Advisor y Board. National climat e advisor y bodies can play an important role in, inter alia, provid ing exper t scientific advice on climat e policy to the relevant national author ities as prescr ibed by the Member State concer ned in those Member States where they exist. Theref ore, Member States that have not already done so are invit ed to establish a national climat e advisor y body . (25) The transition to climate neutrality requires change s across the entire policy spectr um and a collective effort of all sector s of the economy and society , as highlighted in the European Green Deal. The European Council, in its conclusions of 12 December 2019 , stated that all relevant Union legislation and policies need to be consistent with, and contr ibut e to, the fulfilme nt of the climat e-neutrality objective while respecting a level playing field, and invited the Commission to examine whether this requires an adjustment of the existing rules. (26) As announced in the European Green Deal, the Commission assessed the Union’s 2030 target for greenhouse gas emission reduction, in its communication of 17 September 2020 entitled ‘Stepping up Europe ’s 2030 climat e ambition – Investing in a climate -neutral future for the benefi t of our people ’. The Commission did so on the basis of a compre hensive impact assessment and taking into account its analysis of the integrat ed national energy and climat e plans submitted to it in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12). In light of the 2050 climate-neutrality objective, by 2030 greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced and remo vals enhanced, so that net greenhouse gas emissions, that is emissions after the deduction of removals, are reduced economy-wide and domestically by at least 55 % by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The European Council endorsed that target in its conclusions of 10and 11 December 2020 . It also provid ed initial guidance on its imp lementation. That new Union 2030 climate target is a subsequent target for the purposes of point (11) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, and theref ore replaces the 2030 Union-wide target for greenhouse gas emissions set out in that point. In addition, the Commission should, by 30 June 2021 , assess how the relevant Union legislation imp lementing the Union 2030 climat e target would need to be amended in order to achieve such net emission reductions. In view of this, the Commission has announced a revision of the relevant climate and energy legislation whic h will be adopt ed in a packag e covering, inter alia, renewables, energy efficiency , land use, energy taxation, CO2 emission performa nce standards for light-duty vehicles, effort shar ing and the EU ETS. (11)Regulation (EC) No 401/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 Apr il 2009 on the European Environment Agency and the European Environment Information and Obser vation Network (OJ L 126, 21.5.2009, p. 13). (12)Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governa nce of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 1).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 9.7.2021 L 243/5

The Commission intends to assess the impacts of the introduction of additional Union measures that could compl ement existing measures, such as market-based measures that include a strong solidar ity mechanis m. (27) According to Commission assessments, the existing commitments under Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 result in a net carbon sink of 225 million tonnes of CO 2 equivalent in 2030. In order to ensure that suffi cient mitig ation efforts are deplo yed until 2030, it is appropr iate to limit the contr ibution of net removals to the Union 2030 climat e target to that level. This is without prejudice to the review of the relevant Union legislation in order to enable the achievement of the target. (28) Expenditure under the Union budget and the European Union Recov ery Instr ument established by Council Regulation (EU) 2020/2094 (13)contr ibut es to climat e objectives, by dedicating at least 30 % of the tota l amount of the expenditure to suppor ting climat e objectives, on the basis of an effective methodology and in accordance with sector al legislation. (29) In light of the objective of achieving climat e neutrality by 2050 and in view of the international commitments under the Paris Agreement, continued efforts are necessar y to ensure the phasing out of energy subsidies which are incompati ble with that objective, in particular for fossil fuels, without impa cting efforts to reduce energy poverty. (30) In order to provid e predictability and conf idence for all economic actors , including businesses, work ers, investors and consumers, to ensure a gradual reduction of greenhouse gas emissions over time and that the transition towards climate neutrality is irreversible, the Commission should propose a Union interm ediate climate targe t for 2040, as appropr iate, at the latest within six months of the first global stoc ktake carried out under the Paris Agreement. The Commission can make proposals to revise the intermediat e target, taking into account the findings of the assessments of Union progress and measures and of national measures as well as the outcomes of the global stoc ktake and of intern ational developments, including on common time frames for nationally deter mined contr ibutions. As a tool to increase the transparency and accountability of the Union’s climate policies, the Commission should, when making its legislative proposal for the Union 2040 climate target, publish the project ed indicative Union greenhouse gas budget for the 2030-2050 period, defined as the indicative total volume of net greenhouse gas emissions that are expected to be emitted in that period without putting at risk the Union’s commitments under the Paris Agreement, as well as the methodology underlying that indicative budget. (31) Adaptation is a key compo nent of the long-t erm global response to climat e change. The adverse effects of climate change can poten tially exceed the adap tive capacities of Member States. Theref ore, Member State s and the Union should enhance their adaptiv e capacity , strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climat e chang e, as provided for in Article 7 of the Paris Agreement, as well as maximise the co-benefi ts with other policies and legislation. The Commission should adopt a Union strategy on adaptation to climate change in line with the Paris Agreement. Member States should adopt compr ehensive national adap tation strateg ies and plans based on robust climat e change and vulnerability analyses, progress assessments and indicators, and guided by the best available and most recent scientific evidence. The Union should seek to creat e a favourable regulatory environment for national policies and measures put in place by Member State s to adapt to climate change. Improving climate resilience and adap tive capacities to climat e chang e requires shared efforts by all sectors of the econom y and society , as well as policy coherence and consist ency in all relevant legislation and policies. (32) Ecosyst ems, people and economies in all regions of the Union will face major impacts from climate change, such as extreme heat, floods, droughts, wate r scarcity , sea level rise, thawing glaciers, forest fires, windthrows and agricultural losses. Recent extreme events have already had substantial impacts on ecosystems , affecting carbon sequestration and storag e capacities of forest and agricultural land. Enhancing adap tive capacities and resilience, taking into account the Unit ed Nations Sustainable Development Goals, help to minimise climat e change impa cts, to address unav oidable impacts in a socially balanced manner and to improve living conditions in impact ed areas.

Prepar ing early for such impa cts is cost-effective and can also bring considerable co-benef its for ecosystems , health and the econom y. Nature-based solutions, in particular , can benefit climat e change mitigation, adap tation and biodiversity protection. (33) The relevant programmes established under the Multiannual Financial Framework provide for the screening of projects to ensure that such projects are resilient to the poten tial adverse impact s of climate change through a climat e vulnerability and risk assessment, including through relevant adap tation measures, and that they integrat e the costs of greenhouse gas emissions and the positive effects of climat e mitig ation measures in the cost-benefi t analysis. This contr ibut es to the integration of climat e change-relat ed risks as well as climate chang e vulnerability and adap tation assessments into investment and planning decisions under the Union budget. (34) In taking the relevant measures at Union and national level to achi eve the climat e-neutrality objective, Member States and the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should, inter alia, take into account: the contr ibution of the transition to climate neutrality to public health, the quality of the environment, the well-being of citizens, the prosper ity of society , emplo yment and the competitiveness of the econom y; the energy transition, strengthened energy secur ity and the tackling of energy poverty; food secur ity and affordability ; the development of sustainable and smar t mobility and transpor t systems; fairn ess and solidar ity across and within Member States, in light of their economic capability , national circumstances, such as the specifi cities of islands, and the need for converg ence over time; the need to make the transition just and socially fair through appropr iate education and training programmes; best available and most recent scientifi c evidence, in particular the findings repor ted by the IPCC; the need to integrat e climate change relat ed risks into investment and planning decisions; cost-effe ctiveness and technological neutrality in achi eving greenhouse gas emission reductions and remo vals and increasing resilience; and progression over time in environmental integrity and level of ambition. (35) As indicated in the European Green Deal, the Commission adopt ed on 9 December 2020 a communication entitled ‘Sustainable and Smar t Mobility Strategy – putting European transpor t on track for the future’. The strateg y sets out a roadmap for a sustainable and smar t future for European transpor t, with an action plan towards an objective to deliver a 90 % reduction in emissions from the transpor t sector by 2050. (36) To ensure that the Union and the Member State s remain on track to achieve the climate-neutrality objective and progress on adap tation, the Commission should regularly assess progress, building upon information as set out in this Regulation, including information submitte d and repor ted under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. In order to allow for a timely preparation for the global stoc ktake refer red to in Article 14 of the Paris Agreement, the conclusions of this assessment should be published by 30 September ever y five years, starting in 2023. This implies that the repor ts under Article 29(5) and Article 35 of that Regulation and, in the applicable years, the relat ed repor ts under Article 29(1) and Article 32 of that Regulation should be submitted to the European Parliament and to the Council at the same time as the conclusions of that assessment. In the event that the collective progress made by Member States towards the achi evement of the climat e-neutrality objective or on adapta tion is insuffic ient or that Union measures are inconsiste nt with the climat e-neutrality objective or inadequate to enhance adap tive capacity , strengthen resilience or reduce vulnerability , the Commission should take the necessar y measures in accordance with the Treaties. The Commission should also regularly assess relevant national measures, and issue recommendations where it finds that a Member State’s measures are inconsistent with the climat e-neutrality objective or inadequat e to enhance adap tive capacity , strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climat e chang e. (37) The Commission should ensure a robust and objective assessment based on the most up-to -date scientific, technical and socioeconomic findings, and representative of a broad rang e of independent exper tise, and base its assessment on relevant information including information submitted and repor ted by Member States, repor ts of the EEA, of the Advisor y Board and of the Commission’s Joint Research Centre, the best available and most recent scientifi c evidence, including the latest repor ts of the IPCC, IPBES and other international bodies, as well as the Earth obser vation data provided by the European Earth Obser vation Programme Coper nicus. The Commission should further base its assessments on an indicative, linear traject ory linking the Union’s climat e targets for 2030 and 2040, when adopt ed, with the Union’s climate -neutrality objective and serving as an indicative tool to estimate EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 9.7.2021 L 243/7

and evaluate collective progress towards the achi evement of the Union’s climat e-neutrality objective. The indicative, linear traject ory is without prejudice to any decision to deter mine a Union climate targe t for 2040. Given that the Commission has committed itself to explor ing how the EU taxonom y can be used in the context of the European Green Deal by the public sector, this should include information on envi ronmentally sustainable inve stment, by the Union or by Member State s, consiste nt with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14)when such information becomes available. The Commission should use European and global statistics and data where available and seek exper t scrutiny . The EEA should assist the Commission, as appropr iate and in accordance with its annual work programme. (38) As citizens and communities have a powerful role to play in driving the transf ormation towards climat e neutrality forward, strong public and social engag ement on climat e action should be both encourag ed and facilitated at all levels, including at national, regional and local level in an inclusive and accessible process. The Commission should theref ore enga ge with all parts of society , including stakeho lders representing diffe rent sector s of the econom y, to enable and empo wer them to take action towards a climate -neutral and climat e-resilient society , including through the European Climate Pact. (39) In line with the Commission’s commitment to the principles on Better Law-Making, coherence of the Union instr uments as regar ds greenhouse gas emission reductions should be sought. The syste m of measur ing the progress towards the achi evement of the climate -neutrality objective as well as the consist ency of measures taken with that objective should build upon and be consist ent with the governance framew ork laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, taking into account all five dimensions of the Energy Union. In particular , the system of repor ting on a regular basis and the sequencing of the Commission’s assessment and actions on the basis of the repor ting should be aligned to the requirements to submit information and provide repor ts by Member States laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 should theref ore be amended in order to include the climate- neutrality objective in the relevant provisions. (40) Climate change is by definition a trans-boundar y challeng e and coordinat ed action at Union level is needed to effectively supplement and reinf orce national policies. Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to achieve climat e neutrality in the Union by 2050, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member State s, but can rather , by reason of the scale and effects, be better achieve d at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiar ity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of propor tionality , as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessar y to achieve that objective, HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGUL ATION: Article 1 Subject matter and scope This Regulation establishes a framewor k for the irreversible and gradual reduction of anthropog enic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and enhancement of removals by sinks regulate d in Union law. This Regulation sets out a binding objective of climate neutrality in the Union by 2050 in pursuit of the long-ter m temperature goal set out in point (a) of Article 2(1) of the Paris Agreement, and provides a framew ork for achi eving progress in pursuit of the global adapt ation goal established in Article 7 of the Paris Agreement. This Regulation also sets out a binding Union target of a net domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for 2030. (14)Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitat e sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (OJ L 198, 22.6.2020, p. 13).EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union L 243/8 9.7.2021

This Regulation applies to anthropog enic emissions by sources and removals by sink s of the greenhouse gases listed in Part 2 of Annex V to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. Article 2 Climate-neutrality objectiv e 1. Union-wide greenhouse gas emissions and remo vals regulated in Union law shall be balanced within the Union at the latest by 2050, thus reducing emissions to net zero by that date, and the Union shall aim to achieve negative emissions thereaf ter. 2. The relevant Union institutions and the Member States shall take the necessar y measures at Union and national level, respectively , to enable the collective achievement of the climate-neutrality objective set out in paragraph 1, taking into account the importance of promoting both fairness and solidar ity among Member States and cost-effectiveness in achi eving this objective. Article 3 Scientif ic advice on climate change 1. The European Scientifi c Advisor y Board on Climat e Change established under Article 10a of Regulation (EC) No 401/2009 (the ‘Advisor y Board’) shall serve as a point of referen ce for the Union on scientifi c knowledg e relating to climat e change by virtue of its independence and scientifi c and technical exper tise. 2. The task s of the Advisor y Board shall include: (a) consider ing the latest scientific findings of the IPCC repor ts and scientifi c climat e data, in particular with regard to information relevant to the Union; (b) providing scientifi c advice and issuing repor ts on existing and proposed Union measures, climat e targe ts and indicative greenhouse gas budget s, and their coherence with the objectives of this Regulation and the Union’s intern ational commitments under the Paris Agreement ; (c) contr ibuting to the exchang e of independent scientific kno wledge in the field of modelling, monitori ng, promising research and innovati on whic h contr ibute to reducing emissions or increasing removals; (d) identifying actions and oppor tunities needed to successfully achieve the Union climat e targe ts; (e) raising awar eness on climat e chang e and its impacts, as well as stimulating dialogue and cooperation between scientific bodies within the Union, complementing existing work and efforts. 3. The Advisor y Board shall be guided in its work by the best available and most recent scientific evidence, including the latest repor ts of the IPCC, IPBES and other international bodies. It shall follow a fully transparent process and make its repor ts publicly available. It may take into account, where available, the work of the national climat e advisor y bodies refer red to in paragraph 4. 4. In the context of enhancing the role of science in the field of climate policy , each Member State is invit ed to establish a national climat e advisor y body , responsible for providing exper t scientifi c advice on climat e policy to the relevant national author ities as prescr ibed by the Member State concer ned. Where a Member State decides to establish such an advisor y body , it shall inform the EEA thereof. Article 4 Inter mediate Union climate targets 1. In order to reach the climat e-neutrality objective set out in Article 2(1), the binding Union 2030 climate target shall be a domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions (emissions after deduction of remo vals) by at least 55 % compare d to 1990 levels by 2030.EN Offi cial Jour nal of the European Union 9.7.2021 L 243/9

When imple menting the targe t refer red to in the first subparagraph, the relevant Union institutions and the Member States shall prioritise swif t and predictable emission reductions and, at the same time, enhance removals by natural sinks. In order to ensure that suffi cient mitig ation efforts are deplo yed up to 2030, for the purpose of this Regulation and without prejudice to the review of Union legislation refer red to in paragraph 2, the contr ibution of net remo vals to the Union 2030 climat e target shall be limited to 225 million tonnes of CO 2 equivalent. In order to enhance the Union’s carbon sink in line with the objective of achi eving climate neutrality by 2050, the Union shall aim to achi eve a higher volume of its net carbon sink in 2030. 2. By 30 June 2021 , the Commission shall review relevant Union legislation in order to enable the achievement of the target set out in paragraph 1 of this Article and the climate-neutrality objective set out in Article 2(1) and consider taking the necessar y measures, including the adoptio n of legislative proposals, in accordance with the Treaties. Within the framew ork of the review refer red to in the first subparagraph and future reviews, the Commission shall assess in particular the availability under Union law of adequat e instr uments and incentives to mobilise the investments needed, and propose measures as necessar y. From the adoption of the legislative proposals by the Commission, it shall monitor the legislative procedures for the differ ent proposals and may repor t to the European Parliament and to the Council on whether the foreseen outcome of those legislative procedures, considered together , would achieve the targe t set out in paragraph 1. If the foreseen outcome would not deliver a result in line with the target set out in paragraph 1, the Commission may take the necessar y measures, including the adopt ion of legislative proposals, in accordance with the Treaties. 3. With a view to achi eving the climat e-neutrality objective set out in Article 2(1) of this Regulation, a Union-wide climat e target for 2040 shall be set.
