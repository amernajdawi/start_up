ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 31/164Life-cycle GHG emissions of plastic manufactured from sustainable bio-waste feedstock
are lower than the life-cycle GHG emissions of the equivalent plastics in primary form
manufactured from fossil fuel feedstock. Life-cycle GHG emissions are calculated using
Commission Recommendation 2013/179/EU (13)or, alternatively, using ISO
14067:2018 or ISO 14064-1:2018. Quantified life-cycle GHG emissions are verified
by an independent third party.
(2) Climate change adaptation The activity complies with criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.
(3) Sustainable use and protec ­
tion of water and marine resourcesThe activity complies with criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.
(5) Pollution prevention and controlThe activity complies with criteria set out in Appendix C to this Annex.
For the products manufactured from plastic materials in primary form, emissions from
the manufacturing of those plastic materials are within or lower than the emission levels
associated with the best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges set out in the relevant
best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, including:
(a) the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste water and waste
gas treatment/management systems in the chemical sector (
14), for emissions to
water where relevant emission thresholds apply;
(b) the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for common waste gas management
and treatment systems in the chemical sector (15)for emissions to air of new
installations (or for existing installations within 4 years of the BATC publication)
where relevant conditions apply;
(c) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for the Production of Polymers (
16)for the production processes under conditions not covered by the
BATC mentioned above;
(d) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for the Large Volume
Inorganic Chemicals – Solids and Others industry (17);
(e) the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for the manufacture of
Large Volume Inorganic Chemicals – Ammonia, Acids and Fertilisers (18);

gas management and treatment systems in the chemical sector (OJ L 318, 12.12.2022, p. 157).
