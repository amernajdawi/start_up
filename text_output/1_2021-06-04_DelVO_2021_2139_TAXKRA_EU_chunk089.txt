(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  The activity assesses the availability of and, where feasible, adopts tech ­
niques that support:
(a) reuse and use of secondary raw materials and reused components in
products manufactured;
(b) design for high durability, recyclability, easy disassembly and adapt ­
ability of products manufactured;
(c) waste management that prioritises recycling over disposal, in the
manufacturing process;
(d) information on and traceability of substances of concern throughout
the life cycle of the manufactured products.  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix C to this 
Annex.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
3.6.  Manufacture of other low carbon technologies  
Description of the activity  
Manufacture of technologies aimed at substantial GHG emission reductions in other sectors of the economy,
where those technologies are not covered in Sections 3.1 to 3.5 of this Annex.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes, in particular from C22,
C25, C26, C27 and C28 in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities established by
Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is an enabling activity in accordance with Article 10(1), point (i), of
Regulation (EU) 2020/852 where it complies with the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
The economic activity manufactures technologies that are aimed at and demonstrate substantial life-cycle GHG
emission savings compared to the best performing alternative technology/product/solution available on the
market.
Life-cycle GHG emission savings are calculated using Commission Recommendation 2013/179/EU (  96 ) or, alter ­
natively, ISO 14067:2018 (  97 ) or ISO 14064-1:2018 (  98 ). 
Quantified life-cycle GHG emission savings are verified by an independent third party.
