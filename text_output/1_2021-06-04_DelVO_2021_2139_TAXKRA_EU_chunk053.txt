Detailed information referred to in points 1.2(k) (Afforestation plan) and
1.4(i) (Forest management plan or equivalent system) include provisions
for maintaining and possibly enhancing biodiversity in accordance with
national and local provisions, including the following:
(a) ensuring the good conservation status of habitat and species, main ­
tenance of typical habitat species;
(b) excluding the use or release of invasive alien species;
(c) excluding the use of non-native species unless it can be demonstrated
that:
(i) the use of the forest reproductive material leads to favourable and
appropriate ecosystem conditions (such as climate, soil criteria and
vegetation zone, forest fire resilience);
(ii) the native species currently present on the site are not anymore
adapted to projected climatic and pedo-hydrological conditions.
(d) ensuring the maintenance and improvement of physical, chemical and
biological quality of the soil;
(e) promoting biodiversity-friendly practices that enhance forests’ natural
processes;
(f) excluding the conversion of high-biodiverse ecosystems into less
biodiverse ones;
(g) ensuring the diversity of associated habitats and species linked to the
forest;
(h) ensuring the diversity of stand structures and maintenance or
enhancing of mature stage stands and dead wood.  
1.2.  Rehabilitation and restoration of forests, including reforestation and natural forest regeneration after an 
extreme event  
Description of the activity  
Rehabilitation and restoration of forests as defined by national law. Where national law does not contain such a
definition, rehabilitation and restoration corresponds to a definition with broad agreement in the peer-reviewed
scientific literature for specific countries or a definition in line with the FAO concept of forest restoration (  21 ) or aEN  9.12.2021 Official Journal of the European Union L 442/21  
( 21 ) Forest restoration includes:  
— rehabilitation, meaning the restoration of desired species, structures or processes to an existing ecosystem;  
— reconstruction, meaning restoration of native plants on land which is in another use;  
— reclamation, meaning restoration of severely degraded land devoid of vegetation;  
— most radically replacement, in which species maladapted for a given location and unable to migrate are replaced with introduc ed
species as climates change rapidly,
