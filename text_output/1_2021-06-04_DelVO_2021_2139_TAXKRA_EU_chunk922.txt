(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(1) Climate change mitigation  The activity is not undertaken for the purposes of fossil fuel extraction or 
fossil fuel transport.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  N/A  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  N/A  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  N/A  
9.2.  Close to market research, development and innovation  
Description of the activity  
Research, applied research and experimental development of solutions, processes, technologies, business models
and other products dedicated to climate change adaptation.  
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code M72 or for research that is an integral
part of those economic activities for which technical screening criteria are specified in this Annex the NACE codes
set out in other Sections of this Annex in accordance with the statistical classification of economic activities
established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.  
An economic activity in this category is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation
(EU) 2020/852 where it meets the technical screening criteria set out in this Section.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation  
1. The economic activity researches, innovates or develops solutions, technologies, products, processes or
business models, including nature based and nature inspired solutions (  638  ), dedicated to enable one or more 
activities for which the technical screening criteria have been specified in this Annex to meet the respective criteria
for substantial contribution to climate change adaptation to increase their climate-resilience, while respecting the
relevant criteria for doing no significant harm to other environmental objectives.
2. Where the researched, developed or innovated technology, product or other solution already enables an
activity or several activities addressed in this Annex to meet their technical screening criteria for substantial
contribution, the research, development and innovation activity focuses on the delivery of technologies,
products or other solutions with new significant advantages, such as better performance or lower cost.
