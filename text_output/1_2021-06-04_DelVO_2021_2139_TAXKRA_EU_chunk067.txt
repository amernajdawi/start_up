(c) excluding the use of non-native species unless it can be demonstrated
that:
(i) the use of the forest reproductive material leads to favourable and
appropriate ecosystem condition (such as climate, soil criteria, and
vegetation zone, forest fire resilience);
(ii) the native species currently present on the site are not anymore
adapted to projected climatic and pedo-hydrological conditions;
(d) ensuring the maintenance and improvement of physical, chemical and
biological quality of the soil;
(e) promoting biodiversity-friendly practices that enhance forests’ natural
processes;
(f) excluding the conversion of high-biodiverse ecosystems into less
biodiverse ones;
(g) ensuring the diversity of associated habitats and species linked to the
forest;
(h) ensuring the diversity of stand structures and maintenance or
enhancing of mature stage stands and dead wood.  
1.4.  Conservation forestry  
Description of the activity  
Forest management activities with the objective of preserving one or more habitats or species. Conservation
forestry assumes no change in land category and occurs on land matching the forest definition as set out in
national law, or where not available, in accordance with the FAO definition of forest (  50 ). 
The economic activities in this category could be associated with NACE code A2 in accordance with the statistical
classification of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006. The economic activities in this
category are limited to NACE II 02.10, i.e. silviculture and other forestry activities, 02.20, i.e. logging, 02.30,
i.e. gathering of wild growing non-wood products, and 02.40, i.e. support services to forestry.  
Technical screening criteria  
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation  
1. Forest management plan or equivalent instrument  
1.1. The activity takes place on area that is subject to a forest management plan or an equivalent instrument,
as set out in national law or, where national regulation dos not define a forest management plan, as referred to
in the FAO definition of ‘forest area with long-term forest management plan’ (  51 ). 
The forest management plan or the equivalent instrument covers a period of 10 years or more and is
continuously updated.
1.2. Information is provided on the following points that are not already documented in the forest
management plan or equivalent system:
(a) management goals, including major constraints;
(b) general strategies and activities planned to reach the management goals, including expected operations over
the whole forest cycle;
