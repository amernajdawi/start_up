ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/2486/oj 2/164prevention and control, and to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. Those technical
screening criteria should be adopted in addition to the technical screening criteria established in Commission
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 (4).
(4) The technical screening criteria for environmental objectives covering the sustainable use and protection of water
and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, should, like the technical screening criteria established in Delegated
Regulation (EU) 2021/2139, where possible, follow the classification of economic activities laid down in the NACE
Revision 2 classification system of economic activities established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 of the
European Parliament and of the Council (
5). To facilitate the identification by undertakings and financial market
participants of the relevant economic activities for which technical screening criteria should be established, the
specific description of an economic activity should also include indicative references to NACE codes that can be associated with that activity. Those references should be understood as indicative and should not prevail over the specific definition of the economic activity provided in its description.
(5) The technical screening criteria for economic activities that contribute substantially to the sustainable use and
protection of water and marine resources, to the transition to a circular economy, to pollution prevention and
control, and to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems should ensure that the economic activity concerned has a positive impact on one of those objectives. Those technical screening criteria should therefore refer to thresholds or performance levels that the economic activity should achieve to qualify as contributing substantially to one of those objectives. The technical screening criteria for ‘do no significant harm’ (DNSH) should ensure that the economic activity has no significant negative environmental impacts, including
climate-related impacts. Consequently, those technical screening criteria should specify the minimum requirements
that the economic activity should meet to qualify as environmentally sustainable.
(6) The technical screening criteria for determining whether an economic activity contributes substantially to one of the environmental objectives laid down in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and does no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives should, where relevant build, on existing Union law, best practices, standards and methodologies, and well-established standards, practices and methodologies developed by internationally reputed
public entities. Where those standards, practices and methodologies are not available for a specific policy area, the
technical screening criteria should build on well-established standards developed by internationally reputed private
bodies.
(7) Pursuant to Article 19(1), point (h), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, the technical screening criteria should take into account the nature and the scale of the economic activity and sector that they refer to, and whether the economic
activity is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 16 of that Regulation. For the technical screening criteria to
meet the requirements of Article 19 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 in an effective and balanced way, those technical
screening criteria should be set as a quantitative threshold or minimum requirement, a relative improvement, a set of qualitative performance requirements, process or practice-based requirements, or a precise description of the nature of the economic activity itself where that activity by its nature can contribute substantially to the environmental objectives.
(4)Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of 4 June 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European
Parliament and of the Council by establishing the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an economic
activity qualifies as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation and for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives (OJ L 442, 9.12.2021, p. 1).
