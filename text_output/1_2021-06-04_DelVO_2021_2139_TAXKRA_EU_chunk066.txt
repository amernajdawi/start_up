(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.
Detailed information referred to in point 1.2. (i) includes provisions to
comply with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  The silvicultural change induced by the activity on the area covered by the 
activity is not likely to result in a significant reduction of sustainable
supply of primary forest biomass suitable for the manufacturing of
wood-based products with long-term circularity potential. This criterion
may be demonstrated through the climate benefits analysis referred to in
point (2).  
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The use of pesticides is reduced and alternative approaches or techniques, 
which may include non-chemical alternatives to pesticides, are favoured, in
accordance with Directive 2009/128/EC, with exception of occasions
where the use of pesticides is needed to control outbreaks of pests and
of diseases.
The activity minimised the use of fertilisers and does not use manure. The
activity complies with Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 or national rules on
fertilisers or soil improvers for agricultural use.
Well documented and verifiable measures are taken to avoid the use of
active ingredients that are listed in Annex I, part A, of Regulation (EU)
2019/1021 of the European Parliament and of the Council (  48 ), the 
Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed consent procedure for
certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade, the
Minamata Convention on Mercury, the Montreal Protocol on Substances
that Deplete the Ozone Layer, and of active ingredients that are listed as
classification Ia (‘extremely hazardous’) or Ib (‘highly hazardous’) in the
WHO Recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard (  49 ). The 
activity complies with the relevant national law on active ingredients.
Pollution of water and soil is prevented and cleaning up measures are
undertaken when pollution occurs.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  In areas designated by the national competent authority for conservation 
or in habitats that are protected, the activity is in accordance with the
conservation objectives for those areas.
There is no conversion of habitats specifically sensitive to biodiversity loss
or with high conservation value, or of areas set aside for the restoration of
such habitats in accordance with national law.
Detailed information referred to in point 1.2.(i) includes provisions for
maintaining and possibly enhancing biodiversity in accordance with
national and local provisions, including the following:
(a) ensuring the good conservation status of habitat and species, main ­
tenance of typical habitat species;
(b) excluding the use or release of invasive alien species;
