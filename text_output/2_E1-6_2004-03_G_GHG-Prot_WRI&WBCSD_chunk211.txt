Renewable energy Energy taken from sources that are inexhaustible, e.g. wind, water, solar, geothermal energy, and biofuels.
Reporting Presenting data to internal management and external users such as regulators, shareholders, the
general public or specific stakeholder groups. (Chapter 9)
Reversibility of reductions This occurs when reductions are temporary, or where removed or stored carbon may be returned to the
atmosphere at some point in the future. (Chapter 8)
Rolling base year The process of shifting or rolling the base year forward by  a certain number of years at regular inter-
vals of time. (Chapter 5, 11)
Scientific Uncertainty Uncertainty that arises when the science of the actual emission and/or removal process is not
completely understood. (Chapter 7)
Scope Defines the operational boundaries in relation to indirect and direct GHG emissions. (Chapter 4)
Scope 1 inventory A reporting organization’s direct GHG emissions. (Chapter 4)
Scope 2 inventory A reporting organization’s emissions associated with the generation of electricity, heating/ cooling, or
steam purchased for own consumption. (Chapter 4)
Scope 3 inventory A reporting organization’s indirect emissions other than those covered in scope 2. (Chapter 4)
Scope of works An up-front specification that indicates the type of verification to be undertaken and the level of
assurance to be provided between the reporting company and the verifier during the verificationprocess. (Chapter 10)
Secondary effects (Leakage) GHG emissions changes resulting from the project not captured by the primary effect(s). These are
typically the small, unintended GHG consequences of a project. (Chapter 8)
Sequestered atmospheric carbon Carbon removed from the atmosphere by biological sinks and stored in plant tissue. Sequestered
atmospheric carbon does not include GHGs captured through carbon capture and storage.
Significance threshold A qualitative or quantitative criteria used to define a significant structural change. It is the responsi-
bility of the company/ verifier to determine the “significance threshold” for considering base yearemissions recalculation. In most cases the “significance threshold” depends on the use of the infor-mation, the characteristics of the company, and the features of structural changes. (Chapter 5)
Stationary Combustion Burning of fuels to generate electricity, steam, heat, or power in stationary equipment such as boilers,
furnaces etc.
Structural change A change in the organizational or operational boundaries of a company that result in the transfer of
