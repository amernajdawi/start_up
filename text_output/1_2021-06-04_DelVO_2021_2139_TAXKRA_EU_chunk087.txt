The economic activity recycles end-of-life batteries.  
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)  
(2) Climate change adaptation  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this 
Annex.  
(3) Sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this 
Annex.  
(4) Transition to a circular economy  For manufacturing of new batteries, components and materials, the activity 
assesses the availability of and, where feasible, adopts techniques that
support:
(a) reuse and use of secondary raw materials and reused components in
products manufactured;
(b) design for high durability, recyclability, easy disassembly and adapt ­
ability of products manufactured;
(c) information on and traceability of substances of concern throughout
the life cycle of the manufactured products.
Recycling processes meet the conditions set out in Article 12 of Directive
2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (  91 ) and in 
Annex III, Part B, to that Directive, including the use of the latest relevant
Best Available Techniques, the achievement of the efficiencies specified for
lead-acid batteries, nickel-cadmium batteries and for other chemistries.
These processes ensure the recycling of the metal content to the highest
degree that is technically feasible while avoiding excessive costs.
Where applicable, facilities carrying out recycling processes meet the
requirements laid down in Directive 2010/75/EU of the European
Parliament and of the Council (  92 ). 
(5) Pollution prevention and control  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix C to this 
Annex.
Batteries comply with the applicable sustainability rules on the placing on
the market of batteries in the Union, including restrictions on the use of
hazardous substances in batteries, including Regulation (EC)
No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (  93 ) and 
Directive 2006/66/EC.  
(6) Protection and restoration of
biodiversity and ecosystems  The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this 
Annex.  
3.5.  Manufacture of energy efficiency equipment for buildings
