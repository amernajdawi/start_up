Substantial contribution to the transition to a circular economy
1.The activities consist of the material recovery of secondary raw materials (including chemical substances and critical raw
materials) from source segregated hazardous waste.
2.The recovered materials are substituting primary raw materials, including critical raw materials, or chemicals in
production processes (53).
3.The recovered materials comply with the applicable industry specifications, harmonised standards, or end-of-waste
criteria, as well as relevant applicable Union and national legislation.
Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’)
(1) Climate change mitigation The activity, on a life-cycle basis, does not increase GHG emissions as compared to the
production based on the equivalent primary raw material(s).
Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions are calculated using Recommendation
2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using ISO 14067:2018 (54)or ISO 14064-1:2018 (55).
Quantified life-cycle GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party.
(2) Climate change adaptation The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.
(3) Sustainable use and protec ­
tion of water and marine
resourcesThe activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.
Relevant techniques are deployed for the protection of water and marine resources, as set
out in the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for waste treatment (56).
(5) Pollution prevention and
controlAll substances, and mixtures recovered comply with the applicable relevant legislation, such as Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, Regulation (EU) 2019/1021, Regulation (EC)
No 1272/2008 and Directive 2008/98/EC.
The activity deploys relevant techniques for pollution prevention and control, as set out
in the best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for waste treatment (
57). The activity
meets the relevant associated emission limits (BAT-AELs).
(6) Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosys
­
temsThe activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this Annex.
(53)Production processes refer to any kind of economic activity that produces a material, product or asset; recovered materials refer to the
output of the recovery process.
