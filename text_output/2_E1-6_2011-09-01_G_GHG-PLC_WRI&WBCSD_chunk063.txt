CHAPTER 09 Allocation
guidanceEndnotes
1  The term “common process” can be one or more processes that 
require allocation.
2  As defined in ISO 14044:2006, 4.3.4.3.
3 In some LCA literature, this method is known as the substitution
or avoided-burden method.
4 Steps adapted from ISO 14044:2006, 4.3.4.2.
5  A true closed loop recycling scenario occurs when the recycled 
material does not leave the studied product’s life cycle and
therefore does not require allocation.
6  John Atherton, “Declaration by the Metals Industry on Recycling 
Principles,” International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, 12 no.
1 (2007):59-60.

8  ISO 14044:2006 defines open and closed loop recycling as well 
as open and closed loop allocation procedures. In ISO 14044, an
open loop recycling situation where there is no change in the
inherent properties of the material is treated using a closed loop
allocation procedure.9 Collection may be considered part of the material recovery facility
in some product life cycles.
10 Recycled material that does not leave a product system  
(e.g., scraps that do not leave the control of the production
company) is an example of a closed loop situation. Material that
is recycled at the end-of-life and then used in a different product
(e.g., tires being recycled into asphalt) is an example of an open
loop situation.
11 The collection process is listed as an attributable end-of-life
process; however, the location of this process depends on how
the recycled material is collected, as discussed above and in
chapter 7.

Although in this example using the recycled content
method results in lower emissions and removals
allocated to the studied product, a different scenario
may have the opposite results. To avoid the misuse
or misinterpretation of methodological choices, the
standard includes the following requirements related
to recycling:
•Disclose and justify the method used for recycling;
•Use that same method consistently over time to track
performance, or if the method changes recalculate the
base inventory as required in chapter 14; and
•Disclose the calculated virgin material displacement
separately.
The standard also recommends that companies include
quantitative uncertainty results in their inventory report
(e.g., sensitivity analysis).Additionally, a disclaimer is required as part of the
inventory report to avoid incorrect comparisons of
inventory results based on different allocation methods
(see chapter 13 for more details). In cases where choices
are needed in a general standard to accommodate a
large range of products, companies are encouraged
to look towards available product rules and sector
guidance to ensure consistency and comparability (if
desired) within a product category or sector. Companies
can choose a method other than the recycled content
or closed loop approximation based on product rules or
sector guidance as long as this is disclosed and justified
in the inventory report.
