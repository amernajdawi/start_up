3. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and
take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line
with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports (  655  ), scientific peer-reviewed 
publications and open source (  656  ) or paying models. 
4. The adaptation solutions implemented:
(a) do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people,
of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;
(b) favour nature-based solutions (  657  ) or rely on blue or green infrastructure (  658  ) to the extent possible; 
(c) are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;
(d) are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those
indicators are not met;
(e) where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria
have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening
criteria for that activity.
5. In order for an activity to be considered as an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1), point (b), of
Regulation (EU) 2020/852, the economic operator demonstrates, through an assessment of current and future
climate risks, including uncertainty and based on robust data, that the activity provides a technology, product,
service, information, or practice, or promotes their uses with one of the following primary objectives:
(a) increasing the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of
assets and of other economic activities;
(b) contributing to adaptation efforts of other people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other
economic activities.
