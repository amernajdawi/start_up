[10]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard
guidance [10]   Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standardsources – or “hot spots” – in the life cycle and focus efforts 
on the most cost effective emissions reduction activities.
Product GHG inventories, performed according
to a consistent framework, provide a quantitative
performance metric to set targets for improvement,
track progress. and communicate successes to internal
and external stakeholders. External stakeholders,
including customers, investors, shareholders and others
are increasingly interested in measured and reported
progress in emissions reductions by companies.
Therefore, identifying reduction opportunities, setting
goals and reporting on progress to stakeholders
may help differentiate a company in an increasingly
environmentally conscious marketplace.
Internally, product GHG inventories may be used to
support less GHG-intensive product design choices
and production processes. For example, a shoe
manufacturer seeking to meet a company target of 10 percent lower life cycle emissions from its most
popular shoe might use a product GHG inventory to
determine the most cost effective means of achieving
the target, selecting from options such as optimizing
the distribution network, using less GHG-intensive
materials, or improving energy efficiency at production
facilities. External uses of the performance results
might include communications to regulators, investors,
customers, and local communities, using tools such as
an annual corporate sustainability report.
2.3 Supplier and customer stewardship
From raw material vendors to final consumers, product
inventories provide an opportunity for companies
to engage with stakeholders throughout a product’s
life cycle toward the common goal of reducing GHG
emissions. This engagement may also lead to supply
chain efficiencies and consequent cost savings, build Table [2.1]  Business goals served by a product GHG inventory
Business goal Description
Climate change
management• Identify new market opportunities and regulatory incentives
• Identify climate-related physical and regulatory risks in a product’s life cycle
• Assess risks from fluctuations in energy costs and material availability
Performance
tracking• Focus efforts on efficiency improvements and cost-saving opportunities through
GHG reductions throughout a product’s life cycle
• Set product-related GHG reduction targets and develop strategies to  
achieve goals
• Measure and report GHG performance over time
• Track efficiency improvements throughout a product life cycle over time
Supplier and
customer
stewardship• Partner with suppliers to achieve GHG reductions
• Assess supplier performance for GHG aspects of green procurement efforts
• Reduce GHG emissions and energy use, costs, and risks in the supply chain and
avoid future costs related to energy and emissions
• Launch a customer education campaign to encourage actions that reduce  
GHG emissions
Product
differentiation• Achieve competitive advantage by pursuing GHG reduction opportunities and
cost savings to create a low-emitting product
• Redesign a product to better respond to customer preferences
• Strengthen brand image regarding GHG performance
• Enhance employee retention and recruitment resulting from pride in  
product stewardship
• Strengthen corporate reputation and accountability through public disclosure
