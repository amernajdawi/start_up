(44)  Furthermore, technical screening criteria should also be established for education, human health, social work, arts, 
entertainment and recreation activities. Those activities provide essential services and solutions towards increasing
collective resilience of the whole society and they can increase climate literacy and awareness.  
(45)  The technical screening criteria for determining whether an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially 
to climate change adaptation by including adaptation solutions in accordance with Article 11(1), point (a) of
Regulation (EU) 2020/852 should aim at increasing the resilience of the economic activities against identified
climate risks that are material to those activities. The technical screening criteria should require that the economic
operators concerned perform a climate change risk assessment and implement adaptation solutions that reduce the
most important risks identified in that assessment. The technical screening criteria should also take into account
the context- and location-specific nature of adaptation needs and solutions. Furthermore, the technical screening
criteria should ensure the integrity of the environmental and climate objectives and should not be dispropor Â­
tionately prescriptive as to the type of solutions implemented. Those technical screening criteria should take into
account the need to prevent climate- and weather related disasters and manage risk of such disasters and to ensure
the resilience of critical infrastructure, in accordance with relevant Union law relating to assessing the risk and
mitigating the effects of such disasters.  
(46)  The technical screening criteria for determining whether an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially 
to climate change adaptation by providing adaptation solutions in accordance with Article 11(1), point (b) of
Regulation (EU) 2020/852 should be established for engineering activities and related technical consultancy
dedicated to adaptation to climate change, research, development and innovation, non-life insurance consisting
in underwriting of climate-related perils, and reinsurance. Those activities have the potential to provide adaptation
solutions that contribute substantially to preventing or reducing the risk of the adverse impact of the current
climate and the expected future climate on people, nature, or assets, without increasing the risk of an adverse
impact.  
(47)  The technical screening criteria should recognise that certain economic activities may contribute substantially to 
climate change adaptation by providing adaptation solutions in accordance with Article 11(1), point (b), of
Regulation (EU) 2020/852, or by including adaptation solutions in accordance with the Article 11(1), point (a),
of that Regulation. The technical screening criteria for the forestry activities, restoration of wetlands, programming
and broadcasting, as well as for education, the creative, arts and entertainment activities should recognise that
possibility. Those activities, while they should be adapted to the adverse impact of the current climate and the
expected future climate, also have the potential to provide adaptation solutions that contribute substantially to
preventing or reducing the risk of that adverse impact on people, nature, or assets.  
(48)  The technical screening criteria for determining whether an economic activity contributes substantially to climate 
change adaptation should ensure that the economic activity is made climate resilient or provides solutions to other
activities to become climate resilient. Where an economic activity is made climate resilient, the implementation of
physical and non-physical solutions that substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are
material to that activity represents the substantial contribution of that activity towards climate change adaptation.
It is therefore appropriate that only capital expenditures incurred for all steps necessary for making the activity
climate resilient should be considered as the proportion of capital and operating expenditure related to assets or
processes associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable and that turnover from
that economic activity that has been made resilient should not be counted as derived from products or services
associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable. However, when the core business of
economic activities enabling adaptation in accordance with Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 is
to provide technologies, products, services, information, or practices with the objectives of increasing the level of
resilience to physical climate risks of other people, nature, cultural heritage, assets or of other economic activities,
